"The learned High Court Judge has justified the PW-01â€™s failure to mention to the"
"police that she knew the appellant well, by considering a portion of the evidence"
"of PW-01 where she has stated that she knew the appellant as Chuti Ayya.  It"
"appears that the learned High Court Judge has failed to adequately address and"
"consider  the  overwhelming  evidence  placed  before  the  trial  Court  to  the  effect"
"that the appellant was well known to both the eyewitnesses as he and his family"
"used to be their neighbours over a long period of time. If that fact was correctly"
"considered, there would have been no basis for the learned High Court Judge to"
"determine as to the reliability of the evidence by PW-01 and 02 in that regard."
"It is also clear that both PW-01 and 02 has stated in their evidence they failed to"
"identify the attacker, other than describing his physical features, which goes on"
"to show that they have failed to identify the attacker as the appellant although"
"they were eyewitnesses to the incident. That clearly explains the reason why they"
"have failed to name him as the person who came inside their house and caused"
"cut injuries to the deceased when they made their statements to the police a few"
"hours after the incident."
"According to the evidence of PW-10, the investigating officer, he has obtained an"
"information about a possible suspect only after he inquired from the villagers,"
"and  not  because  of  what  the  two  eyewitnesses  told  him.  He  has  arrested  the"
"appellant based only on the information he received from an informant, which"
"goes on to show that the PW-01 and 02 have failed to identify the appellant at"
"the  time  of  the  incident.  Once  the  arrest  of  the  appellant  becomes  common"
"knowledge, there would be no difficulty for PW-01 and 02 to identify him at the"
"identification  parade  because  of  the  previous  knowledge  they  had  as  to  his"
"identity."
"For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the learned High Court"
"Judge was misdirected when it was determined that the two eyewitnesses had"
"positively identified the appellant at the time of the incident."
