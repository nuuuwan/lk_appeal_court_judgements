"backdrop, I need to firstly, draw my attention to the following specific paragraphs of the"
"aforesaid judgement."
"“Sec. 72 of  this Law is the provision which has to be resorted to in such a situation. The"
"provision of this section requires, by the use of a statutory fiction, the interests of a co-owner,"
"which would, at the time this Law comes into operation be only an undivided share of a larger"
"land owned in common, to be treated as a distinct and separate entity. Such an assumption"
"is  only  ""for  the  purposes  of  this  Law"".  The  purpose,  as  already  stated,  is  primarily  to"
"determine the extent of the holding of such a person so that such holding could thereafter be"
"restricted to an extent of only 50 acres.” (Emphasis added) (at p.129)"
"“The moment this Law comes into operation the undivided share of a co-owner, whether he"
"be one whose interests are over fifty acres or not, becomes, in the eye of the law, a distinct and"
"separate entity, equal to the undivided extent he was earlier entitled to in the common land."
"Such entity is, at that time, still not identified or located on the ground, as distinct from the"
"larger land.”  (Emphasis added) (at p.129)"
"“The effect of the operation of the provisions of sec. 7 is to bring about a separation or partition"
"of the undivided share of a person, who, at the time this Law comes into operation, owns such"
"interests in common with several others, and transform such undivided share into a distinct"
"and separate portion. Even though still only notional and only existing on paper, yet, the law"
"requires the extent of land such person is entitled to, to be treated as a distinct and separate"
"entity.” (Emphasis added) (at p. 129)"
"“Even in regard to the determination of the specific portion to be given over to a statutory"
"lessee, who was once a co-owner, the other co-owners would not be without an opportunity of"
"making representations to the Commission if their interests are affected. Even though there is"
"no express provision granting an affected co-owner an opportunity of being heard before a"
"statutory determination is made, yet, as the concept of determination connotes a hearing of"
"affected  parties,  ""the  justice  of  the  common  law""  will  step  in  and  provide  him  with  such"
"opportunity.” (Emphasis added) (at p. 133)"
