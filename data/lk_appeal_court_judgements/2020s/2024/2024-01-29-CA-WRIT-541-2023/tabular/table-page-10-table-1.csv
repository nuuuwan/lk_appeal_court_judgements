"අයුම්පෙ මෙ මැණික් ගැරීසම් බලපත්‍රයක් නිකුත් කිරීමට තීරණය කළ බව සමයින්ද"
"කාරුණිකව දන්දවමි.”"
"I believe that the long sentence quoted above raises ambiguity about the undivided 2/3rd"
"portion and also how the 3rd Respondent has arrived at such a decision. In my view the 3rd"
"Respondent has failed to consider any of the vital issues I have mentioned above in this"
"judgement.  It  is  obvious  that  the  3rd  Respondent  has  not  considered  relevant  material"
"concerning the question of whether the land subject to the gemming license ('X10') is co-"
"owned. The 3rd Respondent ought to take into account several other issues regarding the"
"title of parties including the issue whether the land described in item 16 of the SD can be"
"separately  and  distinctly  identified  and  located  on  the  ground  of  the  larger  land  called"
"'Halgaha Digana'. This is especially because the determination of the said Jinawathie case,"
"as I have decided earlier, cannot be applied to the instant case. Whether the subject land"
"falls within the category of 'dewalagam' lands is also a vital issue that needs to be addressed."
"Similarly, I take the view that the 3rd Respondent has not adopted the due effect of the"
"aforesaid Regulations when arriving at the impugned decisions.   It appears that the 3rd"
"Respondent has not taken into consideration the said Regulations 2020 and has failed to"
"exercise his duties diligently by not duly inquiring upon the specific requisites mentioned"
"therein. In other words, the 3rd Respondent without giving effect to the two main limbs"
"(i.e., (i) Ownership of the land; (ii) consent of the other co-owners who own at least 2/3rd"
"ownership) of the said Regulations 2020 has attempted to give an undue interpretation to"
"what was decided in the said Jinawathie case even without making a single reference to"
"the said Judgement.  It is a puzzle to this Court as to how the 3rd Respondent gained such"
"wisdom  to  adopt  the  rationale  in  the  said  Jinawathie  case  to  overlook  the  fundamental"
"requisites stipulated in those Regulations."
"I  take  the  view  that  claiming  the  ownership  of  a  separate  and  distinct  portion  of  land"
"described in a SD issued under the Land Reform Law may confirm any person's ownership"
"of  a  land.  Nevertheless,  for  the  purpose  of  issuing  a  gemming  license  under  the  Act,"
"proving ownership through a SD is not sufficient when the extent of the land in the SD"
"and in the license are different and the land described in the SD cannot be separately and"
"distinctly identified or located on the ground. Especially when a land subjected to a SD"
"cannot be separately and distinctly identified or located on the ground, as in the case, such"
