"affected if the license were granted to any of the parties involved in the instant Application."
"No adequate evidence has been made available to this Court through affidavits to arrive"
"at a clear finding on the actual title of the Petitioners or the 5th Respondent.  Although the"
"5th Respondent has tendered to this Court a pedigree such has been annexed only to his"
"written submissions."
"In addition to the above, the Petitioners contend that the land subjected to the said Deed"
"No. 72 is also an undivided land and thus, the predecessors of the 5th Respondent had no"
"divided land/share to transfer in favour of the 5th Respondent. Further, the Petitioners"
"referring to Deed No. 1745 attested on 09.08.1995 (at bottom page 290 of ‘X1’) assert that"
"the  3rd vendor  to  Deed  No.  72  having  undivided  1/4th  share  of  'Halgaha  Digana'  land"
"(which is the extent of 3 Amuna) could not possibly transfer a divided portion of land as"
"described in the schedule to the said Transfer Deed No. 72."
"A careful consideration of the contents of the SD marked ‘P42’ implies that the said SD"
"has been made to deposit the same in favour of the testamentary case No. 31/T which was"
"pending  in  the  District  Court  of  Panadura.  Furthermore,  the  5th  Respondent's  claim  in"
"respect of the SD is based on the block of land described in its item 16. The said block of"
"land is described in the SD as an undivided portion of Lot No. 199 which is within the"
"'Halgaha Digana' land and its extent is A00- R02- P15. However, the license marked as"
"'X10' has been issued in respect of a portion of the said Lot No. 199 which is in extent of"
"A01- R00- P30. Thus, it appears that the license 'X10' has been granted to a larger land"
"than  the  block  of  land  secured  under  the  said  SD.  This  clearly  implies  that  the  land"
"described in item No.16 in the SD marked 'P42' has not been clearly identified or located"
"on the ground and it is further evinced with the existence of the word 'undivided' in the"
"said paragraph of the SD. Therefore, claims made by the 5th Respondent based on the said"
"SD need to be considered only upon clear evidence in respect of his actual title."
"Moreover, the judgement in the said Jinawathie case has been pronounced well before the"
"said Act came into operation and as such there was no necessity for the Supreme Court to"
"give  thought  to  the  Regulations  promulgated  under  the  said  Act.  Those  Regulations"
"expressly restrict the Authority granting any gemming license to any person unless such"
"person fulfills the specific requirements in Regulations 2022. Hence, the Authority is duty"
"bound to inquire whether those requisites have been duly satisfied before granting license"
"to any person especially when the land described in the SD cannot be physically identified"
