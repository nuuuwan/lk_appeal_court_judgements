"a declarant under the said Law and thereafter to restrict such holding to an extent of 50"
"acres. As per the requirement of law, it is important to ascertain the extent of such a portion"
"of  land,  for  the  same  to  be  treated  as  a  distinct  and  separate  entity.  In  this  regard  the"
"relevant block of land to be actually demarcated on the ground is also very important.  The"
"said  judgement  has  been  formulated  in  a  scenario  where  none  of  the  co-owners,  the"
"defendants-appellants  and  the  wife  of  the  3rd  defendant-appellant  of  the  said  Jinawathie"
"case have not raised any dispute to the title of the plaintiff-respondent to the extent of 78"
"acres referred to therein."
"Another significant aspect considered by the Supreme Court in the said judgement is the"
"necessity of giving an opportunity for the co-owners to make representations to the LRC"
"if their interests are affected. Thus, the connotation of hearing of affected parties has been"
"established  in  the  said  judgement.  The  Supreme  Court  has  observed  that  even  after  a"
"particular portion of land is considered as distinct and separate from the larger land, each"
"one of the co-owners would come within the category of “every person who was interested"
"in such land”."
"However, when considering the facts and circumstances of the instant case, it becomes"
"clear that the Petitioners and the 5th Respondent are at disagreement over whether the land"
"upon  which  the  impugned  gemming  license  was  granted  is  a  portion of  the  larger  land"
"called ‘Halgaha Digana’. It is paramount to note that the Land Reform Law applies only"
"to agricultural land as such a crucial question arises in the instant Application whether"
"“paraveni nilakaraya''3 is left out of the definition of agricultural land stipulated in the said"
"Law.  While  it  is  debatable  whether  the  subject  land  qualifies  as  Dewalagam  Land,  the"
"reference to the ""Rajakari panguwa"" 4in the said Deed of Transfer No. 72 implies that the"
"Uggal Aluth Nuwara Kataragama Dewalaya is also an interested party whose rights may be"
"3 “According to SAWERS there were four chief classes of tenants (q), namely; - (c) Nilakarayas, who held"
"panguwas on condition of cultivating the muttettu, or performing services attached by custom to their"
"particular holdings.” (Vide- 'The Laws and Customs of the Sinhalese or Kandyan Law' by Frederic Austin"
"Hayley, Navarang, New Delhi 1993 at p.239)."
"4 ""paraveni pangu” shall mean an allotment or share of land in a temple or nindagama village held in perpetuity"
"by one or more holders, subject to the performance of certain services to the temple or nindagama proprietor;”"
"(Vide- 'Buddhist Ecclesiastical Law' by Wickrema Weerasooria, 2011, p.211)."
