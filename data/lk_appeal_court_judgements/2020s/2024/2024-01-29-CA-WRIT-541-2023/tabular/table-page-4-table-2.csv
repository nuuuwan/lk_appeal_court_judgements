"The  5th  Respondent  in  this  regard  relies  on  the  judgement  of  Jinawathie  and  Others  v."
"Emalin Perera (1986) 2 Sri L.R. 121. Accordingly, he asserts that;"
"“Once the statutory determination is made the person in whose favour it was made"
"becomes owner of the land specified in the determination with all the incidents of"
"ownership. The land does not then cease to be a distinct and separate entity and it"
"does not become once again an undivided portion of the larger land from which"
"such specified portion was carved out.”"
