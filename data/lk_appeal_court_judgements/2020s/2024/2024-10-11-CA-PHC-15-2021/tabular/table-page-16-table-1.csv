"In  the  case  of  Walker  Sons  &  Co.  (U.K.)  Ltd.  v.  Gunathilake  and  Others19,"
"Thamotheram J. observed, after considering the judgment of Basnakyake C.J. in"
"Bandahamy  v.  Senanayake20,  that  as  a  rule,  two  judges  sitting  together  could"
"follow a previous decision of two judges but where two judges sitting together"
"are unable to agree with a decision of a similar bench, the practice is to reserve"
"the case for the decision of a fuller bench."
"Conclusion"
"In light of the above analysis, I find that the learned High Court Judge, in his"
"Order dated 29th January 2021, has appropriately examined the relevant facts,"
"statutory provisions, and judicial precedents. He has arrived at a just conclusion"
"in dismissing the application for the prerogative Writs sought by the Appellant."
"Therefore, I dismiss this appeal, subject to a cost of Rs. 25,000/-."
