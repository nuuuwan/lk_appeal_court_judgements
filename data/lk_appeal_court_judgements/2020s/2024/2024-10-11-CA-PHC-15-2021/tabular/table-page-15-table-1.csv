"deposit  the  remaining  balance  required  under  the  Rule  as  the  appeal  deposit."
"However, the Court of Appeal rejected the Appellant's entitlement on the basis"
"that  the  Supreme  Court's  decision  in  the  Sebastian  Fernando’s  case,  which"
"allowed time for the Appellant to pay the remaining 10% deposit, was merely"
"obiter dicta18."
"Relying  on  this,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  contended  that  the"
"Appellant in the present case should similarly have been given a chance to make"
"the deposit."
"However,  I  am  unable  to  find  any  such  statement  in  the  Sebastian  Fernando"
"judgment. As a result, it is clear that there is no judicial precedent supporting the"
"granting  an  opportunity  to  remedy  the  deposit deficiency. Accordingly,  I  hold"
"that no judicial precedents exist to permit the Appellant to rectify the defects in"
"the appeal deposit, and doing so would also contravene the Rules."
"Principle of stare decisis"
"In  light  of  the  above  analysis,  I  conclude  that,  despite  the  Court  of  Appeal"
"repeatedly  asserting  that  the  obiter  dicta  in  Sebestian  Fernando’s  case,  which"
"states that Rule 49 (xii)(a) is ultra vires, and the Supreme Court's determination"
"in Somaratne’s case that the Rule is intra vires, the same question continues to"
"be reagitated in appeals, as seen in this case. Specifically, His Lordship Janak de"
"Silva J. has thoroughly analyzed both judgments, preferring to follow the latter,"
"which affirms that Rule 49 (xii)(a) is intra vires."
"In this context, I am of the view that rearguing the same issue before this Court"
"in appeals, without pursuing appropriate legal avenues to challenge the Rule, is"
"an  unproductive  practice  that  wastes  the  Court's  energy  and  resources.  Such"
"conduct should be discouraged."
