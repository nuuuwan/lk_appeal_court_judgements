"‘Rule 49 (xii)(a) was made under the Co-operative Societies Law No. 5 of 1972"
"by the relevant Minister of the central government. He was exercising a power"
"given under a law in the whole country and not only within the Central Province."
"Hence it could not have been the subject matter of a direct attack as to its vires"

"There is a general rule in the construction of Statutes that what  a Court or"
