"available have been exhausted 7. It is trite law that if there are alternative remedies, the"
"court would not exercise its writ jurisdiction. In SC Appeal 52/20218, it was held that;"
"“With regard to the powers vested with the Court of Appeal under Article 140"
"in issuing orders in the nature of writs, it is well settled that when an alternative"
"and  equally  efficacious  remedy  is  available  to  a  party,  the  party  should  be"
"required to pursue that remedy before invoking the Writ jurisdiction.”"
"This  position  was  considered  in  the  case  of  Ishak  V.  Lakshman  Perera,  Director  of"
"Customs and Others9 as follows;"
"“Where there is an alternative procedure which will provide the applicant with"
"a satisfactory remedy the Courts will usually insist on an applicant exhausting"
"that remedy before seeking judicial review. In doing so the Court is coming to a"
"discretionary decision.” Where there is  a choice of  another separate process"
"outside the Courts, a true question for the exercise of discretion exists. For the"
"Court to require the alternative procedure to be exhausted prior to resorting to"
"judicial review is in accord with the judicial review being properly regarded as"
"being  a  remedy  of  last  resort.  It  is  important  that  the  process  should  not  be"
"clogged with unnecessary cases, which are perfectly capable of being dealt with"
"in another tribunal. It can also be the situation that Parliament, by establishing"
"an  alternative  procedure,  indicated  either  expressly  or  by  implication  that  it"
"intends  that  procedure  to  be  used,  in  exercising  its  discretion  the  Court  will"
"attach importance to the indication of Parliament intention.” (emphasis added)"
