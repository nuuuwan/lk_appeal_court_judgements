"The contention of
the learned Counsel appearing for
the Petitioner is that
the"
"decision of
the 1st Respondent
that
the date of
termination was the date of the"
"judgment
of
the Court of Appeal
in case bearing No. CA. Writ-167/2010,
is"
"ultra-vires, arbitrary,
illegal and capricious and whereas the date of termination"
"should be on 05-05-2009."
"The
central
issue which has to be determined by this Court
is whether
the"
"termination
of
employment
of
the
said
Respondents
is

or"
"12-12-2018."
