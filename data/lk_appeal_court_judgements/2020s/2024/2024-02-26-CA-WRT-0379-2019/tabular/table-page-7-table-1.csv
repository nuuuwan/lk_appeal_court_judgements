"the 3rd
to 21st Respondents should be the date of the judgement of the Court of"
"Appeal, namely 12-12-2018 is veracious and justifiable."
"The Petitioner did not adduce any
evidence
in proof
of
salaries
of
the said"
"Respondents.
In this scenario,
the 1st Respondent, in terms of the provisions of"
"the National Minimum Wages of Workers Act No. 3 of 2016, has taken the base"
"salary
of
the
employees
as Rs.
10,000/-
per month in calculation of
the"
"compensation. Under section 3 (1) of
the said Act,
the minimum monthly wage"
"for all workers in any industry of service shall be Rs. 10,000/-. Moreover,
the"
"1st Respondent has adhered to the relevant compensation formula set out
in"
"Extra Ordinary Gazette No. 1384/7 dated 15-03-2005."
"It
is to be noted that although the learned Counsel
for
the Petitioner took up"
"the position that
it
is not correct
to pay compensation to the employees who"
"have retired before 12-12-2018, as the Petitioner failed to submit the names of"
"such employees to the 1st Respondent, the said contention is devoid of merits."
"For the foregoing reasons,
I hold that there is no basis to review the decision of"
"the 1st Respondent marked as P3. Thus, the Application is dismissed with costs"
"fixed at Rs. 75,000/- payable by the Petitioner to the 3rd to 21st Respondents."
"Application dismissed with costs."
