"In the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Thamaratnam, (Srikantha Law Reports Vol-IV"
"page 47) it was held that;"
"“Revision  is  a  discretionary  remedy  and  will  not  be  available  unless  the"
"application  discloses  circumstances  which  shocks  the  conscience  of  the"
"Court.”"
"In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd. Vs. Jayasekare (1997) 2 SLR 365 it"
"was held thus;"
"“Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has"
"occurred  due  to  a  fundamental  rule  of  procedure  being  violated,  but  only"
"when  a  strong  case  is  made  out  amounting  to  a  positive  miscarriage  of"
"justice.”"
"In  his  petition  before  this  Court,  under  Paragraph  16,  the  petitioner  has"
"mentioned  several  grounds,  which  he  has  termed  as  exceptional  grounds"
"available to him. Therefore, it is my view that the petitioner needs to establish"
"that the mentioned exceptional circumstances exist for him to succeed in this"
"application."
"The petitioner is seeking to revise or set aside interim protection orders made by"
"the learned Additional Magistrate of Negombo on 25-04-2022 and 29-04-2022."
"On  25-04-2022,  the  learned  Additional  Magistrate  of  Negombo  has  heard  the"
"application made under the provision of the Act.  After hearing evidence of the"
"aggrieved party and other witnesses, the learned Magistrate has pronounced the"
"said interim protection order. Thereafter, the said interim order had been served"
"on the petitioner. It needs to be noted that when this matter was taken up for"
"hearing, the petitioner has also been present with legal representation and he"
"has been allowed to cross-examine the witnesses."
"When this matter was mentioned again on 29-04-2022, the learned Magistrate"
"has extended the interim protection order for 14 days and the matter has been"
"fixed on further inquiry on 20-05-2022."
