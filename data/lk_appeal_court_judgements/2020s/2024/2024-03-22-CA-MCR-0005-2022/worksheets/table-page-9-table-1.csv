"Besides that, this is an order, not made ex parte but after an inter parte inquiry."
"The petitioner has been allowed to cross-examine the witnesses. It is clear from"
"the interim protection order that the learned Magistrate has considered all the"
"relevant  facts  and  the  circumstances,  and  also  has  considered  the  evidence"
"placed before the Court in issuing the interim protection order."
"As the Act itself has provided a solution for the petitioner to show cause before"
"the Court if he was dissatisfied with the interim protection order, he has no bar"
"to  go  before  the  same  Court  and  establish  his  case  rather  than  seeking  to"
"challenge the interim protection order, which is a temporary order."
"If the petitioner is dissatisfied with any final protection order pronounced by the"
"learned Magistrate, he has the right to appeal against such an order in terms of"
"Section 17 of the Act to the relevant Provincial High Court."
"For  the  reasons  considered  as  above,  I  find  no  basis  to  conclude  that  the"
"petitioner has any exceptional circumstances to seek the discretionary remedy"
"of revision from this Court. Accordingly, the revision application is dismissed."
"The  Registrar  of  the  Court  is  directed  to  communicate  this  judgement  to  the"
"relevant Magistrateâ€™s Court of Negombo for information."
