"2021. It is noteworthy that the Petitioners are not contesting the letter dated 20.12.2019 by"
"which  SLC  extends  the      invitation  for  the  Club  to  participate  in  the  ""SLC  invitation  T20"

"Another important objection raised by the Respondents is that the Petitioners are not entitled"
"to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court concerning the affairs mentioned in the instant"
"Application. The Respondents contend that the relationship between the SLC and the Club"
"is contractual and as such this Court cannot grant the reliefs as prayed for in the prayer of the"
"Petition. It is observed that this Court has constantly decided that the Court of Appeal has the"
