"decisions in those documents nor the corresponding decision-making process meet any of the"
"previously stated requirements to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court. Anyhow, what"
"would be the consequence if this Court proceeded to quash the main impugned letter marked"
"‘P5(a)’?  To  my  mind,  a  mere  annulment  of  ‘P5(a)’  would  not  prevent  SLC  from  passing"
"another resolution at a special general meeting to amend or suspend again the said Rule 5.2.1."
"It is paramount that the decision taken at the special general meeting of the Membership of"
"the SLC (as stipulated in ‘P9(A)’) will remain unchanged even if this Court decides to quash"
"‘P5(a)’ which is a mere Notice to membership of SLC and Cricket playing non-member clubs."
"In such a scenario I am reluctant to exercise the writ jurisdiction of this Court in respect of"
"the reliefs sought by the Petitioners."
"However, for completeness, I am inclined to accept the submissions made on behalf of the"
"Respondents  that  the Petitioner's  conduct  especially  through  ‘P6’  and  also  not  challenging"
"‘P7’, amounts to acquiescence concerning the provisions of Rule 5.1.2. Moreover, I cannot"
"possibly overlook the delay in challenging the impugned decisions by the Petitioners and I"
"have reached this finding considering the overall circumstances of this case. The only other"
"effective relief sought by the Petitioner is for a writ of Prohibition preventing the Respondents"
"from  holding  any  further  SLC  Major  Tournaments  in  the  Tier  ‘B’  category  without  the"
"participation  of  the  Petitioners  Club.  In  light  of  the  reasons  given  above,  I  hold  that  the"
"Petitioners  are  not entitled  to  even  a  writ  of  Prohibition  as  prayed  for in  the  prayer  of  the"
"Petition. In the circumstances, I proceed to dismiss the instant Application of the Petitioners."
"Application is dismissed."
