"205 – SC 3136."
"It was stated by the Chief Justice of India that,"
"“Noise is more than a just nuisance. It constitutes a real and present danger"
"to people’s health day and night, at home, at work, and at play, noise can"
"produce serious physical and psychological stress. No one is immune to this"
"stress. Though we seem to adjust, to noise by ignoring it, the ear, in fact,"
"never closes and the body still responds- sometimes with extreme tension,"
"as to a strain sound in the night.”"
"Further “that noise is a type of atmospheric pollution. It is shadowy public"
"enemy whose menace has increased in the modern era of industrialization"
"and technological advancement.”"
