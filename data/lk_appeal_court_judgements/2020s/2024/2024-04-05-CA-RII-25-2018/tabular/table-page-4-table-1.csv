"Umma  gets  4/18  shares.  This  appears  to  be  correct  even  according  to  the"
"pedigree adopted by the learned District Judge."
"According to that pedigree, relied upon by the 4A defendant, title comes to Asia"
"Nona, Abdul Satar’s daughter who is the 6th defendant. The 4th defendant says"
"he and his wife are in possession in lots 1 and 2 in plan ‘X’ which is lot 2 in plan"
"‘Y’ on the rights of Asia Nona. The learned District Judge has not given any share"
"to the 4A defendant. Among other things, he has said that Thangachchi Umma"
"by P1 in 1874 transferred her share to one Meera Lebbe. But the position of the"
"4A defendant is that by P1 Thangachchi Umma transferred only ¼ of her rights."
"It does not appear that the learned District Judge has considered the title"
"of 4A defendant and his right to possess the aforesaid lots exclusively on"
"the  basis  that  it  is  a  separate  land  called  ‘Sawalakkara  Walauwa’,  in  the"
"correct perspective. The 4A defendant, after the judgment, in 2010 has gone"
"before  the  Civil  Appellate  court  of  Kandy  which  court  in  2014  dismissed  the"
"appeal on a technical ground."
