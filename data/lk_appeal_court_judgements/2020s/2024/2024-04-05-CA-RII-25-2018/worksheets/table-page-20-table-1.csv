"are  also  filed,  the  district  judge  must  find  everything  by  himself  or  herself,"
"whether the parties take steps or not. But surely, as in this case, if the plaintiff"
"in evidence admits, that, a certain former co owner had heirs, which have neither"

"parties,  the  district  judge  must  take  a  step  forward  to  find  their  title,  if  any,"
