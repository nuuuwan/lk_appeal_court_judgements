"1 The delivery of this judgment was delayed as the original case record P 1946 called from the District Court"
"of Matale was missing. The Registry maintained the position for sometime that it is with me. They showed"
"an  entry  where  my former  Peon  has  signed.  But  what  had  happened  was  that  on  a  date  thereafter the"
"docket as well as the original case record of District Court of Matale had been taken to open court and then"
"during the ordinary course gone to the Registry. As the Registry was not accepting this, on 19.01.2024 I"
"gave an order from the Bench for the Registrar to trace that record and send to me; and on a day following,"
"i.e., 29.02.2024 it came; and hence this judgment. The original case record of District Court of Matale 1946"
"P had been in the Registry during the period they maintained that it is with me."
