"","that building A and lot 01 represents one unit). But in X, only lot 01 in"
"","extent 2.73 perches was claimed before the surveyor (according to"
"","the  plan)  by  04  and  06  defendants.  Lot  02  was  claimed  before  the"
"","surveyor  by  the  02nd  defendant.  Hence  the  extent  claimed  by  the"
"","predecessors  of  04A  defendant  in  plan  X  is  2.73  perches  (lot  01).  As"
"","already said the statement of claims of 04 and 06 defendants claim lots"
"","01 and 02 in plan No. 3847 (Y) made in 1991. They are in extent 4.17"
"","perches. As it will be recalled in X this area was 4.03 perches. So in both"

"","defendant (by their statement of claims) and the area claimed by the 04A"
"","defendant (in his evidence) are almost same. But, in plan Y of 1991 too,"
"","Mr. Samarasinghe has recorded, that, the 04th defendant claimed lot"
"","02 with building A standing on it. This is in extent 2.87 perches. On"
"","that plan there was no claimant for lot  01.  So in X the 04th  defendant"
"","claimed lot 01 of 2.73 perches in extent. In Y the 04th defendant claimed"
"","lot 02 in extent of 2.87 perches."
"(iii)","03,05 and 07 defendants in their statement of claims dated 1996 (before"
"","the coming of X) claimed to exclude lot 05 and its building I on plan No."
"","3847 (Y). There is no clash of these defendants with the 04A defendant."
