"The Appellant also cited the following extract from the judgement of Girvan L.J."
"in the above case,"
"‘As Hewitt’s ‘Joint Venture’ 3rd Ed at para 1.11 makes clear it refers to a range"
"of collaborative business arrangements, the fundamental characteristic of a joint"
"venture  being  collaboration  between  the  participants  involving  a  significant"
"degree  of  integration  between  the  joint  venturers.  The  key  element  to  be"
"considered and agreed by the joint venturers is the degree and nature of that"
"collaboration. Joint ventures  may take the form of a contractual  alliance,  a"
"partnership or a corporate joint venture (…) There are clear legal differences"
"between  running  a  joint  venture  as  a  company  and  running  it  as  a  loose"
"contractual alliance.  These include the management framework, the  decision-"
"making arrangements, the funding arrangements and the financial powers of the"
"entity (a company, for example, having powers to raise money by way of floating"
"charges). Clearly there will be different exist strategies and issued relating to the"
"division of profits.’ (Emphasis added)"
"There are two known types of joint ventures. One is agreeing to co-operate with"
"another business in a limited and specific way. The two partners could agree to"
"a contract setting out the terms and conditions how the  business would work."
"Alternatively, a separate joint venture business, like in this instance, could be set"
"up. The above options are alternatives to having a formal business partnership or"
"merge the two businesses. In this instance, it is a newly incorporated company"
"designated to manage a specific business endeavor. Each partner owns shares in"
"the company and agreed how the company should be managed by entering into"
"a joint venture agreement."
"The Appellant, citing the Articles of Association31 of the Appellant company and"
"the  joint  venture  agreement32  dated  2nd  January  2010,  submitted  that  the  total"
"shareholding  of  the  Appellant  company  is  equally  divided  between  the  two"
"investing companies. It was also submitted that Clause 1.5 of the joint venture"
