"learned  High  Court  Judge, 
in  the  case  of  Farook  Vs.  Gunawardena,"
"Government Agent Ampara (1980) 2 SLR 343 at 345, it was held,"
"“At the inquiry before the Magistrate, the only plea by way of defence that"
"the petitioner can put forward is that he is in possession or occupation of the"
"land upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in"
"accordance with any written law and that such permit or authority is in force"
"and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid. Section 9 (2) is to the effect"
"that 
the  Magistrate  cannot  call 
for  any  evidence 
from 
the  competent"
"authority in support of the application under section 5 which means that the"
"Magistrate cannot call upon the competent authority to prove that the land"
"described 
in 
the  Schedule 
to 
the  application 
is  a  State 
land 
[section"
"5(1)(a)(ii)].  Therefore,  the  petitioner  will  not  have  an  opportunity  of  raising"
"the  question  whether 
the 
land 
is  a  State  or  private 
land  before 
the"
"Magistrate.”"
"Held further:"
"“The  structure  of  the  Act  would  also  make 
it  appear  that  where  the"
"competent  authority  had  formed  the  opinion  that  any  land  is  State  land,"
"even the Magistrate is not competent to question his opinion. Alternate relief"
"is given by section 12 which empowers any person claiming to be the owner"
"of a land to institute action against the State for the vindication of his title"
"within  6  months  of  the  order  of  ejectment  and  section  13  is  to  the  effect"
"where action is instituted by a person, if a decision is made in favour of that"
"person,  he  will  be  entitled  to  recover  reasonable  compensation  for  the"
"damage  sustained  by  reason  of  his  having  being  compelled  to  deliver"
"possession of such land.”"
