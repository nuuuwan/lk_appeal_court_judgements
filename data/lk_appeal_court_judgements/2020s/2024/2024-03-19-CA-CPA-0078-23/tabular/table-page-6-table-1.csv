"should  take  effect  from  the  date  of  the amendment.  It  was the  position  of  the"
"learned  Counsel  that  the  indictment  against  the  petitioner  has  been  wrongly"
"presented and has no validity before the law."
"It was the complaint of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the learned"
"High Court Judge has, in fact, correctly determined that it was the substantive"
"law  that  has  been  amended  and  not  the  procedural  law,  but  has  failed  to"
"appreciate the relevant legal provisions in that regard in its correct perspective."
"The learned Counsel moved for the reliefs as sought in the prayer of the petition."

"in terms of the Amendment Act No. 40 of 2011 made to the Prevention of Money"
"Laundering Act No. 5 of 2006, on the basis that the petitioner falls under the"
"provisions of section 3(3) of the Act, as amended."
"The relevant Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Act No. 40 of 2011"
