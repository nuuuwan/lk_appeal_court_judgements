"Money Laundering Act No. 5 of 2006 as amended by Amendment Act No.40 of"
"2011."
"After  the  indictment  was  served  on  the  petitioner,  the  learned  Counsel  who"
"represented  the  petitioner  before  the  High  Court  has  raised  a  preliminary"
"objection as to the maintainability of the action against the petitioner, urging the"
"Court to reject the indictment and discharge the petitioner from the proceedings."
"The  essence  of  the  objection  had  been  that  the  charge  was  based  on  the"
"amendment brought to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act by Amendment"
"Act    No.  40  of  2011,  where  any  other  person  than  an  accused  had  also  been"
"brought under the purview of section 3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering"
"Act No. 5 of 2006."
"It had been the position of the learned Counsel that the relevant amendment has"
"not  provided  for  any  retrospective  effect,  and  since  the  charges  relating  to  a"
"period  before  the  Amendment  Act  came  into  effect,  the  charges  against  the"
"petitioner  cannot  be  maintained. 
It  had  been  contended 
further  that  the"
"petitioner has been charged for an offence that was not in existence during the"
"time relevant for the charge."
"After hearing the oral submissions in this  connection, the learned High  Court"
"Judge  has  allowed  the 
learned  Counsel 
for  the  petitioner  as  well  as  the"
"prosecuting State Counsel to file written submissions, and has pronounced his"
"order on 24-05-2023 overruling the objection taken and fixing the matter for the"
"pre-trial conference."
"It  is  against  this  order  the  petitioner  has  sought  to  invoke  the  revisionary"
"jurisdiction of this Court."
"It is trite law that the remedy of revision, which is an extraordinary  discretionary"
"remedy can only be granted under exceptional circumstances."
