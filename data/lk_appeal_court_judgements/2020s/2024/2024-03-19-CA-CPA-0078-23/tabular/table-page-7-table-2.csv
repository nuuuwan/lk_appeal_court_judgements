"N.S. Bindra on Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edition at 238 discusses the",""
"presumption against retrospectivity in the following manner;",""
"","“As  a  general  rule  every  statute  is  deemed  to  be  prospective,  unless  by"
"","express provision or necessary implication it is to have a retrospective effect."
"Whether  a  statute 
is 
to  have","retrospective  effect  depends  upon 
its"
"","interpretation  regard  to  well  settled  rules  of  construction.  Retrospection  is"
"","not be presumed; but many statutes have been regarded as  retrospective"
"","without declaring so. Remedial statutes are always regarded as prospective"
"","but  declaratory  statutes  are  retrospective  in  nature.  The  statute  would"
"","operate  when  the  intent  that  it  should  so  operate  clearly  appears  from  a"
"","consideration  of  the  act  as  a  whole,  or  from  the  terms  thereof,  which"
"unqualifiedly  give  the  statute  a  retrospective  operation  or","imperatively"
"","require  such  a  construction,  or  negate  the  idea  that  it  is  to  apply  only  to"
"","future cases. If the Court is in doubt whether the statute was intended to"
"operate it should resolve the doubt against such operation.”",""
