"3.  Every  litigant  has  a  vested  right  in  substantive  law  but  no  such  right"
"exists in procedural law. “"
"Needless to say, by enacting the Amendment Act No. 40 of 2011, a new group of"
"persons had been added to the provisions of  section 3 that existed until then,"
"and thereby making them, which includes the petitioner of this matter, subjected"
"to be indicted before the High Court, which in my view is an amendment to the"
"substantive law in that regard."
"I find that as pointed out correctly by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that"
"the two judgments cited by the learned High Court Judge in the order have no"
"relevance to the preliminary objection raised before the High Court."
"In  the  case  of  Mrs.  Dorothy  Silva  Vs.  Inspector  of  Police,  City  Vise  Squad"
"Pettah (supra), the matter considered was the construction given to the word"
"“brothel” in the Brothel’s Ordinance and not whether it has retrospective effect"
"or not. The matter considered in the case of  Maharaja  Organization  Limited"
"Vs. Viacom International Inc. (supra) was in relation to the question whether"
"an appeal or leave to appeal that lie against an order of the District Court or the"
"Commercial  High  Court.  The  quotation  cited  from  the  said  judgment  by  the"
"learned High Court Judge was in relation to that question, and not in relation to"
"a question whether a statute has retrospective effect or not."
"I find that even the learned High Court Judge has come to a finding in his order"
"that the amendment in relation to the  section under which the petitioner  was"
"indicted has been to the substantive law in that regard."
"For matters of clarity, I would like to reproduce the relevant portion of the order,"
"that appears on page 9, which reads thus;"
