"","22. Accordingly,  I  reject  the  contention  of  the  appellant  that  the"
"deceased did not make the statement marked ‘පැ. 2’.",""
"","23. The  post-mortem  report  prepared  by  PW8  has  been  produced"
"as  evidence  and  marked  as","‘පැ.  3’.  Dr.  Rathnayake  has"
"expressed  an  opinion 
that","the  death  of 
the  deceased  has"
"","occurred  due  to  the  injuries  caused  by  extensive  burns  to  the"
"","body  of  the  deceased  and  concluded  that  the  bodily  injuries"
"","inflicted by the burns have been sufficient in the ordinary course"
"of nature to cause the death of the deceased.",""
"","24. It  has  been  established  by  the  prosecution  that  the  appellant"
"","was the only person present with the deceased at the particular"
"","location  when  the  latter  was  in  flames.  The  appellant  had  not"
"","attempted to extinguish the fire until  PW1 and PW3 arrived at"
"","the scene of the  incident. Further, it  can  be  observed that the"
"","appellant has not attempted to extinguish the fire to the best of"
"","his  ability.  The  appellant  has  in  a  lethargic  manner  splashed"
"","some water onto the deceased’s body, which has been brought"
"for drinking purposes and was collected in a pot.",""
"","25.  The  appellant  has  also  not  made  a  proper  attempt  to  collect"
"","sufficient water from an external source and use it to extinguish"
"","the fire. Further, the appellant has not cried out for help at the"
"","first  given  opportunity  nor  has  he  made  an  attempt  to  seek"
"","medical  intervention  on  behalf  of  the  deceased  without  delay."
"","When  the  statement  marked  ‘පැ.  2’  was  read  in  evidence,  the"
