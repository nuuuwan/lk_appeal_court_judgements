"20.  The  statement  of  the  deceased  marked  as  ‘පැ.  2’  has  been"
"recorded  by  PW6  on  26.03.2011.  Prior 
to 
recording 
the"
"statement  marked  ‘පැ.  2’.  PW6  has  proceeded  to  record  a"
"statement of PW4 the daughter of the deceased. The statement"
"of  PW4  has  been 
recorded  by  PW6  on  25.03.2011.  The"
"statement  has  been  recorded  at  a  location  close  to  the  place"
"where 
the 
fire  happened. 
In 
those 
circumstances, 
it 
is"
"questionable  as to whether  PW4 was  always  by the bedside of"
"the  deceased 
in  the  hospital  and  was  able  to  monitor  the"
"deceased continuously as stated by PW4 in her evidence."
