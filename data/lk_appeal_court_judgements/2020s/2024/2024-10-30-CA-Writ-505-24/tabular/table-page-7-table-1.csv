"this submission cuts across her own pleadings whereby she pleads that the premises was"
"given to her and a request was made to give her the title. The request letters (X2 and X3)"
"the Petitioner is relying on does not mention the name of Hemapala at all. It is also pertinent"
"to note that the Petitioner concedes that she is in occupation of the corpus."
"T

"T
he Petitioner’s next relief prayed for in prayer (d) was objected to on the ground that it"
"was ambiguous. The said relief pleaded by the Petitioner is reproduced here. It commences"

"grievances  and  the  reliefs  that  she  is  praying  for.  The  Petitioner  cannot  plead  for  an"

"vague. In this instance, this Court is inclined to uphold the objection of the Respondents"

"In coming to this conclusion, this Court has considered the decision in, Amerasinghe and"
"Others v. Central Environmental Authority and Others CA/WRIT/132/2018, decided on"
"10.09.2020, where it  was held that  “A Petitioner invoking the  jurisdiction of this Court"
"must seek relief that would address their grievance and must not refer to each and every"
"section in an Act hoping and praying that his case would come under at least one of the"
"said sections. In other words, the relief that is sought must be specific and should address"
"the concerns of the Petitioner. This would then enable the Respondents to respond to the"
"averments of fact and law raised by the Petitioner. The fact that the relief is vague is an"
"indication that the Petitioner is unsure of the allegations that he/she is making against the"
"Respondents and makes the task of Court to mete out justice that much harder”"
