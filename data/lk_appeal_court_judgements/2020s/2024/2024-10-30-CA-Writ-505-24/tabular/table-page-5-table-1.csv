"Is the corpus State land?"
"As per the submissions of the Counsel, the first question the Petitioner wants this Court to"
"address is whether the corpus is State land. This is a matter that has to be decided through"
"evidence and  the  forum  to  do  so  is  not the Writ  Court.  However,  as  per  the  documents"
"submitted  and  the  submissions  made  by  the  Petitioner,  this  Court  observes  that  the"
"contention of the Petitioner is that she owns premises by virtue of X2 and X3. Let me now"
"consider  the  said  two  documents.  X2  is  a  document  dated  14.01.1992  and  is  a  letter"
"addressed to the  Provincial Land Commissioner by the then  Chief  Minister  whereby he"
"requested the possession of the premises to be transferred to the Petitioner. In the second"
"letter dated 06.04.1992, the Chief Minister of the North Central Province once again made"
"a  request  to  the  Provincial  Land  Commissioner  to  transfer  the  title  to  the  corpus  to  the"
"Petitioner. The learned State Counsel appearing for the Respondents objected to both letters"
"and challenged the authenticity of the said two documents, thus, making the contents of the"
"said two documents a disputed fact. It was the contention of the learned State Counsel that"
"no copies of the said documents are available in the main file and also the said letters are"
"not genuine."
