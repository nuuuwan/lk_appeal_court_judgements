"When the prosecutrix was cross-examined, it had been suggested to her that she"
"had consensual sex for over one and half hours with the appellant and after her"
"son came home and questioned about a cigarette packet found in the house, she"
"concocted a story against the appellant, which the prosecutrix has denied."
"It appears that the time of one and half hours and the questions relating to the"
"cigarette packet, has been gathered out of the evidence the prosecutrix to make"
"this suggestion, rather than as a basis for a defence of consent in this regard."
"I find that it may be the very reason why, when the appellant was called upon"
"for  his  defence,  he  has  not  taken  such  a  position  in  his  dock  statement.  The"
"position taken up the appellant in his dock statement had been that he had a"
"long-standing affair with the prosecutrix, a suggestion that has not been put to"
"her when she gave evidence."
"The dock statement of the appellant mainly revolves on the basis that, the son"
"of the prosecutrix who came to the country after working overseas, came to know"
"about the affair he had with the prosecutrix, and it was the son who has taken"
"her to the police and forced her to make a complaint like this."
"If  that  was  his  position,  the  relevant  person  to  whom  that  should  have  been"
"suggested was the son (PW-03), when he gave evidence at the trial. Other than"
"asking about a cigarette packet found in the house, no suggestion had been put"
"to the son stating that it was he who instigated this complaint, after he found"
"out about the appellantâ€™s affair with his mother."
"It is well settled law that, if an accused person is taking up a stand against the"
"evidence  placed  before  the  Court,  it  should  be  within  his  prerogative  to  put"
"across  that  position  to  the  relevant  witnesses  and  confront  them,  so  that  the"
"witnesses can respond to his stand."
