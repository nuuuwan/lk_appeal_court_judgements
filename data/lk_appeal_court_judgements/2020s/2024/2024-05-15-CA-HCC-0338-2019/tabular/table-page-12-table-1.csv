"(5) The Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial judge"
"with  regard  to  the  acceptance  or  rejection  of  testimony  of  a  witness"
"unless it is manifestly wrong."
"In the case of State of U.P. Vs. M. K. Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48, it was held:"
"“While appreciating the evidence of a witness the approach must be whether"
"the evidence of a witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth."
"Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the Court to"
"scrutinize the evidence more  particularly keeping in view the deficiencies,"
"drawbacks  and  infirmities  pointed  out  in  the  evidence  as  a  whole  and"
"evaluate  them  to  find  out  whether  it  is  against  the  general  tenor  of  the"
"evidence  given  by  the  witness  and  whether  the  earlier  evaluation  of  the"
"evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies"
"on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach"
"by  taking  sentences  torn  out  of  context  here  or  there  from  the  evidence,"
"attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating"
"officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection"
"of the evidence as a whole.”"
"It was contended further that, although the learned trial judge has considered"
"the defence of the appellant diligently, the learned High Court Judge has failed"
"to give the same attention to the prosecution’s version of events, which favoured"
"the appellant."
"However, I am not in a position to agree with such a contention. Although it was"
"argued on the basis that the defence taken up by the appellant was consent, I"
"am  unable  to  find  any  evidence  amounting  to  the  appellant  admitting  having"
"sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix on the day of the incident. For a person"
"to take up a defence of consent, he must first admit that sexual intercourse took"
"place on the day and at the time and at the place where the prosecutrix alleges"
"that the appellant had sexual intercourse with her against her will, and to take"
"up the defence that it happened with consent."
