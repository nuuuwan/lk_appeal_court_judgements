"In this process, he has threatened to smash the house if she did not open the"
"door. When she refused, he has come around the house to the back door and"
"had kicked the door. Since it was an old door, which had no lock but a wooden"
"cross-bar placed across it, the door had got opened when it was kicked."
"The appellant whom she identified as Ajith has entered the house from the back"
"door and has held the prosecutrix by her neck and forced her to go into a room"
"of the house. It was her evidence that after forcing her onto the bed in the room,"
"he lifted her  nightdress, partially removed his trouser and  had forcible sexual"
"intercourse with her. She has stated  that the incident lasted for about one and"
"half  hours.  It  appears  from  the  line  of  examination  by  the  Prosecuting  State"
"Counsel that, several questions have been put to the prosecutrix on the basis"
"that the incident lasted for about one and half hours."
"The Prosecuting State Counsel has put another question asking her whether she"
"felt some smell when she was raped, for which she has replied that she cannot"
"say, but there was a cigarette smell."
"The witness has stated that the appellant closed her mouth with his hand which"
"prevented her from shouting, but ultimately she was able to shout because of"
"the pain she suffered."
"After committing the act of forcible intercourse with her, the appellant has left,"
"stating, although he is leaving now, he is going to come back."
"Thereafter, through fear, the prosecutrix has gone to the house of her neighbour"
"who lived about 15 feet away from her house and stayed with the female who"
"occupied  that  house  until  her  son  returned.  After  going  there,  she  has  not"
"directly  divulged  the  rape  incident  to  her,  but  has  stated  Ajith,  meaning  the"
"appellant, forced her into the house and she feels pain and let her sleep in the"
"house. She has explained as to why she did not divulge the incident of rape to"
"her neighbor stating that she feared if she divulged it, she may not be allowed to"
"stay in that house."
