"It should be understood that for a female who faces an unexpected situation of"
"this kind, while alone in her own home, in the dead of the night, even 5 minutes"
"may feel like a long period. I am of the view that,  one and half hours mentioned"
"by the prosecutrix does not mean that it actually happened over such a period,"
"but it was how she has explained the situation faced by her."
"Although  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  invited  the  Court  to  consider  this"
"aspect together with the dock statement of the appellant, arguing that it creates"
"a doubt, I have no basis to agree."

"There is nothing to suggest that the cigarette packet was found by the son before"
"he took his mother to the hospital."
