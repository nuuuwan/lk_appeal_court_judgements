"taken up by the appellant was inconsistent and has not created any doubt as to"

"placed before it in its totality, be it the evidence of the prosecution, or that of the"
"defence, and come to a firm finding as to whether the prosecution has proved"
"the case against  the accused beyond reasonable doubt or not."
"In the Privy Council judgement in Jayasena Vs. Queen 72 NLR 313 (PC) it"
"was held:"
"“A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider"
"all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by"
"the  defence  in  its  totality  without  compartmentalizing  and,  ask  himself"
