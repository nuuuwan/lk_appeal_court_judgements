"The  normal  human  behaviour  would  be  to  abandon  her  in  a  lonely  spot  or"
"where the offence was committed, and move away from the place of the offence"
"in  order  to  cover  their  tracks.  Especially,  if  they  made  her  unconscious  and"
"committed this offence on her, they would have easily left after committing the"
"act, leaving the prosecutrix to fend for herself."
"The way the police officer who made the arrest had arrested the appellant and"
"the other person shows that the two of them had not fled the area or attempted"
"to  cover  up  any  crime,  since  they  have  been  arrested  in  the  vicinity  of  the"
"checkpoint while being on the same three-wheeler. I find that all these factual"
"matters  require  looking  for  some  kind  of  corroboration  as  to  the  version  of"
"events by the prosecutrix if the trial Court is to act on her evidence alone."
"On  the  question  of  requiring  corroboration,  Glanville  Williams  in  his  book"
"Proof of Guilt 3rd Edition at page 58 and 59 states as follows."
