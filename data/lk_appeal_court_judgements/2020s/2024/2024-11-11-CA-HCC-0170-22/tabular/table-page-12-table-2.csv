"On  the  question  of  requiring  corroboration,  Glanville  Williams  in  his  book",""
"Proof of Guilt 3rd Edition at page 58 and 59 states as follows.",""
"","“On a charge of rape and similar offences, it is the practice to instruct the"
"","jury  that  it  is  unsafe  to  convict  on  the  uncorroborated  evidence  of  the"
"","alleged  victim.  The  rule  applies  to  a  charge  of  indecent  assault,  or  any"
"","sexual offence, including  an unnatural offence between males. There  is  a"
"","sound  reason  for  it,  because  these  cases  are  particularly  subject  to  the"
"danger  of  deliberately","false  charges, 
resulting 
from  sexual  neurosis,"
"phantasy,","jealousy,  spite  or  simply  a  girl’s  refusal  to  admit  that  she"
"consented to an act of which she is now ashamed.”",""
