"According to the version of events as described by the prosecutrix, there cannot"
"be any eyewitnesses to the incident. Therefore, it is necessary for the Court to"
"consider  whether  her  evidence  is  cogent  enough  to  be  accepted  without  any"
"corroboration in that regard."
"It  is  an  accepted  fact  that  a  person  who  is  committing  a  crime  of  this  nature"
"would make sure no one will notice his actions, unless it happens by chance. It"
"is therefore necessary to consider whether the version of events as narrated by"
"the  prosecutrix  is  probable  under  the  circumstances  relating  to  the  offence"
"committed."
"In her evidence, the prosecutrix has admitted that after she got down from the"
"bus,  she  went  to  the  Mohan’s  shop,  although  she  has  claimed  that  she"
"changed her mind and returned. The evidence of the appellant had been to the"
"effect that she in fact came to the Mohan’s shop where he worked and the 2nd"
"accused also came there, and all of them had ice-cream together before leaving"
"the place in the three-wheeler belonging to the 2nd accused."
"Under the circumstances, it is necessary to consider whether the prosecutrix’s"
"claim  that  she  was  taken  into  the  three-wheeler  forcibly  by  the  appellant  and"
"the  other  person  can  in  itself  be  cogent  enough  to  be  believed.  She  has  also"
"claimed that when she was taken into the three-wheeler, they covered her face"
"with a shawl which made her unconscious."
"However, this version of events by the prosecutrix can also be construed as an"
"attempt  to  show  that  she  had  no  connection  whatsoever  with  the  accused"
"persons  in  order  to  cover  up  what  may  have  actually  happened.  As  correctly"
"pointed  out  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant,  the  evidence  of  the"
"appellant has not been contradicted to conclude that he is uttering falsehood in"
"order to put the blame on the 2nd accused."
