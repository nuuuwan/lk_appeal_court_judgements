"part of the record."
"The respondents draw the attention of this Court to the following case law which supports the"
"position that objections raised by relying on rules are mere technical objections and all parties"
"deserve a full hearing where they are allowed to state their respective cases before Court."
"In Union Apparels (Pvt) Ltd. Vs. Director General of Customs 2000-1 SLR 27, it had been held"
