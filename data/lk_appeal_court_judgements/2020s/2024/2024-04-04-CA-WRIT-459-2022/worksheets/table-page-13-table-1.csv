"As  such,  it  is  evident  that  the  petitioner  had  failed  to  act  promptly  and  that  it  had  faced"
"repercussions of its own delay."
"In the case of Mendis Vs. Land Reform Commission and Others, [S.C. Appeal No. 90/2009, SC"
"Minutes dated 12.02.2016], Gooneratne J held thus:"
"""Even  if  such  grounds  to  issue  a  writ  of  certiorari  and  mandamus  could  be"
"established, court has also to consider whether the petitioners are disentitled to"
"the relief prayed for even if the grounds of issuing a writ are satisfied, due to the"
"discretionary nature of the remedy."""
"This Court's attention is also drawn to what has been held in the case of Jayawardena vs."
"People's Bank 2002 3SLR 17:"
"â€œCourts  will  always  be  ready  and  willing  to  apply  the  constitutional  remedy  of"
"mandamus in the appropriate case. The appropriate case must necessarily be a"
"situation where there is a public duty."""
"It is submitted on behalf of the respondents that there is no public duty on the part of these"
"respondents to allow the petitioner to import whole milk powder in violation of the payment"
"terms available in the relevant gazette notifications."
"Moreover, the petitioner has failed to establish a legal right in order to be entitled to the relief"
"that had been sought and the petitioner has failed to take immediate steps in adherence to"
"the provisions of the relevant gazettes disentitling him from obtaining discretionary remedy."
"In Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka vs M/S Jafferjee and Jafferjee (Pvt) Limited 2005"
"1SLR Pg.89 it was reiterated that,"
"""the foundation of mandamus is the existence of a legal right. A court should not"
"grant a writ of mandamus to enforce a right which is not legal and not based upon"
"a public duty."""
"The  petitioner  has  filed  the  amended  petition  dated  16.12.2022  seeking 
inter  alia  the"
"following reliefs."
"a) 
Issue notice on the respondents."
"b) 
Call  for  the  entire  record  pertaining  to  the  subject  matter  of  this  case  from"
"1st,2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents."
