"respondent, before 20th October 2022, the date the vessel bearing the consignment"
"arriving in Sri Lanka, notwithstanding every possible endeavor by the petitioner to do"
"so; a fact made known to the 1st respondent.'"
"Accordingly, the respondents argued that the goods had been imported in violation of the"
"regulations   made under S.4(1) of Import and Export Control Act. Therefore, the goods fall"
"within schedule B of the Customs Ordinance.  Clause 7 of the regulations (P 7) provide that"
"the Director General of Customs shall act in accordance with the provisions of the Customs"
"Ordinance on any importation made in violation of the above regulations."
"Clause 7 also provides for the Director General Custom to consult the Controller in the event"
"of a violation of clause 4(c). The petitioner seeks to quash the decision of the 1st respondent"
"not to issue the letter of authorization. The 1st respondent (The Controller General of Imports"
"and  Exports)  was  precluded  by  the  terms  of  the  regulation  4(c)  from  issuing  a  letter  of"
"authorization after the goods were imported. The recommendation by the Secretary Ministry"
"of  Industries  was  submitted  by  the  petitioner  to  the  1st  respondent  only  after  the  goods"
"arrived  in  Sri  Lanka.  Therefore,  that  1st  respondent  had  no  discretion  to  issue  a  letter  of"
"authorization."
"If the 1st respondent had done so, the 1st respondent would be acting contrary to regulation"
"4(c),  since  the  regulations  do  not  give  the  1st  respondent  any  power  to  issue  a  letter  of"
"authorization after the vessel arrives in a port of Sri Lanka."
"Thereafter, as set out in paragraph 34 and 35 of the petition the Director General Customs"
"initiated on an inquiry in relation to the importation of the consignment. The said inquiry was"
"conducted and a mitigated forfeiture under S. 12, 43 and 163 was imposed on the petitioner."
"The  petitioner  was  thereafter  permitted  to  clear  the  goods  subject  to  a  bank  guarantee"
"pending the decision of the Minister of Finance under sections 163 and 164 of the Customs"
"Ordinance."
"In terms of section 163 and section 164, the petitioner has an alternative statutory remedy."
"That  is,  an  appeal  to  the  Minister.  This  has  not  been  exhausted.  The  learned  President's"
"Counsel for the respondents argued that these facts have been suppressed from this Court."
"The  petitioner  has  instead  provided  an  evasive  response.  In  paragraphs  15  and  16  of  the"
"affidavit of the 2nd respondent it is stated in substance as follows:"
