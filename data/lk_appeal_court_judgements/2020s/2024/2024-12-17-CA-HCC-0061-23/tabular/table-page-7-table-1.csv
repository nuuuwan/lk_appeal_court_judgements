"embarrassing descriptions of events and acts one cannot expect"
"in  the  backdrop  of  our  culture,  society  and  social  norms,  to"

"violence  will  be  naturally  inclined  to  say  what  is  necessary  and"
"only the bare minimum. This is especially so when a victim had"
"been traumatized by such event."
