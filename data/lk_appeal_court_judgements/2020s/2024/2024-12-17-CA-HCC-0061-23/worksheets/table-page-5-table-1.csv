"That  being  so,  the  argument  advanced  is  that  PW-01’s"
"version of how the appellant escaped is improbable. PW-01"
"states that the appellant stepped on to the ironing board,"
"scaled the wall, jumped to the sitting area, and escaped. It"
"is submitted that the Police witness said that the height of"
"the wall was approximately 14 ½ feet, and the Police Officer"
"also had not observed any footprints on the wall. It is thus"
"submitted that even if the ironing board is 3 feet tall, it is"
"not possible for a person to scale a wall of 14 ½ feet. Even"
"if  he  had  done  so,  one  would  expect  some  injury  to  have"
"been caused to the appellant if he leaped 14 ½ feet. Thus,"
"it is the submission that the version of PW-01 is improbable"
"and that this had escaped the attention of the trial judge."
