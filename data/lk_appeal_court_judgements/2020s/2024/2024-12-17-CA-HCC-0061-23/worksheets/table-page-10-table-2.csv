"22. I  regret 
to  note","that 
the  appellant  has  resorted 
to  raising"
"","extremely trivial differences and omissions to assail and challenge"
"","the  evidence  of  PW-01.  As  held  time  and  again,  evidence  of"
"witnesses","is  susceptible  to  variations  due  to  natural  human"
"frailties 
of 
loss","of  memory 
and 
lapse 
of 
time. 
In 
such"
"circumstances,  when","such 
differences 
and 
omissions 
are"
"","insignificant and especially when the ‘probabilities factor’ echoes"
"","in favour of the version narrated by the witnesses as in this case"
"","the court can act on such evidence. As to the contradictions and"
"","omissions, which I have already considered, they are broadly two"
"","omissions  and  one  contradiction.  At  pages  16  and  23  of  the"
"judgement, 
these","contradictions 
and 
omissions  have  been"
"","sufficiently considered. To that extent, the learned trial judge has"
"","adverted his mind to the same. Accordingly, as for this ground of"
"appeal, I see no merit and the same is thus rejected.",""
