filed  a  private 
information  under  the  Provisions  of"
"","Section 66 Primary Courts’ Procedure Act."
"6)","However,  as  per  Petitioners 
the  Learned  Magistrate  had 
failed 
to"
"","consider the facts pertinent to this action and had decided to grant the"
"","possession to the Respondent."
"7)","Aggrieved  by  the  said  decision,  the  Petitioners  had 
filed  a  revision"
"","application before the Provincial High Court of Badulla and Petitioners"
"","contended  that  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  erred  and/or  had"
"","misdirected  in  Law  and  had  failed  to  appreciate  the  facts  pertinent  to"
"","the matter in dispute and dismissed the Petitioners’ application."

"","by 
the  Petitioners 
to  obtain 
the  reliefs  prayed 
for 
in 
the  revision"
"","application dated 8th September 2022."
"9)","In their statement of objections, the Respondents have rejected the said"
"","facts  related  to  the  petition  and  contended  that  the  Petitioners  have"
"","suppressed material facts and misrepresented facts to court."
"10)","Further,  the  Petitioners  have  failed  to  demonstrate  the  existence  of"
"","exceptional  circumstances  that  would  warrant  the  invocation  of  the"
"","revisionary jurisdiction of this court."

the  Respondents  were  wrongfully  dispossessed  by 
the"
"","Petitioners."
"12)","The  Learned  Magistrate  appropriately  evaluated  the  facts  and  relevant"
"","documents, 
leading  to  the  rightful  restoration  of  possession  to  the"
"","Respondents.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  also  upheld  the  said"
"","Judgement."
"13)","Therefore,  the  Respondents  have  prayed  that  the  application  made  by"
"","the Petitioners should be dismissed."
