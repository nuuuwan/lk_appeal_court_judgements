"23)","The permit holder, Abdul Wahid, the father of the 1st Petitioner and the"
"","Respondent had demised on 15th June 2004.  The death certificate had"
"","been produced at the Magistrate Courts as 1B2."
"24)","The argument put forward by the Petitioners’ counsel is that in the said"
"","permit, Abdul Wahid had nominated his son Abdul Wahidu Jailabdeen,"
"","the 1st Petitioner as the nominee."
"25)","However,  after  the  demise  of  Abdul  Wahid  in  the  year  2004,  the  1st"
"","Petitioner had not taken any steps to obtain a valid permit in his name"
"","as the nominee."
"26)","Therefore, given that 10 years have passed with respect of the title, it is"
"","submitted that the decision should be taken by the Divisional Secretary"
"","who  is  entitled  to  determine  the  rightful  ownership  of  the  disputed"
"","land."
"27)","Thus,  this  is  a  separate  matter  to  be  decided  in  a  different  forum."
"","Beside  these  issues,  the  Learned  Magistrate  noted  that,  prior  to  the"
"","incident; the Respondents had been in possession of the property for a"
"","period  of  two  months.  This  fact  was  corroborated  by  Plan  No.  4538,"
"","dated  5th  June  2003,  on  which  the  Respondents  and  Petitioners  had"
"","divided 
their 
respective 
lots  and  had  been 
in  occupation 
for  an"
"","extended period."
"28)","It 
is 
important  to  note  that  under  the  Primary  Courts’  Procedure,"
"","Section  66  provides  only  a  temporary  measure  to  preserve  the  status"
"","the  parties.  The  rights  of 
the  parties,  based  on 
the 
quo  between"
"","available  evidence,  should  ultimately  be  determined  by  the  Divisional"
"","Secretary, as the property in question belongs to the State."
"29)","The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  correctly  considered  the  Order"
"","made  by  the  Magistrate  and  had  decided  that  the  Learned  Magistrate"
"","had correctly evaluated the facts and the documents and there was no"
"","legal  ground  to  revise  the  said  Order  under  Revisionary  Jurisdiction"
