"T
he appellant says that he took a part of the 1% and the Rs.15,000/-. If"
"the appellant asked the amount of Rs.30.000/- to recover the 1% due to"
"the Agrarian Service Committee and to get back the purported loan given"
"by  him,  why  he  demanded  and  accepted  only  a  part  of  the  1%?  This  is"
"indeed  unusual  and  unacceptable  defence.  According  to  the  evidence  of"
"the  case,  there  was  no  procedure  to  demand  and  accept  separately  the"
"said 1% from the due amount. The said 1% should be given by the society"
"to the Agrarian Service Committee from the 5% that the society retained."
"Anyhow, it is amply clear that there is absolutely no way to recover only a"
"part payment from the 1%."
