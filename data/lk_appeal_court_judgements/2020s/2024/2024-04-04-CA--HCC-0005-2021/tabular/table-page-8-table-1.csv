"apparent from the document P-3 that the appellant had given the approval"
"to encash the cheque after receiving the Rs. 30,000/-. Even the appellant"
"stated in his evidence that he endorsed the approval in P-3. If money is"
"taken from a person in performing an official duty, the first thing that the"
"officer should do is to issue a receipt for the money taken. After issuing a"
"receipt for the money that the complainant gave, the appellant should have"
"given the approval. The appellant did not issue a receipt but did give his"
"approval. Therefore, I agree with the contention of the learned DSG that it"
"is apparent that the appellant had time to issue a receipt before the arrest"
"if he wanted to issue a receipt but he did not. Not issuing a receipt is also"
"a reason to conclude that Rs.30,000/- was taken not as a part of 1% and"
"the loan but as a bribe."
