"Although PW1 said that the raid was a routine exercise, he admitted that he"
"knew the Appellant previously as “Batti” and her house location. I too agree"
"with  the  Learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  that  the  Learned  High  Court"
"Judge should have considered this portion of evidence when he analysed the"
"evidence of the defence."
"The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed by the"
"prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding."
