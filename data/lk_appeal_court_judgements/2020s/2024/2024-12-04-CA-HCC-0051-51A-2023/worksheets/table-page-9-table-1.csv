"17. According  to  which  the  Court  of  Appeal  is  vested  with  a  discretion  to"
"consider the time spent in remand pending the appeal as well as time"
"spent in custody prior to the conviction as being a part of the sentence"
"ordered."
"18. On the perusal of the record and the brief, I am unable to ascertain the"
"pre conviction periods of remand of the appellants. However, upon the"
"conviction the appellants have been in remand for one year, ten months"
"and  seventeen  days  up  until  today.  Accordingly,  I  would  consider  a"
"period of two years  as being the period in custody both pre and post-"
"conviction. Accordingly, said period of two years will be considered as a"
"part of the sentence which will be given credit to. Accordingly, the final"
"aggregate sentences of each of the accused-appellants will be two years"
"rigorous imprisonment."
"19. Accordingly, the appeals are partially allowed."
