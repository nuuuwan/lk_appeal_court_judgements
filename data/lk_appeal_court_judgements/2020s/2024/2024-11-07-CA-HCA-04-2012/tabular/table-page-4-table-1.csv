n  22nd  of  February  2013, 
the  Court  of  Appeal  referred 
this  application 
to 
the  Chief"
"Magistrate in Colombo for an inquiry and a report regarding the arrest and alleged detention"
"in question. The Chief Magistrate conducted an inquiry and submitted findings to the Court"

"abduction has been confirmed and that the Police have not conducted a proper investigation"

"U
pon  review  of  the  materials  before  us,  it  is  clear  that  the  identity  card  numbers  and"
"photographs of the individuals in question were obtained from the Police when handing them"

"have  also  neglected  to  present  the  suspected  individuals  before  a  Magistrate  as  required  by"
"law. Instead, the police have simply transferred the custody of these individuals to the Army,"
"citing their status as Army officers, without any further legal process or even an investigation."
