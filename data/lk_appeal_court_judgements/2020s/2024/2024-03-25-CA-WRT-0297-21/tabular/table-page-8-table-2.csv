"The  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  who  appeared  on  behalf  of  the  5A  Respondent"
"submitted that the recommendations sought to be quashed by the Petitioner has not been"
"acted upon by His Excellency the President and there are no legally binding and operative"
"recommendations to be quashed. Therefore, the issuance of Writ of Certiorari as prayed for"
"by the Petitioner in this application is futile. The learned Additional Solicitor General suggests"
"to terminate the proceedings with liberty for the Petitioner to re agitate this matter if the"
"need arises."
