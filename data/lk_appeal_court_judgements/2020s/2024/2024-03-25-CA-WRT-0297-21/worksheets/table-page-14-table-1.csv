"National School and Other [2004] 1 SLR 346, 349 Justice Sripavan (as he then was) stated that;"
"""it  is  of  fundamental  importance  that  justice  should  not  only  be  done,  but  should"
"manifestly  and  undoubtedly  be  seen  to  be  done.  The  law  is  concerned  with  public"
"confidence in the administration of justice; hence it is of paramount importance to"
"ensure that individuals fee that they have been given a fair hearing before a decision"
"is taken. """
