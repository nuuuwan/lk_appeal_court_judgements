"services  of  the  above  employees  were  terminated  without  their  prior  consent  in"
"writing or without the prior approval of the Commissioner General of Labour. As it is"
"not prudent to reinstate the employees in the Petitioner Company due to the nature"
"of  the  dispute,  the  2nd  Respondent  has  recommended  that  compensation  be"
"awarded 
to  3rd-7th  Respondents.  The  said 
recommendations 
(1R1)  had  been"
"communicated  to  the  1st  Respondent.  Accordingly,  the  1st  Respondent  issued  the"
"Order dated 10.07.2021 marked P3 awarding the 3rd to 7th Respondents a sum of Rs."
"969,540.00 for the relevant wrongful termination of services by the Petitioner. Thus,"
"the Respondents claim that the Application of the Petitioner should be dismissed."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  has  indicated  his  willingness  to  proceed"
"against only the 1st & 2nd Respondents at the commencement of the application."
"The Petitioner states that while the Petitioner was intending to hold a disciplinary"
"inquiry against the 3rd to 7th   Respondents regarding the impugned incident, the 3rd"
"to 7th Respondents proceeded to make complaints to the 1st Respondent allegedly in"
"terms of the provisions of the TEWA on the basis that the Petitioner has terminated"
"their  services.  The  Petitioner  denies  such  termination  of  service  of  the  3rd  to  7th"
"Respondents.  However,  upon  an  inquiry,  the  1st  Respondent  had  held  that  the"
"Petitioner has terminated the services of the 3rd to 7th Respondent in contrary to the"
"provisions of TEWA. As the Petitioner denies the termination of employment, it is"
"crucial  to  ascertain  if  the  1st  Respondent  could  have  exercised  any  of  his  powers"
"under TEWA in respect of the given incident."
"Section  6  of 
the  TEWA  stipulated 
that  where  an  employer 
terminates 
the"
"employment  of  a  workman 
in  contravention  of  the  provisions  of  this  Act,  the"
"Commissioner may order such employer to continue to employ the workman, with"
"effect from a date specified in such order, in the same capacity in which the workman"
"was employed prior to such termination. However, the provisions under TEWA do"
"not apply in respect of every category of termination of employment. It only applies"
"in  respect  of 
termination  of  services  other  than  voluntary  terminations  and"
"terminations  on  disciplinary  grounds.  As  per  Section  2(4)  of  the  TEWA, 
the"
"employment of any workman shall be deemed to be terminated, for the purpose of"
"the Act, if for any reason whatsoever, otherwise than by reason of a  punishment"
"imposed by way of disciplinary action. The Section 2(4) of the TEWA is as follows."
