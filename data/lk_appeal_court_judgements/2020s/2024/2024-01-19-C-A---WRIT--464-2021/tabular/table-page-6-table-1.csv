"to take disciplinary actions against the 3rd to 7th Respondents until the Petitioner has"
"taken up that stand at the inquiry before the 2nd Respondent. No evidence has been"
"produced  before  the  2nd  Respondent  to  substantiate  such  a  position  that  the"
"Petitioner  had  the  intention  to  take  any disciplinary  actions  against  the  3rd  to  7th"
"Respondents.  It  appears  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  notify  the  3rd  to  7th"
"Respondents of its intention to take disciplinary actions. No charge sheet had been"
"served against them. Even the Human Resource Manager of the Petitioner Company"
"who had provided a statement to the Police on 20.09.2018 had not indicated any"
"intention of the Petitioner Company to take disciplinary actions against the 3rd to 7th"
"Respondents.  A  mere  statement,  not  substantiated  with  any  evidence,  shall  not"
"prove the alleged intention of the Petitioner Company that the Petitioner Company"
"was in the process of taking disciplinary actions against the 3rd to 7th Respondents."
"It  is  noteworthy  the  period  of  time  taken  by  the  Petitioner  even  to  express  an"
"intention of conducting an inquiry against the 3rd to 7th Respondents and further such"
"intimation was made only at the later part of the inquiry before the 2nd Respondent."
"It appears that there was no reason for the 3rd to 7th Respondents to believe that"
"the Petitioner was intending to take disciplinary actions against them.  Therefore,"
"the assertion of the 3rd to 7th Respondents that the Petitioner Company terminated"
"their services by preventing them from reporting to work without any reason and"
"on non-disciplinary grounds cannot be denied. Accordingly, the application made by"
"the 3rd to 7th Respondents to the 1st Respondent cannot be considered a premature"
"application or that it is contrary to the provisions of TEWA."
"Since there was no disciplinary action taken against the 3rd to 7th   Respondents by"
"the  Petitioner,  the  termination  of  their  services  by  the  Petitioner  cannot  be"
"considered as a termination on disciplinary grounds. Therefore, the applicability of"
"TEWA in respect of the termination of services of the 3rd to 7th Respondents cannot"
"be denied while the 1st Respondent cannot be  ousted from exercising the power"
"vested upon him under TEWA."
"The Petitioner further claims that the 1st and 2nd Respondent could have made an"
"Order directing the Petitioner Company to hold a disciplinary inquiry with regard to"
"the incident on the very first day of the inquiry. Nevertheless, upon perusal of the"
"proceedings  of  the  inquiry  before  the  2nd  Respondent  and  the  material  placed"
"before this Court, it is evident that the Petitioner has not taken up any such stand or"
"made  a  request  in  that  respect  at  the  initial  stage  of  the  inquiry  before  the  2nd"
