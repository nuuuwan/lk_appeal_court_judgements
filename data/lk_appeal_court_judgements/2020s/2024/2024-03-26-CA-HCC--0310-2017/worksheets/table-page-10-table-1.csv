"During the argument the Counsel for the Appellant vehemently contended"
"that the prosecution had failed to prove that the mobile phone and the dialog"
"number 0775759708 had been used by the deceased Wimal Malaviarchchi."

"to  an  acceptance  of  that  testimony  by  the  party  whom  the  evidence  is"
"adduced."
