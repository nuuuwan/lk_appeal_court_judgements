"","Accordingly, this ground of appeal has no merit."
"34.","It was submitted that PW-01 the Pathologist is not competent to express"
"","an  opinion  as  to  the  distances  of  the  firing  and  it  is  the  preview  of  a"
"","forensic ballistics expert, or a firearms examiner and the trial judge erred"
"","when she considered the opinion of the Pathologist as to the distances."
"","The  doctor  confirms  that  the  deceased  had  two  injuries  caused  by  two"
"","gunshots fired at him. One, in the abdomen area, and the second on the"
"","back of the leg. Based on the spread of pellets penetrating the body, the"
"","doctor  had  expressed  an  opinion  that  this  shot  had  been  fired  from  a"
"","distance and possibly when the deceased was on a standing position. As"
"","for  the  second  injury  on  the  back  of  the  leg,  which  had  been  an  injury"
"","which had broken through the skin and bone, was also identified to be a"
"","gunshot  injury  probably  by  a  shotgun  and  fired  at  a  close  range.  Then"
"","expressed an opinion as to the probable distances based on the nature of"
"","these injuries. It is this last item with the probable disenchant which the"
"","pathologist is not competent to express an opinion."
