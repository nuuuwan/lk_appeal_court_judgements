"Then the shooting takes place, and thereafter, the 3rd accused was also"
"seen  leaving  on  a  bicycle  with  the  4th  accused,  with  the  1st  and  2nd"
"accused on another bicycle. Therefore, the 3rd accused, apart from being"
"seen  moving  with  the  1st  accused,  was  instrumental  in  bringing  the"
"firearm when the 1st and 2nd accused were in hot pursuit of the deceased,"
"so to speak. On the analysis of these items of evidence, cumulatively, the"
"only reasonable and probable inference is that the 3rd accused was acting"
"with a common murderous intention with the 1st accused.  What other"
"inference could be drawn when a person hands over a firearm in the heat"
"of the pursuit by the 1st accused? Therefore, there is sufficient evidence"
"to establish that the 3rd accused was acting together with the 1st accused,"
"sharing  a  common  murderous  intention.  The  learned  trail  judge  has"
"considered  these  items  of  evidence,  and  correctly  concluded  as  to  the"
"existence and entertaining of the common murderous intention between"
"and  amongst  the  3rd,  1st,  and  2nd  accused  persons.  Accordingly,  these"
"grounds of appeal on common intention are misconceived."
