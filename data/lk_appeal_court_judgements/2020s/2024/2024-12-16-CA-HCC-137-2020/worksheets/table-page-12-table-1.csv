"19.  In Jagathsena vs.  Bandaranayake  [(1984) 2 Sri  LR 39]  Colin-Thome"
"J.,  held  that  when  considering  contradictions 
inter  se  between  the"
"testimony  of 
two  witnesses 
the 
trial 
judge  should  consider 
if 
the"
"discrepancy was due to dishonesty or to defective memory or whether the"
"witness' powers of observations were limited."
"20.  By  any  standard,  the 
lapse  of  sixteen  years 
is  considerable  and"
"significant. 
It 
is  natural  and  quite  normal 
that 
it  can  affect 
the"
"recollection of events witnessed by any person. PW-13 Dinesh Kumara"
"in cross examination admits that if he had not referred to the 2nd accused"
"previously  it  may  be  correct  and  that  he  cannot  remember  if  the  2nd"
"accused  came.  This  witness  had  seen  several  events  during 
that"
"morning, where the 1st, 2nd and 3rd accused along with the 4th accused"
"were present, arriving with the gun as well as leaving on two bicycles. In"
"such circumstances, it is quite probable and natural for this witness to"
"have made a mistake of this nature after 16 years due to faulty memory."
"It is more probable than not the discrepancy was due to dishonesty but"
"due  to  defective  memory  and  the  witness'  powers  of  observation  being"
"limited. PW-13 Dinesh Kumara is a chance witness who happens to be"
"present at a crime scene by coincidence and may also be considered a"
"disinterested  witness  as  he  has  no  has  no  personal  interest  in  the"
"outcome of a case. To my mind his evidence read as a whole appears to"
"have a ring of truth. Thus, this discrepancy does not affect the credibility"
"of the totality of the prosecution evidence."
"21.  Next  inconsistency  alleged  is  the  inter  se  contradiction  between  the"
"evidence  of 
the  Police 
Investigator  PW-15 
IP  Mettananda  and 
the"
"eyewitness PW-13 Dinesh Kumara, where PW-13 Dinesh Kumara states"
"that  two  shots  were  fired  but  IP  Mettananda  had  recovered  only  one"
"empty  cartridge.  This  was  highlighted  as  a  contradiction  or  a  matter"
