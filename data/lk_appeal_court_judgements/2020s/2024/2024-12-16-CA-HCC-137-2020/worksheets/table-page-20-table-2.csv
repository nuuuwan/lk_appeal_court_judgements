"pathologist is not competent to express an opinion."
"35.  However,  PW-14,  the  Investigating  Officer  observed  the  scene  and"
"identified  that  a  shot  had  been  fired  through  a  window.  In  view  of  the"
"damage  observed  around  the  windowpane.  Then,  he  has  observed  the"
"place where the deceased had fallen, to be the other end of the said house"
"and clearly has observed that the said place is visible and is in direct view"
"from  the  window  that  was  also  damaged.  He  had  given  the  distance"
"between the window and the place where the deceased had fallen. Thus,"
"even in the absence of the Pathologist’s evidence as to the distances there"
"is other evidence to corroborate PW-13 ‘s’ evidence as to the distance. As"
"such this has not caused any prejudice or resulted in any miscarriage of"
"justice."
