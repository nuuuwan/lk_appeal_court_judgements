"charges against the appellant had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. I am"
"of the view that it is not safe to convict the appellant on such evidence."
"Therefore, it is my considered view that the conviction of the appellant based on"
"the  circumstantial  evidence  available  against  him  cannot  be  allowed  to  stand"
"and the grounds of appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant has"
"merit."
"Accordingly, I set aside the conviction and the sentence of the appellant by the"
"learned High Court Judge of Panadura and acquit him from the 1st and the 2nd"
"counts for which he was found guilty."
