(hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  appellant)  had  been"
"indicted  for  committing  the  murder  of  his  wife  along  with  his  mother.  At  the"
"conclusion  of  the  trial  both  accused  had  been  convicted  for  murder  and  the"
"mother of the appellant who had been the 1st accused at the trial had died in"
"prison."
"The  main  ground  of  appeal  raised  by  the  Counsel  for  the  appellant  was  that,"
"the trial judge had not considered the dying declaration properly and the case"
"for the prosecution had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt."
"The  prosecution  evidence  is  mainly  based  on  three  dying  declarations  the"
"deceased is supposed to have made."
"The  main  witness  for  the  prosecution  had  been  the  father  of  the  victim,  who"
"had said in evidence that the deceased at the time of the incident had been 19"
"years of age and she had been married to the appellant and had been living in"
"the house of the appellant and the 1st accused."
