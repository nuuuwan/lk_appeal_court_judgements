"but Somapala had taken the sword and had cut the deceased. At this point, the"
"appellant had taken a knife from the back of his shirt and had told everybody not to"
"move, but witness Nilmini had tried to flee and the appellant had given chase and"
"Nilmini had fallen into an abandoned well. This witness had been thoroughly cross"
"examined, but it appears to be that she had stood the test of cross examination quite"
"satisfactorily. Thereafter, prosecution had lead PW-02, who had corroborated PW-01"
"and had said that the deceased-accused, namely Somapala, had cut the deceased"
"while the appellant gave chase to witness Nilmini with a knife. In cross examination,"
"this witness had admitted that Somapala and the appellant came to the scene of crime"
"together."
"Thereafter, the prosecution had led the evidence of PW-04, who is the daughter of the"
"deceased, had said that at the time of the incident, she had been in a neighbouring"
"house but she saw Somapala and the appellant, leaving the scene of the crime"
"together."
"All the lay witnesses and investigative officers had observed that there was sufficient"
"illumination at the scene of the crime and the police had recovered a knife subsequent"
"to the statement of the appellant."
"At the closure of the prosecution case, the defence had been called and the appellant"
"had made a statement from the Dock, according to which he had admitted going to the"
"scene, giving chase to PW-01, but had denied sharing a common murderous intention"
"with Somapala. His position is that, cutting of the deceased took place while he was"
"giving chase to witness No.02."
"Defence had called a witness and he had corroborated the story for the prosecutor."
"In the light of the above mentioned evidence, the first ground of appeal raised by the"
"learned counsel for the appellant is that the trial judge had usurped the role of the"
"prosecution."
"The learned counsel for the appellant drew the attention of the court to page 212 of"
"the appeal brief, in which he alleges that the defence witness was led in the absence of"
"a state counsel. But this court observes that the defence witness had been led at the"
"request of the appellant and only the examination in chief had taken place and the"
"cross examination had been postponed to another date. The trial judge has not asked"
"a single question. The cross examination had in fact taken place after two months,"
"therefore the Attorney General had plenty of time to study the examination in chief"
"and cross examine the witness. Therefore, the absence of the state counsel has not"
"caused any prejudice to either party, but we note that the Attorney general has also"
"not objected to the proceedings in pg.212 on a subsequent date. The counsel for the"
"appellant submitted a lengthy written submission on this and has quoted many Indian"
"judgements."
