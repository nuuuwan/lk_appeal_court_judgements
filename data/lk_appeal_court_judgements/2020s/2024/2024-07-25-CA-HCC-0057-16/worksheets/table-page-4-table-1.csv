"But in the instant matter we observe that, for the reasons stated above that none of"
"the prejudice cited in the judgments submitted by the appellant had taken place in the"
"instant case. Therefore, we see no merit in the first ground of appeal."
"The second ground of appeal raised by the counsel for the appellant was that the"
"appellant did not share a common murderous intention with Somapala."
"But upon perusing the above mentioned evidence, the appellant had walked into the"
"scene of crime with a knife hidden inside his shirt and the deceased Somapala had"
"followed soon afterwards. Prior to this, the appellant had come to the scene of crime to"
"visit his mother and he had been drunk and turned back and sent by witness Nilmini"
"and the deceased. The appellant has supposed to have said, brandishing his knife, for"
"everybody to be in the places they were, which the defence had challenged with a"
"contradiction which the trial judge had overruled. The appellant had left the scene"
"with the dead Somapala and the appellant has always had a bad relationship with"
"witness Nilmini."
"All these items of evidence against the appellant had been considered thoroughly by"
"the trial judge in his judgement. The appellant in his dock statement had tried to show"
"that at the time Somapala was stabbing the deceased, he was giving chase to witness"
"Nilmini. But this line of defence had not been taken up during the cross examination"
"of the witnesses, therefore the trial judge had rejected the dock statement. The defence"
"witness had also spoken in line with the prosecution witnesses. Therefore, in view of"
"the above mentioned evidence, it cannot be held that the appellant did not share the"
"common murderous intention with the deceased Somapala."
"At this point the court draws its attention to the case of The King v Asappu et al"
"(1948) 50 NLR 324 at 329, Justice Dias stated that, “there must be evidence, direct"
"or circumstantial, either of a pre-arranged plan or a declaration showing common"
"intention , or some other significant fact at the time of the commission of the offence"
"to enable them to say that a co-accused had a common intention with the doer of the"
"act, and not merely a same or similar intention entertained independently of each"
"other.”"
"In the case of The Queen v J Mahatun (1959) 61 NLR 540 at 546, former Chief"
"Justice Basnayake stated that in order to prove the existence of common intention, it"
"is not essential to prove that the criminal act was done pursuant to a pre-arranged"
"plan. Common intention can come into existence at the spur of the moment."
"Therefore, we see no merit in the second grounds as well."
"The third ground of appeal is the allegation that the trial judge had not considered the"
"contradiction in the evidence of the prosecution. But we observe that the trial judge"
"has considered v1-v4 in the relevant portions of evidence in the prosecution very"
"lucidly and clearly. Therefore, we are compelled to overrule the said ground of appeal"
"as well."
