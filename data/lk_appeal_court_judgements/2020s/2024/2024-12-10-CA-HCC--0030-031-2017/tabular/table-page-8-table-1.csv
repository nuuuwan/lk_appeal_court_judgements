"CA/HCC/30-31/2017"
"I
t is trite law that no burden is cast upon the accused to prove his alibi, as"
"an alibi is not a defense. It is the duty of the Learned High Court Judge to"
"consider the alibi and if doubt arises in the mind of the Learned Trial Judge,"
"the benefit of the doubt must be awarded to the accused."
"T
he Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at pages 242 to 243 of the"
"brief had considered the evidence given by the Appellants and given reasons"
"as to why he rejects the defense evidence. Hence, this ground also has no"
"merit."
"In this case the Learned High Court Judge had considered and analyzed the"
"evidence accurately even though he did not have the advantage of seeing the"
"demeanour and deportment of the witnesses who had given evidence before"
"his predecessor."
"Further,  the  Appellants  had  given  evidence  under  oath  and  had  been"
"subjected to cross-examination by the State Counsel."
"The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial is the"
"observance of the principle of equality of arms between the defence and the"
"prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed throughout the trial,"
"means that both parties are treated in a manner ensuring their procedurally"
"equal position during the course of the trial."
"I
n  this  case  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  considered  the  evidence"
"presented by both parties to arrive at his decision. He has properly analyzed"
"the evidence given by both sides in his judgment. As the evidence adduced"
"by  the  Appellants  failed  to  create  a  doubt  over  the  prosecution  case,  the"
"conclusion reached by the learned High Court Judge in this case cannot be"
"faulted."
