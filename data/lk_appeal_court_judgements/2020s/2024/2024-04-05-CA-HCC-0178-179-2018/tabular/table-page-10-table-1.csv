"The  suspects,  along  with  the  Heroin  found,  and  the  three-wheeler  had  been"
"taken to the PNB where the quantity of Heroin recovered had been weighed in"
"front  of  the  suspects.  It  had  been  found  that  the  said  substance  had  a  total"
"weight  of  93  grams  and  900  milligrams.  Thereafter,  PW-01  has  taken  due"
"procedural steps to seal the Heroin found and to handover the said production"
"along with the money, the three-wheeler, and other productions to the relevant"
"production officers."
"At the trial, the witness has produced and marked the Heroin allegedly recovered"
"from the possession of the accused-appellants and other relevant productions."
"When  PW-01  was  subjected  to  cross-examination  by  the  defence,  he  has"
"maintained the initial position that their car was parked in such a manner that"
"the front of the car was facing the main road so that they can observe the road"
"properly. He has specifically replied to the suggestion that he was unable to see"
"what was happening in front of him that it was not so, and he and his team of"
"officers  clearly  observed  the  parcel  being  handed  over  by  the  2nd  accused-"
"appellant to the 1st accused-appellant."
"He has also stated that when he saw the 2nd accused-appellant for the first time,"
"he was walking from the direction of Borella towards the three-wheeler, but did"
"not see from where he came to the road."
"However, under constant cross-examination as to the way the vehicle was alleged"
"to  have  been  parked  in  the  car  park  of  Mel  Madura,  PW-01  appears  to  have"
"changed his earlier stance in that regard."
"At page 338 of the brief, he has stated as follows;"
