"I find it hard to believe that in a busy road like this, where vehicles travel both"
"ways, and vehicle parking is not allowed on the road, a drug trafficker who comes"
"from  the  correct  side  of  the  road,  would  come  across  the  road  and  park  his"
"vehicle in a manner anyone can see it as parked facing the towards the wrong"
