"It was held in the case of  Don  Samantha  Jude  Anthony  Jayamaha  Vs.  The"
"Attorney General, C.A. 303/2006 decided on 11-07-2012 that,"
"“Whether the witness of the defence or the dock statement is sufficient to"
"create a doubt cannot be decided in vacuum or in isolation, because it needs"
"to be considered in the totality of evidence, that is in the light of the evidence"
"for the prosecution as well as the defence.”"
"It is trite law that in a criminal case, a trial Judge has to consider prosecution"
"as well as defence evidence in its totality without compartmentalizing it."
"Our  Superior  Courts  have  consistently  laid  emphasis  on  the  duty  to  consider"
"the evidence as a whole, irrespective of whether the trial was held before a jury"
"or Judge. In the case of The King  Vs.  Appuhamy 37 NLR  281,  it was  stated"
"that ""One has to look at the whole case"". A similar approach was adopted by the"
"Court of Criminal Appeal in King  Vs.  Buckley 43 NLR 474, which imposed a"
"duty on the jurors that they should view the evidence as a whole. The judgments"
"of King  Vs.  De  Silva  41  NLR  337, King  Vs.  Perera  41  NLR  389, and  The"
"Queen Vs. Abadda 66 NLR 397 had adopted a similar view."
"In James Silva Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 Sri L.R. 167, it was clearly"
"stated that;"
"""A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider"
"all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by"
"the  defence 
in 
its totality without  compartmentalizing  and,  ask  himself"
"whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he"
"believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty."""
"With  the  above 
legal  principles 
in  mind,  I  will  now  consider  whether  the"
"prosecution evidence has passed the test of probability and whether there can"
"be any justification in the manner the learned High Court Judge analyzed the"
"relevant issues in favour of the prosecution version of events."
