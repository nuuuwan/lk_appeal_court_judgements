"PW-01 in his evidence in chief has given specific evidence to say that he and the"
"other officers who were in the car, came and parked their vehicle in the car park"
"of Mel Madura in a way that the front side of the vehicle was facing the main"
"road. This suggests that PW-01 who was in the front seat of the vehicle from the"
"left-hand  side of the driver, and  the other officers who were inside the vehicle"
"could very clearly see what was happening on the main road in front of them."
"If that could be believed, the trial Court could safely assume that PW-01 and the"
"other officer who gave evidence had a clear view of the road so that what they"
"say as to what unfolded before them could also be believed."
"However,  under  cross-examination  and  under  constant  questioning  as  to  the"
"geography  of  the  car  park,  PW-01  has  completely  changed  his  position  to  say"
"that  the  vehicle  was  parked  parallel  to  the  main  road  in  the  car  park  of  Mel"
"Medura and it was the driver of the vehicle who was nearest to the road, and"
"since he was seated next to the driver from the left side of him, he had to look at"
"the road by turning and through the driverâ€™s side glass of the door. I am of the"
"view that this creates a grave doubt as to the truthfulness of the utterances of"
"PW-01 and also the subsequent evidence of PW-02 who has spoken in line with"
"the subsequent evidence of PW-01 stating that their vehicle was parked parallel"
"to the road."
"In that context, it appears that if the vehicle was parked parallel to the road and"
"the  front  side  of  the  car  was  facing  the  Mel  Madura  building,  the  car  park"
"entrance being a narrow entrance, the view of the main road that can be obtained"
"from such a position would not be a wide view of the main road."
"The evidence of the PW-01 had been that the three-wheeler which came from the"
"direction of Horton Place roundabout towards Borella from the left-hand side of"
"the road turned towards the right-hand side of the road and parked the vehicle"
"right in front of the entrance to the car park, and he observed that the driver was"
"taking a call to someone."
