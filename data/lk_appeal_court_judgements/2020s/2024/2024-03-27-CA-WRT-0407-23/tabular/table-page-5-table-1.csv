"Respondents contend that, the petitioner has been remanded, but not for a period of 5 weeks"
"as initially stated, rather for 3 weeks. Over a span of 2 years and 1 month, the petitioner has"
"made 4 applications to vary bail conditions, all of which were granted by the Magistrate’s Court"
"of Kuliyapitiya. It is noted that the petitioner has not made an application to the Magistrate of"
"Kuliyapitiya  to  lift  the  travel  ban.  Furthermore,  the  petitioner  has  not  provided  any  medical"
"reason that would prevent her from traveling to the Kuliyapitiya Magistrate’s Court to hand over"
"the  passport.  Additionally,  the  petitioner  erroneously  submitted  her  age  as  79  instead  of  72"
"according to her National Identity Card. It is important to clarify that it is not the duty and the"
"responsibility of the Court of Appeal but rather that of the Magistrate’s Court to keep a record of"
"the petitioner's whereabouts. In light of these arguments, the respondents are seeking to dismiss"
"the application and maintain the original order."
