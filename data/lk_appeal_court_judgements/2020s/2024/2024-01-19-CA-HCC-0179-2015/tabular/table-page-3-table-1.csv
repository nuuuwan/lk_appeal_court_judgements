"to the turnbull principle."
"4.  The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the presumption"
"of innocence."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant contended that the learned"
"High Court Judge discredited the alibi raised by the 1st Accused-Appellant in"
"his evidence for the reason that no evidence has been presented before Court"
"as  to  who  was  with  the  1st Accused-Appellant  at  the  time  of  the  incident."
"Accordingly, it was argued that placing the burden on the Accused is against"
"the general principles with regard to the defence of alibi. When a defence of"
"alibi  is  taken,  there  is  no  burden  of  proof  on  the  Accused.  The  defence"
"evidence on alibi has to be merely weighed with the prosecution evidence. If"
"the alibi is not believed it fails. If it is believed it succeeds. If it is neither"
"believed nor disbelieved, but holds that it creates a reasonable doubt on the"
"prosecution case, the 1st Accused is entitled to be acquitted."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the 1st Accused-Appellant argued that the"
"1st Accused-Appellant was an unknown person to the 2nd witness who was the"
"eye witness to the shooting. The 1st Accused – Appellant was seen by her for"
"the first time in the same afternoon whilst engaged in an argument with the"
"deceased.    The  learned  President’s  Counsel  submitted  that  at  the  time  of"
"shooting she had only managed to obtain a side glance of the gunman who"
"was  on  a  moving  motorcycle. Accordingly,  he  contended  that  the  turnbull"
"principle has a paramount importance in this case. As per this well-established"
"principle Court has to consider,"
