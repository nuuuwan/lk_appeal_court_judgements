"body. Nevertheless, Injury No. 7 is an entry wound above left eye, on the front"
"of the body."
"Considering the existence of numerous entry wounds on the back, caused by"
"one gunshot, it appears implausible for the same gunshot to cause injury No."
"7 above the left eye. The prosecution did not question the Judicial Medical"
"Officer  about  this  particular  injury,  and  the  witness  also  did  not  offer  an"
"explanation."
"This  inconsistency  raises  questions  about  the  accuracy  of  the  eyewitness"
"testimonies and the possibility of more than one gunshot."
"As a result, substantial doubt arises concerning the truthfulness of the alleged"
"gunshot, as described by the 1st and 2nd witnesses."
"In  the  plaint  presented  to  the  Magistrate’s  Court  on  the  3rd April 2008,  the"
"prosecution listed an empty cartridge from a 9mm pistol and a melted lead"
"bullet.  The High Court called for the same productions from the Magistrate’s"
"Court1.  However,  as  per 
the  communication  from 
the  Registrar  of 
the"
"Magistrate’s Court of Trincomalee, the prosecution had submitted six empty"
"cartridges to the Magistrate’s Court. Notably, none of these productions were"
"produced or identified by the witnesses. Moreover, the prosecutions failed to"
"obtain a Government Analyst report concerning the pistol, bullets, and empty"
"cartridges, which could have established whether they were discharged from"
"the recovered pistol."
"If six empty cartridges were found at the crime scene, it logically implies that"
"at least six shots were discharged from the pistol. However, the testimony of"
"the two witnesses only mentions a single gunshot. This inconsistency raises a"
"significant  doubt  regarding  both  the  firearm  employed  and  the  number  of"
"shots fired."
"In view of the analysis above, I am of the view that the conviction and the"
"sentence imposed by the trial Judge is not supported by evidence and is clearly"
"against the weight of the evidence lead at the trial."
"The 
learned  Senior  Deputy  Solicitor  General 
for 
the  Complainant-"
"Respondents at the hearing rightly conceded that the judgement of this case"
"cannot be upheld and should be set aside."
