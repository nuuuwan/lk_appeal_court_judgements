"The  Learned  High  Court  of  Galle  also  had  observed  that  the  Appellant"
"had  not  invoked  Section  318  of  CPC  which  lays  down  the  Appellate"
"jurisdiction/Procedure with regard to an acquittal by the Magistrate. It"
"is very pertinent to observe that right of appeal under Section 318 is a"
"statutory right."
