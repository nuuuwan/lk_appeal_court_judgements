"In  Colombo  Apothecaries  Ltd  v  Commissioner  of  Labour  1998(3)","",""
"SLR 320 the Court held that:","",""
"","“The  power  of  revision  vested  in  the  court  is  discretionary.  The",""
"","power will be exercised when there is no other remedy available to",""
"a  party.","It 
is  only 
in  very 
rare","instances  where  exceptional"
"","circumstances  are  present  that  courts  would  exercise  powers  of",""
"revision","in  cases  where  an  alternative","remedy  has  not  been"
"","availed  of  by  the  applicant.  Thus,  the  general  principal  is  that",""
"","revision  will  not  lie  where  an  appeal  or  other  statutory  remedy  is",""
"","available.  It  is  only  if  the  aggrieved  party  can  show  exceptional",""
"","circumstances, for seeking relief by way of revision, rather than by",""
"","way  of  appeal,  when  such  appeal  is  available  to  him  as  of  right,",""
"that","the  court  will  exercise 
its 
revisionary","jurisdiction 
in 
the"
"","interests of due administration of justice.”",""
