"“1. Section 164 of the Civil Procedure Code provides that the Court may"
"question a witness at any time and by section 165 a Judge is vested with"
"a power to put  questions to a witness in order to discover or to obtain"
"proper proof of relevant facts."
"2. The Court must not question the witnesses in the spirit of beating him"
"down or encouraging him to give an answer."
"Per Somawansa, J.,"
"One must not forget the fact that even witnesses who are able to stand"
"their ground in the face of the severest cross-examination at the hands"
"of the opposing counsel are in view of the difference with which they treat"
"the  Court  incline  to  treat  with  greatest  regard  suggestions  when  they"
"come from Court and are couched in compelling language and it is a rare"
"witness  who  still  steadily  maintain  his  version  in  the  face  of  such"
"questioning by Court.”"
