"matters which the Judge considers have not been sufficiently cleared up or"
"questions which he himself thinks ought to have been put, he can, of course"
"take steps to see that deficiency is made good. It is, I think, generally more"
"convenient  to  do  this  when  the  counsel  has  finished  his  questions  or  is"
"passing  to  a  new  subject.  It  must  always  be  borne  in  mind  that  a  Judge"
"does not know what is in counsel’s brief and has not the same facilities as"
"counsel for an effective examination in chief or cross-examination.”"
