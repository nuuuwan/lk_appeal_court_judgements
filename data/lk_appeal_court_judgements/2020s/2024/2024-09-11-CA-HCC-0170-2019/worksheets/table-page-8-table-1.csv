"He  was  also  of  the  view  that  the  defence  put  forward  by  the  appellant  was  a"
"defence that cannot be believed; therefore, no prejudice has been caused to the"
"appellant because of the earlier mentioned excessive questioning."
"Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal"
"As the learned Counsel for the appellant argued this matter on the basis that"
"the appellant was denied of a fair trial and the learned High Court Judge  had"
"been biased towards the prosecution throughout the trial, I will now proceed to"
"consider the three grounds of appeal together as they are interrelated."
"Having listened to the submissions of the learned Counsel for the appellant and"
"that of the learned SDSG, it is the view of the Court that the question that should"
"be decided in this appeal is whether the manner in which the defence witnesses,"
"especially  the  daughter  of  the  appellant,  was  questioned  by  the  learned  High"
"Court  Judge  has  caused  a  prejudice  towards  him  and  thereby,  he  has  been"
"denied of a fair trial guaranteed to him under the provisions of the Constitution."
"The Article 13(3) of the Constitution reads as follows."
"13(3) Any person charged with an offence shall be entitled to be heard"
"in  person  or  by  an  Attorney-at-law,  at  a  fair  trial  by  a  competent"
"Court."
"The  relevant  section  165  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge may have used to question the defence witness reads as follows."
"165. The Judge may, in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of"
"relevant facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any time,"
"of any witness, or of the parties, about any fact relevant or irrelevant;"
"and may order the production of any document or thing; and neither"
"the parties nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection"
"to any such question or order, nor, without the leave of the Court, to"
"cross-examine  any  witness  upon  any  answer  given  in  reply  to  any"
"such question:"
