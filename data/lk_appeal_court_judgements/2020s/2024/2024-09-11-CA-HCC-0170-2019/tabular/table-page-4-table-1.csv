"was residing and had searched a room, and had then returned to Keselwatta and"
"searched a flat situated in Madaawi Flats where the appellant’s parents, sister"
"and some small children were living. The search of the houses has not resulted"
"in finding anything illegal. Thereafter, the appellant has been taken to the PNB"

"which was the days’ collection of the shop situated in Manning Market where he"
"was  employed.  He  has  claimed  that  police  officers  stopped  him  while  he  was"
