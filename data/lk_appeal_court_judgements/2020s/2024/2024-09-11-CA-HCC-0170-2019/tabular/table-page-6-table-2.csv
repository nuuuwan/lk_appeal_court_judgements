"the following grounds of appeal for consideration of the Court."
"1.  That the learned High Court Judge has acted contrary to the provisions"
"of section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance as he has encroached into the"
"role of the prosecutor and thereby denied a fair trial to the appellant."
"2.  That the learned High Court Judge has not given a fair opportunity to"
"the appellant to present the defence case."
"3.  That the learned High Court Judge  has failed to consider whether the"
"defence  version  passes  the  test  of  probability  rather  than  that  of  the"
"prosecution,  and  the  dock  statement  of  the  appellant  has  not  been"
"considered properly."
