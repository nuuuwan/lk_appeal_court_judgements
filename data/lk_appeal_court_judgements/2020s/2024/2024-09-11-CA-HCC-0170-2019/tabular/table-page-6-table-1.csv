"needs to be observed that when the daughter of the appellant was called upon"
"to give evidence and when the learned Counsel for the appellant led her evidence,"
"it was the learned High Court Judge  who has asked more questions from her"
"than the learned Counsel for the appellant who commenced leading her evidence"
"in chief. This appears to be the reason why the learned Counsel has informed"
"the Court that he will no longer call the daughter of the appellant as a witness."
"It needs to be observed further that the learned High Court Judge has put several"
"questions to her at the cross-examination as well."
"Pronouncing his judgment on 17-06-2019, the learned High Court Judge after"
"having  analyzed  the  evidence  placed  before  him  has  rejected  the  defence  put"
"forward by the appellant on the basis that it has no merit and is improbable. On"
"the basis that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, the"
"appellant  has  been  convicted  for  both  the  counts  preferred  against  him  and"
"sentenced accordingly."
