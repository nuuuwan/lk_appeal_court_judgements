"decision  of 
the  Magistrate.  Merely  because 
the  word"
"""inquiry""  is  used  in  those  sections,  it  is  clear  by  reading"
"those  sections  contextually  that  conducting  a  full trial  was"
"never 
the 
intention  of 
the 
legislature. 
If 
that  was 
the"
"intention,  as  stated 
in  section  8,  the  Magistrate  cannot"
"proceed  to  hear  and  determine  the  matter  forthwith.  it  is"
"not  mandatory  that  the  Magistrate  shall  fix  the  matter  for"
"the inquiry for oral evidence to be led. What the Magistrate"
"shall do is to give the person summoned a fair opportunity"
"to  satisfy  the  Court  that  he  has  a  valid  permit  or  other"
"written  authority  of  the  State  granted  in  accordance  with"
"any  written 
law.  The  person  so  summoned  cannot  be"
"allowed  to  convert  it  into  a  full-fledged  trial,  which  will"
"defeat the intention of the legislature.‚Äù"
