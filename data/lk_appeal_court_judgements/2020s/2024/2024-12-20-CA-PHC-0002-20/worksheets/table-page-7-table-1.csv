"II.","Has the High Court Judge erred when delivering the order dated"
"","31st

dismissing 
the

revision"
"","application?"
"18)","The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  very  well  considered  the  Order"
"","made by the Learned Additional Magistrate of Kandy."
"19)","The  Learned  Additional  Magistrate  of  Kandy  had  perused  all 
the"
"","documents 
submitted 
before  him 
and  had 
concluded 
that 
the"
"","Appellant's  claim  of  having  paid  an  advance  of  Rs.  150,000/-  for  the"
"","disputed  property  was  unsubstantiated  and 
the  Appellant 
in 
the"
"","instant action had failed to prove that he had been in possession of the"
"","property for a period of two months prior to the complaint lodged with"
"","the police."
"20)","Furthermore,  the  Learned  Additional  Magistrate  had  observed  that"
"","there were cases pending in the District Court concerning the disputed"
"","property."
"21)","On  these  grounds,  it  is  evident  that  the  Appellant  must  assert  his"
"","rights 
in  a  different 
forum 
if  there  was  an  agreement 
to  sell 
the"
"","disputed property."
"22)","Thus,  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  correctly  determined  that"
"","there  were  no  grounds 
to 
invoke 
revisionary 
jurisdiction,  as  no"
"","exceptional 
circumstances 
had 
been 
presented 
to  warrant 
the"
"","consideration of the application before the Judge of the High Court."
