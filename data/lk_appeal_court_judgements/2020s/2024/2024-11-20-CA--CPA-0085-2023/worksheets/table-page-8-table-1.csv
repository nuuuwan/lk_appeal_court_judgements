"He has referred to the word “carton” as a  much smaller cardboard box, which"
"carry several cigarette packets in packed form, and not the large cardboard box"
"as stated in the charges filed against the petitioners."
"However,  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  disagreed  with  the  said  contention  after"
"studying the Sinhala text of the Act, in relation to the words mentioned in section"
"34, which is the official version of the Act. It had been observed that the Sinhala"
"version is clearer without ambiguity, in which the requirement has been to have"
"the required pictorial warning on all packets, packages or cardboard boxes (සෑම"
"පැකට්ටුවක, ඇසුරුමක හ ෝ කාඩහබෝඩ හපට්ටියකම)."
"The  Court  has  proceeded  to  interpret  the  word  “carton”  used  in  the  English"
"translation of the Act as a reference made to the cardboard box mentioned in the"
"official version of the Act. It had been determined that the  petitioners need to"
"adhere to the requirement of exhibiting the pictorial warning in the said boxes"
"as well."
"However, it is clear from the judgment that the Court of Appeal has recognized"
"the fact of having an ambiguity between the official Sinhala version of the Act"
"and  its  English  translation,  and  has  proceeded  to  clear  the  said  ambiguity  in"
"pronouncing the relevant judgment."
"It  is  an  undisputed  fact  that  after  the  judgment  in  the  Writ  Application  was"
"pronounced, and the Leave to Appeal Application filed before the Supreme Court"
"was rejected, the petitioners have taken immediate steps to display the required"
"pictorial warning on the large cardboard boxes as well."
"When the matter was taken up before the Magistrate’s Court of Anuradhapura,"
"the  complainant-respondent-respondent  has  been  represented  by  the  Hon."
"Attorney General, and the parties have agreed to admit the evidence led in case"
"number 94695 to case number 94696 of the same Court as well, on the basis"
"that the facts relating to both the cases are the same."
