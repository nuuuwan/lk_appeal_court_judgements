"non-summary inquiry, he was not before the trial Court to give the evidence and"
"to face the test of cross-examination."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  whether  the  actions  of  the"
"deceased  were  a  result  of  exercising  his  right  of  private  defence.  After  having"
"considered the evidence made available to the trial Court, it has been determined"
"that there was no basis to come to such a conclusion."
"Thereafter, the learned High Court Judge has considered whether the action of"
"the appellant would fall under the exceptions for murder as provided in section"
"294 of the Penal Code."
"The learned High Court Judge has well considered whether the incident would"
"fall under exception 01, where grave and sudden provocation is applicable, and"
"exception 04, where sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel"
"shall become applicable."
"Although the appellant has claimed of a sudden fight and provocation, there was"
"no evidence before the trial Court to substantiate such a fact. The PW-01 has"
"seen the deceased being chased by the appellant and him pleading for his life"
"saying  not  to  attack.  Despite  this,  the  appellant  has  attacked  him  and  has"
"caused serious cut injuries using a manna knife which shows that the appellant"
"had the clear intention and the knowledge of causing the death of the deceased."
"Even though the motive is not an essential requirement to prove in a charge of"
"this nature, the evidence clearly shows that because of the deceasedâ€™s objections"
"for the appellant having a fish stall near his one, has contributed to this attack"
"on the deceased."
"It  needs  to  be  noted  that  it  is  the  same  Judge  who  heard  the  entirety  of  the"
"evidence has pronounced the judgement. Therefore, it is abundantly clear that"
"the learned trial Judge had the advantage of hearing the evidence in its entirety"
"and observing the demeanour and deportment of the witnesses."
