"PW13  says  that  the  appellant  has  asked  PW13  to  put  a  high-five  on  their"
"way 
to  Gampola. 
The 
celebratory 
nature 
of 
“high 
five” 
is 
grossly"
"inappropriate  in  the  context  of  a  tragic  explosion  that  resulted  in  multiple"
"deaths. This behavior suggests a lack of remorse, which would be expected"
"from an innocent person learning about such a devastating event. Instead, it"
"implies 
satisfaction 
or 
relief, 
further 
indicating 
the 
appellant’s  prior"
"knowledge  of  Thambi’s  actions  and  explosion,  which 
is  consistent  with"
"PW13’s  testimony,  but  contradicts  the  appellant’s  claim  of  innocence.  The"
"appellant,  however,  did  not  seriously  challenge  the  above  stance  taken  by"
"PW13."
"It has been suggested to PW13 as follows, which he had denied."
"ප්රe: 
මම තමාට මයෝජනා කරනවා මේ තමා හඳුනා ෙන්න තරුණයාව තමාව අරන් ඇවිේ තමාමේ"
