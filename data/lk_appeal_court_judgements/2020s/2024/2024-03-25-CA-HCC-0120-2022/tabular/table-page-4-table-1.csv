"the function tomorrow. Thereafter, the appellant has held the victim child on his"
"lap, talked to her, and had taken her in between two dolphin vans parked nearby."
"There had been no light, and it was dark."
"The  evidence  of  the  victim  child  clearly  shows  that  she  had  been  reluctant  to"
"come out with what happened to her thereafter. She has stated that after taking"
"her there, the appellant started to touch her and lifted the dress she was wearing."
"He  has  started  touching  her  thighs  and  moved  upwards  and  touched  her"

"run  away.  Upon  questioning  further,  she  has  clearly  stated  that  he  kept  on"
"touching her undergarment and touched her genitals."

"her grandmother, but it appears that the grandmother has not taken any notice"
"of what the victim child was stating to her."
"She has been studying in grade 4 of her school at that time, and it appears that"
"the victim has been silently suffering because of this incident."
"As a result of an awareness program conducted in the school, she has come out"
"as to what happened to her by informing the incident to one Osman Kulas, who"
"was  the  person  who  conducted  that  awareness  program.  This  has  resulted  in"
"police being made aware of this incident and the resultant investigations had led"
"to the charges against the appellant."
"The  cross-examination  of  the  victim  child  reveals  that  she  has  informed  this"
"incident  to  the  earlier  mentioned  person  only  in  the  year  2014,  and  the  said"
"person was the Child welfare Service Officer attached to Assistant Government"
"Agent's office in the area. It has also been revealed that when the child informed"
"her grandmother, she has gone and scolded the appellant."
