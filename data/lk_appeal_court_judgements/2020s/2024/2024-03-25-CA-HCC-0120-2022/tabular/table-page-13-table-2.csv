"74 it was held:"
"(1) When  faced  with  contradictions  in  a  witness  testimonial,  the  Court"
"must bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions,"
"viewed in light of the whole of the evidence given by the witness."
"(2) Too great a significance cannot be attached to minor discrepancies, or"
"contradictions."
"(3) What  is  important  is  whether  the  witness  is  telling  the  truth  on  the"
"material matters concerned with the event."
"(4) Where evidence is generally reliable, much importance should not be"
"attached to the minor discrepancies and technical errors."
