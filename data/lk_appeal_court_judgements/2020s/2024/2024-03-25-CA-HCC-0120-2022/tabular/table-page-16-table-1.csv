"However,  when  called  for  a  defence,  his  evidence  has  been  to  the  effect  that,"
"because his family and  children  are  well  educated, the villagers are  jealous of"
"them,  and  it  was  the  reason  for  this  false  complaint.  Apart  from  that,  he  has"
"taken the position  that  because he supported a relative of  him  in the election"
"against the wishes of the people of the village, the villagers are against him."
"I find that none of these positions had been suggested to the relevant witnesses"
"when they gave evidence. Even if it is to be assumed that the victim child, due"
"to her age, may not be able answer such a suggestion, at least that suggestion"
"should have been put to the mother of the victim child, which was not the case."
"In  fact,  her  mother  has  confirmed  that  she  and  her  daughter  attended  the"
"wedding function that was held in the appellantâ€™s house, which shows that there"
"had not been any enmity between them, which may be the very reason why no"
"such suggestion has been put to the mother of the victim child."
"It is well-settled law that when an accused person takes up a particular line of"
"defence, that has to be put to the relevant witnesses when they come and give"
"evidence before the Court so that they can be confronted with the said stand."
"Failure to do so will be a factor that has to be considered against the relevant"
"person."
