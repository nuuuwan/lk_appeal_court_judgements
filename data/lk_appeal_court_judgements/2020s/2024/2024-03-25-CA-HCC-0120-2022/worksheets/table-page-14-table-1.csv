"with regard to the acceptance or rejection of the testimony of a witness"
"unless it is manifestly wrong."
"For the reasons as considered above, I find that the evidence taken in its totality"
"had been cogent  and trustworthy, which provides no basis for the considered"
"grounds of appeal."
"The learned President’s Counsel argued that in the 2nd count preferred against"
"the  appellant,  the  act  alleged  to  have  been  committed  by  the  appellant  which"
"amounts to grave sexual abuse was inserting a finger into the vagina of the victim"
"child. It was the submission of the  learned President’s Counsel  that  since the"
"victim child has not stated specifically that the appellant inserted the finger into"
"her vagina, the prosecution has failed to prove the specific charge."
"The definition of grave sexual abuse as stated in Section 365B of the Penal Code"
"refers to an act committed by any person who, for sexual gratification, does any"
"act,  by  the  use  of  his  genitals  or  any  other  part  of  the  human  body  or  any"
"instrument on any orifice or part of the body of any other person, being an act"
"which  does  not  amount  to  rape  in  terms  of  Section  363  of  the  Penal  Code  on"
"circumstances falling under the categories mentioned in Section 365B (1) and"
"(2)."
"When  scrutinizing  the    evidence  of  the  child  given  before  the  trial  Court,  it  is"
"quite apparent that  the victim child has been a  reluctant witness, for  obvious"
"reasons. I find no basis to believe that her reluctance has been due to her saying"
"something that did not happen or due to her making a false statement. Her initial"
"evidence has been that the  appellant  touched her with his  hand, touched her"
"thighs and started moving up, and at that point, she took his hands off and ran"
"away. When questioned further, she has been specific that the appellant lifted"
"her  dress  and  touched  her  genitals,  but  has  stated  that  she  cannot  say  the"
"manner in which he touched her genitals."
