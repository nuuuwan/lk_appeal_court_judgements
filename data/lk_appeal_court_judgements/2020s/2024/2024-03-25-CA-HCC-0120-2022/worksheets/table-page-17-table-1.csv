"His Lordship Sisira de Abrew, J. stated in Pilippu Mandige Nalaka Krishantha"
"Kumara Thisera Vs A.G CA 87/2005 decided on 17-05-2007 that;"
"“….I hold that whenever evidence given by a witness on a material point is"
"not  challenged  in  cross  examination,  it  has  to  be  concluded  that  such"
"evidence is not disputed and is accepted by the opponent subject of course"
"to the qualification that the witness is a reliable witness.”"
"This Court is very much mindful that the weaknesses of the defence case would"
"not  be  a  reason  to  conclude  against  the  accused  person  in  a  criminal  trial."
"However, I am of the view that irrespective of the weaknesses of the defence case,"
"the  prosecution  has  proved  the  case  beyond  reasonable  doubt  against  the"
"appellant when considering the evidence as a whole."
"Therefore, I find no reasons to interfere with the conviction and sentence by the"
"learned High Court Judge."
"The  appeal  is  dismissed  due  to  want  of  any  merit.  The  conviction  and  the"
"sentence affirmed."
"Since  the  appellant  is  on  bail  pending  appeal,  the  sentence  against  him  shall"
"take effect from the date this judgment is pronounced upon the appellant by the"
"learned High Court Judge of Mannar."
"Judge of the Court of Appeal"
"P, Kumararatnam, J."
"I agree."
