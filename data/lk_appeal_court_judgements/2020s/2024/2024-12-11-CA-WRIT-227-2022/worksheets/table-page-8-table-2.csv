"effort to explain the above sentence as follows by referring to an instance of making a written"
"offer of a golden handshake subject to certain conditions;"
"“If for instance an employer were to make a written offer of a ""golden handshake"", stating ""if you"
"agree to the termination of your services, please accept the enclosed cheque for X rupees as your"
"terminal benefits and sign and return the annexed receipt,"" the written offer together with the"
"acceptance  of  the  cheque  and  the  signing  of  the  receipt  would  constitute  a  ""prior  consent  in"
"writing"" to termination within the meaning of section 2(1)(a). However, it is not necessary to"
"decide that question because, as learned State Counsel submitted on behalf of the 1st Respondent,"
"there  is  a  difference  between  consent  to  the  termination  itself  (which  is  what  section  2(1)(a)"
"requires),  and  an  agreement  -  as  in  this  case  -  as  to  the  quantum  of  terminal  benefits  in"
"circumstances  in  which  the  termination  itself  is  no  longer  negotiable  or  has  already  been"
"unilaterally  determined  or  effected  (which  is  not  enough).  The  Petitioner's  letters  and  the  2nd"
"Respondent's  acceptance  of  the  payments  were  all  subsequent  to  the  Petitioner's  unilateral"
"decision to terminate the 2nd Respondent's services, and are not proof of anything more than his"
"agreement to the benefits payable consequent upon that decision. The 2nd Respondent did not give"
"prior consent, in writing or otherwise, to the termination of his services, but subsequently agreed"
"to and accepted the terminal benefits offered.”"
