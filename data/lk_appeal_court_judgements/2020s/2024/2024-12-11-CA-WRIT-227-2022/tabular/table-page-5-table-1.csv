"Therefore, my view is that when a workman (workman or an employee who comes within the"
"scheduled employment in TEWA) is serving during the probationary period, the employer’s duty"
"is not only to assess the employee but also to provide necessary training, guidance and supervisory"
"support  to  the  employee.  More  than  anything,  it  is  the  mandatory  duty  of  the  employer  to"
"complete a formal review of the performance of the employee by the end of the probationary period"
"stipulated in the letter of appointment. It is vital that the outcome of the review be communicated"
"to the employee.”"
