"not suitable to carry out the work assigned to him, provided that (a). the employer has treated the"
"employee with a helping hand to overcome his shortcomings, (b). a proper review procedure has"
"been adopted (c). and most importantly such decision to terminate has been taken subject to the"
"provisions of the section 2 (particularly 2(1) & 2(4)) of TEWA."
"I have arrived at the above conclusions after carefully perusing all the judgements cited by the"
"Petitioner & Respondents and also by taking into consideration the scheme of TEWA and the"
"Industrial Disputes Act. It will be unfair to the employee and may be in another instance to the"
"employer, if the labour law is going to be established only by reading certain sentences or small"
"passages of a judgement without giving a realistic view in the guise of the relevant statutory law."
"I take the view that misconceptions in law should be avoided with proper understanding the real"
"characteristics of ‘ratio decidendi’ and ‘obiter dictum’ of a judgement and also by reading the"
"entire judgement. Furthermore, it is important to note that no employer has a right to override"
"the  statutory  provisions  stipulated  in  Section  2  of  TEWA.  The  employer  is  bound  to  follow"
"Section 2 of TEWA by which it is mandatory to get prior written approval of the Commissioner"
"(when prior consent of the employee is not there) to terminate the scheduled employment of any"
"workman on non disciplinary grounds.”"
