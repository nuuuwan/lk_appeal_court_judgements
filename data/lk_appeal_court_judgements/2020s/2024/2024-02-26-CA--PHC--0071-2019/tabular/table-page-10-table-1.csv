"However, when questioned by the Court at a later stage of his evidence he has"
"stated that he purchased the vehicle in November 2014 and handed it over to"
"his friend in the year 2017."
"The  appellant  has  stated  that  on  the  3rd  of  April  2018,  he  came  to  know"
"through  his  friend  that  the  vehicle  was  detained  by  the  Bandaragama  police."
"He has claimed that when he came later to the police station only, he came to"
