"came forward before the Court as the registered owner of the vehicle, who was"
"not  the  accused  in  the  case,  to  establish  the  requirements  of  the  proviso  of"
"section 40 (1) of the Forest Ordinance in order to decide whether to confiscate"
"the vehicle involved in the offence or not."
"It  clearly  appears  that  the  petitioner  knew  very  well  the  matters  he  needed  to"
"establish before the Court when he gave evidence before the Magistrate’s Court"
"under the guidance of his Counsel. It is my view that any alleged defects of the"
"charge had no relevance to the inquiry held before the Magistrate’s Court as no"
"prejudice  has  been  caused  to  the  accused  even  if  there  was  any  defect  as"
"alleged."
"Under  the  circumstances,  I  will  now  proceed  to  consider  whether  the  learned"
"Magistrate  was  correct  when 
it  was  determined  that  the  evidence  of  the"
"petitioner  cannot  be  relied  upon,  and  he  has  attempted  to  concoct  a  story"
"before the Court."
"As determined correctly by the learned Magistrate, the petitioner had been the"
"registered  owner  of  the  vehicle  subjected  to  the 
inquiry.  According  to  the"
"petitioner, as stated in his evidence in chief,  he has purchased this vehicle in"
"the  year  2017,  and  after  using  it  for  his  business  purposes,  had  handed  over"
"the  vehicle  to  a  close  friend  of  him  called  Mahinda  to  be  used  in  his  cement"
"block manufacturing business."
"He has handed over the vehicle in December 2017 on the basis that his friend"
"should pay a monthly amount of Rs. 50000/-. The vehicle had been subjected"
"to  a  finance  facility  and  the  petitioner  had  paid  the  monthly  finance  rental"
"which  amounted  to  a  sum  of  Rs.  42000/-  out  of  the  monthly  payment  he"
"received 
for  the  vehicle.  It  had  been  his  evidence  that  he  gave  necessary"
"instructions  to  his  friend  that  the  vehicle  should  not  be  used  for  any  illegal"
"activities, and his instruction was to hand over the vehicle every day after work"
"at his house."
