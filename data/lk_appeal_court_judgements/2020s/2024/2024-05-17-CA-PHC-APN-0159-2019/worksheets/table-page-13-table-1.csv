"It is the view of this Court that, the learned Magistrate should have looked into"
"the above-mentioned aspects as well, when determining as to who should have"
"the possession of the vehicles until the final determination of the case."
"I am of the view that, if considered in the correct perspective, the vehicles should"
"have been handed over to the respondent company until the final determination"
"of  the  action,  rather  than  to  the  petitioner  of  this  matter,  since  the  initial"
"complaint of the petitioner had been one of cheating by issuing cheques without"
"sufficient funds in the bank."
"Accordingly, I find no reason to disagree with the determinations of the learned"
"High Court Judge in that regard, and the decision to set aside the order of the"
"learned Magistrate."
"However, I am not in agreement with the learned High Court Judge’s decision to"
"hand over the vehicles to the respondent company without any conditions, since"
"the said vehicles should be considered as productions of the Magistrate’s Court"
"case  until  the  conclusion  of  the  said  case  before  the  Magistrate’s  Court  of"
"Colombo Fort."
"Therefore, I hold that, the respondent company shall enter into 3 separate bonds"
"of Rs. 15 million/-, each in relation to the relevant 3 vehicles, agreeing to produce"
"them before the Magistrate’s Court when necessary. The respondent company is"
"also prevented from handing over the possession of the vehicles or transfer the"
"ownership without the permission of the learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort."
"Subjected to the above variance to the judgment pronounced by the learned High"
"Court Judge of Colombo, the revision application is dismissed."
"The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High"
"Court of Colombo for information."
