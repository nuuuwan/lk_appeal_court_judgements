"the plan had already been approved on 3rd June 2005, well before the application"
"was submitted on 3rd August 2006."
"The Appellants  highlighted  evidence  of  a  witness  from  the  Urban  Council  of"
"Panadura, indicating that the building permit was not extended during the period"
"from 2005 to 201219. However, it is important to note that the building plan was"
"approved  in  2005,  and  the  application  under  Section  18A  was  made  in  2006."
"Therefore, when the application was submitted, there was indeed an approved"
"plan  in  place20. The  validity  of  that  plan,  however,  expired  in  2010  after  five"
"years, while the application was still pending."
"Another  key  consideration  regarding  the  genuineness  of  the  application  is"
"whether it is an attempt to evict the tenant under the guise of an application under"
"Section  18A  of  the  Rent Act.  In  this  case,  the  original  applicant  also  initiated"
"proceedings  in  the  District  Court  of  Panadura  to  evict  the  tenants  from  the"
"premises21, but that case was dismissed on 7th February 2013. The application"
"under Section 18A, however, was made on 3rd August 2006, meaning it was not"
"filed in response to the dismissal of the District Court action."
"The exact date of the filing of the District Court case is unclear from the available"
"material, but according to the judgment, the original applicant claimed damages"
"from the tenants starting from 1st August 2008. This suggests that  the District"
"Court case was likely filed in 2008. Therefore, it cannot be said that the original"
"applicant  used  Section  18A  as  a  means  to  evict  the  tenant  after  failing  in  the"
"District Court case. It is important to recognize that a landlord has the right to"
"pursue different remedies available under the Rent Act simultaneously."
"In  my  view,  the  potential  economic  benefit  to  the  landlord  could  also  be  a"
"relevant consideration for the Housing Commissioner. The statutory rent paid by"
"the Appellants is only Rs. 634.6422, which, in my opinion, is a relatively small"
