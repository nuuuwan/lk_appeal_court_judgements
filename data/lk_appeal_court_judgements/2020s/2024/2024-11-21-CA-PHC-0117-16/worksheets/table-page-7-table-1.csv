"do concede that, in an application under Section 18A of the Rent Act, proof that"
"the building is over 40 years old is indeed necessary."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the Appellant  argued  that  the  test  to  be"
"applied regarding the age of the building is 'objective' rather than 'subjective,' in"
"contrast to the second requirement, which concerns whether the redevelopment"
"of the land on which the building stands is necessary for more efficient utilization"
"of the land."
"The ‘Black’s law Dictionary’ defines the word ‘objective’ as ‘of, relating to, or"
"based  on  externally  verifiable  phenomena,  as  opposed 
to  an 
individual’s"
"perceptions, feelings or intentions.’6"
"The  word  ‘subjective’  is  defined  as  ‘based  on  an  individual’s  perceptions,"
"feelings, or intentions as opposed to externally verifiable phenomena.’7"
"As correctly submitted by the learned President’s Counsel for the Appellants, the"

"is indeed over 40 years old."
"The  Respondents  submitted  notices  of  assessment  and  extracts 
from 
the"
"assessment register to support their claim that the building was over 40 years old."
"According to the assessment register extracts, the property was described in 1966"
"as  a  ‘tiled  residence  and  land’  with  an  annual  value  of  Rs.  400/-.  This  same"
"description  and  value  persisted  until  1973.  In  1974,  the  property  description"
"changed to a ‘concrete roofed shop and land’ with the annual value increasing"
"to Rs. 2,000/-. The same entry appeared in 1975 as well. Following this, a special"
