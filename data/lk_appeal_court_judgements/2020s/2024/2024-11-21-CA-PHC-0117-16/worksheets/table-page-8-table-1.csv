"note was added to the register indicating that, due to a fire at the Urban Council"
"Office, records prior to 1987 were unavailable. In 1989, the description of the"
"property changed again to an ‘asbestos roofed shop and the land’ and the annual"
"value increased to Rs. 5,400/-. These entries continued until 1998, and in 1999,"
"the description was updated to a ‘concrete and asbestos roofed two storied retail"
"shop’. with the annual value further increased to Rs. 37,440/-."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the Appellant  argued  that  it  is  clear  that"
"around 1966, there was a residential building with a tiled roof and the rest of the"
"land. In 1974, it was converted into a shop with a concrete roof. He contended"
"that a new building was constructed in 1974. Furthermore, an asbestos-roofed"
"shop was built on or before 1989. Then, around 1999, a two-story retail shop"
"with a combination of concrete and asbestos roofing was constructed, covering"
"the entire land. Therefore, he argued that the building the Respondents seek to"
"demolish  is  a  new  structure  from  1999,  not  the  one  that  existed  in  1966.  He"
"pointed out that the changes to the building are reflected in the increase in its"
"annual value. However, it is well known that Urban Councils periodically raise"
"the annual value of properties within their jurisdiction.9"
"The learned President’s Counsel argued that the Housing Commissioner applied"
"a purely subjective test in determining the age of the building to be demolished,"
"relying primarily on her own observations during her inspection10. However, I"
"note that the Housing Commissioner did not solely rely on her own observations"
"to reach the conclusion that the building is over 40 years old. She has explicitly"
"stated  that,  in  addition  to  her  observations,  she  considered  other  sources  of"
"evidence,  including  the  deeds,  assessment  registers,  and  oral  testimony  from"
"witnesses.  Based  on  this  comprehensive  review,  she  was  satisfied  that  the"
"building was indeed over 40 years old. Furthermore, the Housing Commissioner"
"also  obtained  a  report  from  the Authorised  Officer11,  who,  based  on  his  own"
"inspection, opined that the building was over 50 years old."
