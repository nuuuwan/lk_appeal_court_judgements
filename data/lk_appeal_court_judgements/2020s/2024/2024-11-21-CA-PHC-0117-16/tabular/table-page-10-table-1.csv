"changes  were  limited  to  certain  alterations  and  renovations.  Consequently,  I"
"uphold the findings of the learned High Court Judge."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant argued that the learned High"
"Court Judge erred in stating that the real picture or the changes to the premises"
"were  not  reflected  in  the  Assessment  Register.  According  to  the  assessment"
"registers, there have been changes to the original structure in 1974, 1989, and"
"1999. The learned President’s Counsel contended that these changes, particularly"
"the alterations to the roof, serve as evidence that a new building was constructed."
"He  further  argued  that  the  increase  in  the  annual  value  supports  this  claim,"

"The second requirement for a successful application under Section 18A is that"
"the Housing Commissioner must be satisfied that the redevelopment of the land"
"on  which  the  building  stands  is  necessary  for  more  efficient  utilization  of  the"
"land."
"The  determination  of  this  fact  depends  on  the  circumstances  of  each  case.  In"
"reaching a conclusion on this matter, the Housing Commissioner has a duty to"
"consider all relevant circumstances as they exist at the time of the hearing. Some"
"factors may carry little or no weight, while others may be decisive. However, the"
