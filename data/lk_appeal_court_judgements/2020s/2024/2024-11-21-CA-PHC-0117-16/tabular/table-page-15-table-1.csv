"In  the  case  of  Anura  Abeysinghe  alias  Abayasinghe  v  Galle  Co-operative"
"Hospital  Limited25  (C.A.)  His  Lordship  Mahinda  Samayawardhena,  J.  (as  His"
"Lordship  then  was)  stated  that,  ‘There  is  a  misconception  that  even  if  an"
"administrative or judicial decision is patently erroneous, writ of certiorari does"
"not lie, if the decision-making process was flawless, and the deciding authority"
"has erred on facts and not on law.’"
"‘It is important to understand that an error of fact can also be an error of law.’"
"Accordingly, I find myself unable to agree with the learned High Court Judge's"
"conclusion that ‘the purpose of a Writ of certiorari is not to, consider whether"
"the decision is correct or not but to consider whether decision given is within the"
"power.’"
"The question of whether there was insufficient evidence to support the Housing"
"Commissioner's conclusion is also relevant."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge,  in  the  impugned  order,  observed  that  it  was"
"evident  the  3rd  Respondent,  the  Housing  Commissioner,  had  issued  the  order"
"under Section 18A of the Rent Act while adhering to the correct procedure. The"
"learned High Court Judge further noted that all relevant factors had been duly"
"considered and that the Housing Commissioner acted within her lawful authority,"
"without  exceeding  her  jurisdiction.  The  evidence  considered  by  the  Housing"
"Commissioner, as analysed in this judgment, clearly provided sufficient grounds"
"for her to arrive at the conclusion that she did."
"Conclusion"
"In view of the reasoning set forth in this judgment regarding the matter at issue,"
"I find no grounds to justify interfering with the order of the learned High Court"
"Judge dated 5th October 2016, whereby the writ of certiorari seeking to quash"
"the Housing Commissioner’s decision was dismissed."
