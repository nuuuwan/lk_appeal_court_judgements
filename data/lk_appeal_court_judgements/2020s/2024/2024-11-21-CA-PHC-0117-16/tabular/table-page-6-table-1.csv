"18A in the terms ‘if the Commissioner is satisfied’ the evident intention of the"
"Legislature was to make the Commissioner the sole Judge of whether conditions"
"existed to warrant demolition.’"
"In the recent judgment of this Court in  Kithsiri Pradeep Witharana v. P. Leka"
"Geethanjalee Perera and others5, the Court of Appeal observed as follows:"
"‘The Act has not specified any condition other than the age of the building. The"
"Commissioner has to consider whether the commercial building that has been"
"constructed  more  than  40  years  ago  to  suit  the  socio-economic  environment"
"prevailed during that time is good enough to serve the present-day requirements."
"The land area does not expand with the expansion of the population and their"
"requirements. Therefore, the only solution to fulfil the need of the society is to"
"utilize 
the 
land  more  effectively.  Whether 
this  can  be  done  by 
just  a"
"renovation/modification  or  whether  the  building  needs  a  structural  change  is"
"matter 
to  be  decided  by 
the  Commissioner.  Whether 
the  building 
is 
in  a"
"dilapidated condition or not is not material. What is material is that whether the"
"re-development of the land on which such building stands is necessary for the"
"more efficient utilization of such land.’"
"Whether the building sought to be demolished is more than 40 years old?"
"The  application  of  Section  18A 
is  not 
limited 
to 
the  buildings 
those  are"
"dilapidated  and  require 
immediate  demolition  and  reconstruction.  The  key"
"consideration in granting or rejecting an application is not the condition of the"
"building, but its age and the necessity for redevelopment to ensure more efficient"
"utilization of the land."
"The  primary  argument  put  forth  by  the  learned  President's  Counsel  for  the"
"Appellants was that the Respondents failed to prove that the building was more"
"than 40 years old at the time the application was made. He argued that, under the"
"Rent  Act,  strict  proof  of  this  fact  is  required.  To  support  this  argument,  he"
"highlighted that the reduction of the building's age requirement from 50 years to"
"40 years reflects the Legislature's intention to demand strict proof of this fact. I"
