"Housing  Commissioner  should  not  disregard  any  relevant  facts  and  must"
"consider all of them, giving each the appropriate weight and adopting a common-"
"sense  approach.  It  is  in  this  context  that  the  Housing  Commissioner's  own"
"investigation becomes crucial."
"The Housing Commissioner can only be satisfied on this matter by considering"
"all  the  surrounding  circumstances,  such  as  the  condition  of  the  building,  its"
"location,  the  potential  for  more  efficient  and  profitable  use  of  the  land  after"
"redevelopment, the financial means of the landlord, and other relevant factors. It"
"is  not  enough  for  the  landlord  to  simply  state  an  intention  to  build  a  new"
"structure; the landlord must establish the genuineness of this intention. It is the"
"responsibility of the Applicant (Respondent) to provide sufficient evidence to the"
"satisfaction of the Housing Commissioner in this regard. Without such evidence,"
"the Housing Commissioner cannot be properly satisfied."
"In order to establish the bona fides and the reality of the application, the applicant"
"should provide supporting evidence, such as the building plan, approval of the"

"applicant  has  the  financial  means  to  carry  out  the  redevelopment.  Only  by"
"providing  such  evidence  the  Housing  Commissioner  can  be  satisfied  of  the"
"genuineness and feasibility of the application."
"However,  in  the  case  of  Kithsiri  Pradeep  Witharana15,  the  Court  of  Appeal"
"expressed the following view:"
"The Act does not provide that the financial capacity of the landlord as a material"
"fact in an inquiry under section 18A of the Rent Act. Instead, the law provides"
"that if the landlord fails to re-develop the building within the specified period or"
"periods, he is running at the risk of acquiring the land by the state. Therefore, it"
"is for the landlord to obtain necessary financial assistance and it is not for the"
"1st Respondent to satisfy that he has financial capacity to redevelop."
"Nevertheless, in my view, this Court has not entirely dismissed the relevance of"
"the applicant's financial capacity. It was merely stated that it is not a material fact"
"in  itself.  In  an  application  under  Section  18A  of  the  Rent  Act,  the  Housing"
