"Introduction"
"The Applicant, T.G.  Perera,  the  landlord  of  the  property  at  No.  98,  Janapriya"
"Mawatha,  Panadura,  submitted  an  application  under  Section  18A  of  the  Rent"
"Act1 to the 3rd Respondent, the Housing Commissioner of the Western Province,"
"seeking  permission 
to  demolish 
the  building 
for 
redevelopment. 
It 
is  an"
"undisputed fact that late T.G. Perera was the landlord while the Appellants were"
"the tenants."
"While 
the 
inquiry  was  ongoing,  T.G.  Perera  passed  away,  and 
letters  of"
"administration for his estate were granted to the 1st and 2nd Respondents. As a"
"result, the 1st and 2nd Respondents were substituted in place of late T.G. Perera."
"The 
Respondents-Petitioner-Appellants 
(hereinafter 
referred 
to 
as 
the"
"‘Appellants’)  filed  statement  of  objections  to  the  application  made  by  the"
"landlord, the initial applicant."
"Following  the  inquiry,  the  3rd  Respondent  made  an  order  on  25th April  2014,"
"allowing the application of the 1st and 2nd Respondents, subject to the payment"
"of Rs. 374,400/- as compensation to the Appellants."
"The aggrieved Appellants sought a mandate in the nature of writ of  certiorari"
"from the Provincial High Court of Colombo to quash the order issued by the 3rd"
"Respondent."
"The learned High Court Judge of Colombo dismissed the Appellant’s application"
"by his judgment dated 5th October 2016. This appeal is filed against the judgment"
"of the learned High Court Judge."
"Analysis"
"Undoubtedly, the primary objective of the Rent Act is to protect the rights and"
"interests  of  tenants.  Enacted  in  1972,  the  Rent  Act  underwent  a  significant"
"amendment 
in  19802,  when 
the  Legislature 
introduced  Section  18A.  This"
