"is only supported by a mere assertion that the detention orders under section 15A of PTA are"
"permitted only when there is a valid indictment. The contention of the Petitioner is that no"
"valid detention order can be issued under the said section if the respective indictment is void"
"ab initio. Thus, based on the reasons given above to disregard the arguments of the Petitioners"
"challenging  the  indictment,  no  further  examination  is  required  to  consider  whether  the"
"impugned detention order is invalid."
"Anyhow, the submissions of the Petitioner in this regard suffer from several flaws. This Court"
"has constantly decided that judicial review should only be sought where there is a clear and"
"blatant error in the discretion of the impugned decision including the decision-making process"
"or  when  the  authorities  have  acted  beyond  their  jurisdiction.  The  term  ‘blatant’  should  be"
"interpreted according to Rules of the Court and other written laws. Such interpretation cannot"
"be  confined  to  a  meaning  given  in  a  linguistics  Dictionary.  Hence,  the  Petitioner  has  not"
"satisfied this Court that there exists a blatant error in law in respect of the impugned detention"
"order."

"The Respondents urge that the instant Application of the Petitioner be dismissed in limine"
"because  a  previous  application  bearing  No.  CA/WRIT/225/2024 seeking  the  same  reliefs"
"was withdrawn. The said writ Application No. CA/WRIT/225/2024 has been filed by the"
"father of the Petitioner of the instant Application. The Respondents contend that the conduct"
"of the Petitioner amounts to an abuse of process as he had his father file the earlier Application"
"and subsequently withdraw it."
"Now  I  must  examine  the  reliefs  sought  in  the  instant  Application  as  well  as  in  the  said"
"Application No. CA/WRIT/225/2024. It is observed that the primary reliefs in the said case"
"CA/WRIT/225/2024 set out in paragraph ‘(c)’, ‘(d)’, ‘(e)’, in its prayer are as follows;"
