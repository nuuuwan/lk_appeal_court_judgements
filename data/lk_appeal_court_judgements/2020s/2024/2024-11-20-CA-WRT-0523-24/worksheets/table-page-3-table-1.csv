"Decided on: 20.11.2024"
"Sobhitha Rajakaruna J."
"The  Attorney  General 
served 
the 
indictment  marked 
‘P1’ 
to  Nadun  Chinthaka"
"Wickramaratne  alias  Harakkata  who  is  the  Petitioner  of  the  instant  Application  and  two"
"others. The Petitioner is being kept in the custody of the authorities of the Counter Terrorism"
"and Investigation Division (‘CTID’) at the old prison in Tangalle in terms of an order under"
"section 15A (1) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No.48 of 1979"
"(‘PTA’), marked ‘P2’, issued by the 2nd Respondent - Secretary to the Ministry of Defence."
"The Petitioner primarily seeks a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the"
"said indictment ‘P1’ and the said detention order marked ‘P2’."
"The  Petitioner  primarily  argues 
that 
the  Attorney  General  has 
issued  an 
indictment"
"prematurely,  based  on  incomplete  investigations,  and  therefore,  no  valid  indictment  exists"
"before the relevant High Court. The Petitioner points out that when the indictment was filed,"
"12 suspects were involved in the Magistrate’s Court Case No. B/27181/23, but only three,"
"including the Petitioner, were named in the impugned indictment. Citing the 'B Report’ dated"
"28.02.2024, the Petitioner highlights that investigations into several telephone numbers were"
"still  ongoing  at 
the 
time.  Additionally, 
the  Attorney  General, 
through  a 
letter  dated"
"22.03.2024, discharged the 2nd, 6th, 8th, 9th, 11th and 12th suspects from the Magistrate’s Court"
"Case.  The  Petitioner  expresses  concerns  about  the  lack  of  reference  to  the  remaining  four"
"suspects from the Magistrate’s Court Case, arguing that the status of investigations concerning"
"these suspects is crucial to the validity of the impugned indictment. The Petitioner contends"
"that the failure to include these suspects undermines and invalidates the indictment and the"
"related proceedings."
"The  Petitioner  further  highlights  that  during  proceedings  before  the  High  Court,  the  State"
"Counsel  informed  the  Court  that  all  investigations  have  been  concluded.  However,  on"
"03.07.2024,  the  High  Court  Judge  noted  difficulties  in  getting  the  main  docket  of  the"
"Magistrate’s  Court  Case 
forwarded  due 
to 
the  purported  ongoing 
investigations.  The"
"Petitioner contends that once an indictment is filed in the High Court, the Magistrate’s Court"
