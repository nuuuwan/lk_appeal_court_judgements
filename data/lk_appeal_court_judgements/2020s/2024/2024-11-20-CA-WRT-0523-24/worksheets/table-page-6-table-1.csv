"Hon.  Attorney  General,  Inspector  General  of  Police,  Ajith  Nivard  Cabral  and  others,  CA"
"/WRIT/417/2021 decided on 03.11.2021."
"Even  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  placing  reliance  on  the  judgment  of  the  said"
"Sandresh Ravindra Karunanayake case submitted that none of the grounds of the Petitioner"
"that  challenge  the  prosecutorial  discretion  of  the  Attorney  General  would  fall  within  the"
"guidelines enunciated in the said Sandresh Ravindra Karunanayake case. Thus, I take the view"
"that the issues in the instant Application on the said indictment can be effectively addressed"
"by applying the guidelines established by the Court of Appeal in the referenced case to assess"
"whether the Attorney General exercised prosecutorial discretion lawfully and without malice."
"A party could challenge the decision of the Attorney General to forward an indictment if such"
"decision falls within any of the limbs of the criteria enunciated therein."
"Therefore, the following guidelines formulated in the said Sandresh Ravindra Karunanayake"
"case, in my view, are fit and proper to be applied in assessing such prosecutorial discretion of"
"the Attorney General in the instant Application;"
