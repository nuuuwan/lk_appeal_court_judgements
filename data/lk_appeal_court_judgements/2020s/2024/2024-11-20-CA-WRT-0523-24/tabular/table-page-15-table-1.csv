"making process or when the Attorney General has acted beyond his jurisdiction. This should"
"be assayed and evaluated while giving due consideration to the guidelines discussed above."
"In  the  circumstances,  I  am  unable  to  hold  that  the  Attorney  General  in  exercising  his"
"discretion acted in bad faith or with an ulterior motive or in excess of his powers. Thus, I take"
"the view that there is no reason to interfere with the prosecutorial discretion exercised by the"
"Attorney General in relation to the impugned indictment or the detention order issued by the"
"2nd Respondent. I strongly believe that all the purported allegations raised against the Attorney"
"General by the Petitioner can be easily dealt with during the proceedings in the High Court,"
"if the Petitioner so wishes, as no intervention of a Review Court is required at this stage to"
"review any such contentions of the Petitioner."
"This Court has consistently dealt with arguability principles in applications for judicial review"
"and held that the vitiating ground must be arguably material to the impugned decision and"
"such  decision  must  be  arguably  amenable  to  judicial  review.  Thus,  I  hold  that  there  is  no"
"arguable case or a prima facie case which warrants this Court to issue formal notice of the"
"instant Application on the Respondents. Therefore, I refuse the instant Application."
"Application is refused."
