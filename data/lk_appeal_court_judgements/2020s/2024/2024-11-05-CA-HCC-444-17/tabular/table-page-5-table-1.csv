the  village  Funeral  Donation  Society  and  obtained  a 
loan  of"
"Rs.50,000/- and had handed over the money to the Appellant at his office in"
"the presence of her son-in-law PW2 on 26.12.2007."
"As the Appellant had failed to secure a government employment for PW2 as"
"promised, she had requested the money back from the Appellant. She had"
"made  this  request  as  her  financial  situation  had  further  deteriorated.  The"
"Appellant had issued a cheque for Rs.50,000/- without retuning the money"

"presented

relevant  bank
