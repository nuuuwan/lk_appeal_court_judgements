"The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider;"
"1. that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  prove  the  case  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt."
"2. That the evidence which was led at the trial is insufficient to make an"
"order of conviction."
"3. that the evidence of the Appellant had not been given any consideration"
"by the learned High Court Judge."
"4. that the learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence"
"for  the  prosecution  taking  into  consideration  the  obvious  infirmities"
"and contradictions in his judgment."
"5. that  the  failure  on  the  part  of  the  trial  judge  to  consider  the  date  of"
"commission of the offence is conduct which reflects partial bias on the"
"part of the High Court Judge."
"6. that  the  Judge  who  wrote  the  judgment  had  failed  to  observe  the"
"demeanour and deportment of the witnesses."
