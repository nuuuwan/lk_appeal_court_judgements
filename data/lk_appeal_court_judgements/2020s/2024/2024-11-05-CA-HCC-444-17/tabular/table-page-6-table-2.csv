"167 citing Jayasena V the Queen 72 NLR Page 313, Held that;"
"“ ………..A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is"
"to  consider  all  the  matters  before  the  Court  adduced  whether  by  the"
"prosecution or by the defence in its totality without compartmentalising"
"and, ask himself whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the"
"particular case, he believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty"
"- see the Privy Council Judgment in Jayasena v The Queen.”"
