"184 the court held that;"
"(1) “It  is  necessary  for  a  succeeding  Judge  to  continue  proceedings  since"
"there  are change of Judges holding office in  a particular Court due  to"
"transfers,  promotions  and  the  like.  It  is  in  these  circumstances  that"
"Section 48 was amended giving discretion to a Judge to continue with"
"the proceedings."
"(2) The exercise of such discretion should not be disturbed unless there are"
"serious issues with regard to the demeanour of any witnesses recorded"
"by the Judge who previously heard the case”."
