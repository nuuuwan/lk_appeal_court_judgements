"High Court Judge had been satisfied with the credibility of the witnesses who"
"had given evidence on behalf of the prosecution."
"In this case the evidence presented by the prosecution is overwhelming. No"
"contradictory position existed among the prosecution witnesses. The learned"
"High Court Judge had considered the inter se and per se contradictions of"
"prosecution  witnesses  and  held  that  the  prosecution  had  adduced  cogent,"
"consistent, and believable evidence. Therefore, I conclude that the grounds"
"of appeal raised by the Appellant have no merit."
"When considering the totality of the evidence, it is clear that the prosecution"
"has  proven  the  charges  in  the  indictment  against  the  Appellant  beyond"
"reasonable doubt."
"Therefore, the appeal is dismissed, and the conviction and the sentence are"
"affirmed."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Colombo along with the original case record."
