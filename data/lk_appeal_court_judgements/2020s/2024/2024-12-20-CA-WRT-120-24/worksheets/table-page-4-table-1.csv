"to be quashed in a Writ Application. It  was  also argued that the Petitioner has failed to"
"demonstrate that the award is ultra vires."
"T
his Court will now consider the Petitioner’s submissions with the objections raised by the"
"6th Respondent."
"T
he  Petitioner  contends  that  the  6th  Respondent’s  work  was  not  satisfactory  during  the"
"period he was a trainee. In the light of this submission this Court observes that as per the"
"submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, the Petitioner had the right to either"
"extend the probation period for a further 6 months or to terminate his services at the end of"
"the contract period for unsatisfactory work. The contract of the 6th Respondent is marked"
"as P1. Yet, in 1994 by the document marked as P5, the Petitioner went a step further and"
"appointed the 6th Respondent to a permanent post as a “Billing Trainee”. Subsequently, by"
"a letter dated 11.07.2002, he had been promoted to a Grade III Revenue Officer with effect"
"from  01.01.2001  and  posted  on  the  salary  scales  of  A3.  The  Petitioner  contended  that"
"thereafter he was subsequently promoted (P15)."
"T
his Court observes that the learned Counsel for the Petitioner took great pain to impress"
"upon Court that the 6th Respondent’s work was unsatisfactory and he could not have been"
"placed on the salary scale of A5 but the Petitioner failed to explain the reason as to why"
"the  6th  Respondent  was  promoted  if  his  work  was  so  unsatisfactory  when  the  option  to"
"terminate the service was available."
"D
ispute before the Arbitrator"
"A
s shown in the document marked as P16, an arbitrator had been appointed and the said"
"dispute was referred for arbitration under the IDA. The said referral is marked as P17. The"
"dispute referred to states as follows;"
"“Whether Mr. K.K.W.R. Kariyawasam is entitled for the post of Revenue Officer"
"and  if  so,  to  what  relief  from  which  period  and  whether  he  has  been  caused"
"injustice  by  being  appointed  to  the  post  of  Revenue  Officer-  Grade  III  from"
"01.01.2001 and being appointed grade wise and if so, to what relief is he entitled.”"
