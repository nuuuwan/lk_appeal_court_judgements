"Moreover,  although  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  cited  Section  48C  in  his"
"written submission13, it is important to note that this provision was introduced"
"by Amendment Act No. 18 of 2013, effective from 1st April 2013. The year of"
"assessment in issue is 2011/2012, covering 1st April 2011 to 31st March 2012."
"Consequently,  Section  48C  is  not  applicable  to  the  issue  at  hand  and  I  am"
"displeased and completely puzzled why it was cited."
"Additionally, the introduction of this provision through an amendment indicates"
"that a more burdensome tax than that under the IR Act could have been imposed"
"by  an  agreement,  prior  to  the  amendment.  Nonetheless,  these  arguments  hold"
"only if the Appellant is eligible for the concessionary tax rate under Section 13"
"(ddd) of the IR Act."
"The Appellant also brought forth the following arguments."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  submitted  in  his  written"
"submissions the following extract form the judgement of His Lordship Sripavan"
"J.,  (as  His  Lordship  then  was)  in  Vallibel  Lanka  (Pvt)  Limited  v.  Director  -"
"General of Customs14;"
"‘It is the established rule in the interpretation of statutes levying taxes and duties,"
"not to extend the provisions of the statute by implication, beyond the clear import"
"of the language used or to enlarge their operation in order to embrace matters"
"not specifically pointed out. In case of doubt, the provisions are construed most"
"strongly against the state and in favour of the citizen thus, the intention to impose"
"duties and/or taxes on imported goods must be shown by clear and ambiguous"
"words.  (….)    One  must  have  regard  to  the  strict  letter  of  the  law  and  cannot"
"import  provisions  in  the  Customs  Ordinance  so  as  to  supply  any  assumed"
"deficiency.’"
