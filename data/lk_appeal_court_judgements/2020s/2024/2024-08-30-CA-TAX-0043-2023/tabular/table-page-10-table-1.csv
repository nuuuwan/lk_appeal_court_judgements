"The learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant also cited several judgments15"
"and a reference from Maxwell on the 'Interpretation of Statutes16,' arguing that"
"in matters of taxation, it has to be looked simply at what is clearly said and there"
"is no room for any intendment; there is no equity about a tax. If the person sought"
"to be taxed comes within the letter of the law, he must be taxed, however great"
"the  hardship  may  appear  to  the  judicial  mind  to  be.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the"
"crown seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the"
"law, the subject is free."
"It  was  also  argued  that  if  a  provision  is  reasonably  capable  of  two  alternative"
"interpretations, Courts  will prefer  the interpretation that  is more favourable to"
"the taxpayer17."
"However,  in  this  case,  there  are  no  such  alternative  meanings  to  consider  in"
"interpreting  Section  13(ddd)  and  the  provisions  of  the  agreement.  Similarly,"
"there is no ambiguity in either the statutory provision or the agreement. The task"
"before  this  Court  is  to  determine  whether  the  Appellant  is  entitled  to  the  tax"
"exemption under Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act or whether the Appellant is liable"
"to pay tax according to the relevant provisions of the agreement."
"Based on the above analysis, I conclude that the Appellant is not eligible for the"
"tax exemption under Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act and is required to pay taxes"
"as stipulated in the agreement with the BOI."
"(ii) Is the Appellant’s interest income, which is less than 5 million, is liable"
"to income tax at the rate of 12% under and in terms of Part B of the Second"
"Schedule of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)?"
