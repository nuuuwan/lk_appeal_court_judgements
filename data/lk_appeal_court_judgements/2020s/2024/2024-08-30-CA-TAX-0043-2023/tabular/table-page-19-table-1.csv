"considered an ""alter ego"" of the Minister, and the officer's decisions are treated"
"as if they were made by the Minister himself."
"This  principle  was  applied 
in 
the  case  of  Kuruppu  v.  Keerthi  Rajapakse,"
"Conservator of Forests,24 wherein Rodrigo, J. quoted the following passage from"
"De Smith’s Judicial Review of Administrative Action25."
"“Special considerations arise where a statutory power vested in a Minister or a"
"department of State is exercised by a department official. The official is the alter"
"ego of the Minister or the Department and since he is subject of as to the fullest"
"control by his superior, he is not usually spoken of as a delegate… The Courts"
"have  recognized  that  duties  imposed  on  Ministers  and  the  powers  given  to"
"Ministers  are  normally  exercised  under 
the  authority  of 
the  Ministers  by"
"responsible officials of the department……… In general, therefore, a Minister is"
"not  obliged  to  bring  his  own  mind  to  bear  upon  a  matter  entrusted  to  him  by"
"statutes, but act through a duly authorized officer of his department.”"
"In the recent past Courts have further extended the doctrine ‘Carltona principle’."
"In  the  case  of  R.  (Chief  Constable  of  West  Midlands  Police)  v.  Birmingham"
"Justices.26  Sedley LJ. held that;"
"“There was a distinction to be drawn between ‘those offices which are the apex"
"of an organisation itself composed of office-holders or otherwise hierarchically"
"structured, and those offices designated by Parliament because of the personal"
"qualifications  of  the  individual  holder’27.  In  the  former  case  the  subordinate"
"officers could act on behalf of their superior to whom Parliament had granted"
"the power and who would take legal responsibility for its exercise. In the latter"
"only the officer actually empowered could act.”"
"The  CGIR’s  role  is  defined  by  the  hierarchical  structure  established  by  the"
"statute,  rather  than  by  his  personal  qualifications.  Given  the  many  significant"
