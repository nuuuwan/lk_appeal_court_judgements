"An English case, which set a milestone in respect of what was referred"
"to as “unfettered discretion” is Padfield and others vs. The Minister"
"of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, [1968] A. C. 997. In short, the"
"dispute was in respect of the request of South Eastern dairy farmers"
"that  the  existing  “differential”  was  too  low.  That  was  an  additional"
"payment  made  to  balance  the  cost  incurred  by  dairy  farmers  in  two"
"different  areas,  especially  in  transport.  They  complained  to  the  Milk"
"Marketing Board and as they could not persuade that, to the minister."
"The latter refused to refer the complaint to the committee. This was the"
"grievance of the dairy farmers when they came to the Divisional Court"
"of  the  Queen’s  Bench  Division,  which  held  with  them.  The  minister"
"appealed. In the Court of Appeal, the dairy farmers lost. They had only"
"the  support  of  Lord  Denning  M.  R.  in  a  minority.  The  dairy  farmers"
"appealed. They won in the House of Lords."
