"","“But  there  is  one  difference  between  those  Articles  [Articles  17  and"
"","126] and Article 140. Article 140 (unlike Article 126) is ""subject to the"
"","provisions of the Constitution"". Is that enough to reverse the position,"
"","so  as  to  make  article  140  subject  to  the  written  laws  which  Article"
"","168(1) keeps in force? Apart from any other consideration, if it became"
"","necessary  to  decide  which  was  to  prevail  -  an  ouster  clause  in  an"
"","ordinary law or a Constitutional provision conferring writ jurisdiction"
"","on a Superior Court, ""subject to the provisions of the Constitution"" - I"

the 
latter  prevails,  because 
the"
"presumption  must  always  be","in 
favour  of  a 
jurisdiction  which"
"","enhances  the  protection  of  the  Rule  of  Law,  and  against  an  ouster"
"","clause  which  tends  to  undermine  it  (see  also  Jailabdeen  v.  Danina"
"","Umma (13)). But no such presumption is needed, because it is clear"
"","that  the  phrase  ""subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution""  was"
"necessary 
to 
avoid 
conflicts","between  Article 
140 
and 
other"
"","Constitutional provisions - such as Article 80(3), 120, 124, 125, and"
"126(3).  That  phrase","refers  only 
to  contrary  provisions 
in 
the"
"","Constitution itself, and does not extend to provisions of other written"
"","laws, which are kept alive by Article 168(1). Where the Constitution"
"","contemplated that its provisions may be restricted by the provisions"
"of Article 138 which is subject to ""any law"".",""
