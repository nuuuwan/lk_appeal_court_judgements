"The petitioners further state at paragraph 73 and 74 as follows,"
"“73. Thus, it is respectfully submitted that as at 22.12.2008, (which is"
"the date on which the Petitioners seek ante dating) all the Petitioners have"
"already faced the Limited Competitive Examination and from 22.12.2008"
"to 22.06.2009, all the Petitioners have been in active service in planning"
"related  works  in  referent  Ministries,  Government  Department  and/or"
"Provincial Councils. Thus, the said Antedating does not give validity period"
"to a period where the Petitioners were not in service or for a period in a"
"vacuum, but on the contrary during the said Period the Petitioners were"
"all in active service."
"74.  It  is  further  submitted  with  great  respect,  that  another  argument"
"advanced by the 13th to 233rd Respondents are to the effect that, there is"
"no hard and fast rule of placing the candidates under the Limited Category"
"being placed above the candidates of the Open Category”."
