"","“When the Court has examined the record and is satisfied that the Order"
"","complained  of  is  manifestly  erroneous  or  without  jurisdiction  the  Court"
"","would be loathe to allow the mischief of the order to continue and reject"
"","the  application  simply  on  the  ground  of  delay,  unless  there  are  very"
"extraordinary  reasons  to","justify  such  rejection.  Where  the  authority"
"","concerned has been acting altogether without basic jurisdiction, the Court"
"","may grant relief in spite of the delay unless the conduct of the party shows"
"","that he has approbated the usurpation of jurisdiction. In any such event,"
"","the  explanation  of  the  delay  should  be  considered  sympathetically."""
