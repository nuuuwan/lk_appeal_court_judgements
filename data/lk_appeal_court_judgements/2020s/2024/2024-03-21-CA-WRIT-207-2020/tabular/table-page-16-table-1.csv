"â€œDUTY TO EXERCISE JURISDICTION"
"A court or tribunal has a public duty to hear and decide any case within"
"its jurisdiction which is properly brought before it. A mandatory order"
"is frequently granted to enforce this duty on the part of inferior courts"
"and  statutory  tribunals  which  are  ordered  to  hear  and  determine"
"according to law. Thus magistrates, licensing justices, county courts,"
"statutory  tribunals,  ministers,  officials,  university  visitors,  and  other"
"jurisdictions subject to the High Court can be prevented from refusing"
"jurisdiction  wrongfully.  In  R  v.  Briant,  a  county  court  judge,  who"
"mistakenly declined to hear an action for possession by mortgagees on"
"the ground that the county court had no jurisdiction, was ordered to"
"hear  and  determine  the  case  on  a  mandatory  order  from  (what  was"
"then) the Queen's Bench Division."" The same happened when a county"
"court judge refused to investigate the correctness of jurisdictional facts"
"upon  which  the  validity  of  a  rent  tribunal's  decision  depended  and"
"which were properly disputed  before him. Finally, a mandatory order"
"was issued when a minister declined to decide an appeal about public"
"rights of way. Refusal to receive evidence on some relevant point may"
"also  amount  to  refusal  of  jurisdiction.  In  these  cases,  a  mandatory"
"order can be issued to compel a magistrate to receive it. This situation,"
"however,  has  to  be  distinguished  from  a  decision  by  the  magistrate,"
"within the scope of their discretion, that the evidence is irrelevant."
