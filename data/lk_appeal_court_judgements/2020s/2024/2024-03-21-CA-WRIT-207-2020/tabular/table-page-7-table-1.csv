"protection of the Rule of Law, and against an ouster clause which tends"
"to undermine it (see also Jailabdeen v. Danina Umma (13)). But no such"
"presumption is needed, because it is clear that the phrase ""subject to the"
"provisions of the Constitution"" was necessary to avoid  conflicts between"
"Article  140  and  other  Constitutional  provisions  -  such  as  Article  80(3),"
"120, 124, 125, and 126(3). That phrase refers only to contrary provisions"
"in the Constitution itself, and does not extend to provisions of other written"
"laws,  which  are  kept  alive  by  Article  168(1).  Where  the  Constitution"
"contemplated  that  its  provisions  may  be  restricted  by  the  provisions  of"
"Article 138 which is subject to ""any law""."
