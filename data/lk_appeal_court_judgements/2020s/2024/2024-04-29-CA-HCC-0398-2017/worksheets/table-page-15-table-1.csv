"I am in no position to agree with such a contention, as the evidence led in the"
"case completely removes the possibility of a 3rd party being involved in the crime."
"The evidence clearly shows that there had been no possibility for an intruder to"
"get into the boarding room and commit such a gruesome act. The only inference"
"that can be reached based on the circumstantial evidence available against the"
"appellant is that, it was he who committed the crime and no one else."
"For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the grounds of appeal"
"urged by the appellant have no merit."
"Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed."
"The conviction and the sentence of the appellant is affirmed."
