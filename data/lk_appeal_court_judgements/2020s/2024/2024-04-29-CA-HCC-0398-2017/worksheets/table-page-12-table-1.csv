"However, on 19-12-2007, the deceased has come home and informed her parents"
"that her husband wanted her to bring Rs.50,000/-, a demand which he could"
"not fulfill. On that day, his daughter has informed him that she came home after"
"a  quarrel  with  the  appellant.  Although  he  has  given  evidence  in  Court  saying"
"that his daughter left the house on the 19th, whereas he has stated that she left"
"on the 21st in his statement to the police, the fact that she left her home on the"
"21st  has  been  established  without  doubt,  as  the  sister  of  the  victim  has  given"
"clear evidence in that regard."
"The sister (PW-09) of the deceased, being the elder sister, has had much better"
"contact with her sister and her husband, the appellant. The appellant has visited"
"her  house  along  with  the  deceased  after  their  marriage.  She  has  visited  the"
"boarding several times because of the disputes the deceased and the appellant"
"had in their married life, and she had even visited the deceased at the hospital"
"when she was undergoing treatment as a result of an assault by the appellant."
"She has come to know that the appellant was a married person with a child, and"
"as  a  result  of  that,  there  had  been  quarrels  between  the  appellant  and  the"
"deceased. She has met her sister for the last time when she came home on 19-"
"12-2007. She has even spoken to the appellant over the phone informing that"
"due to their poverty, they cannot afford to give Rs.50,000/- to the deceased."
"According  to  her  evidence,  after  the  deceased  left  the  house  on  the  21st,  the"
"appellant has given a call to her informing that she reached the boarding. The"
"evidence of the sister of the deceased clearly establishes the fact that although"
"she  and  her  other  family  members  wanted  her  to  abandon  the  appellant  and"
"come home,  the deceased  has refused,  stating that she wanted to be with the"
"appellant as he was the one who put her in this situation."
"The evidence taken as a whole clearly establishes the fact that the deceased has"
"become a nuisance to the appellant because of the strained relationship which"
"has  developed  between  them,  and  there  had  been  constant  quarrels  between"
"them."
