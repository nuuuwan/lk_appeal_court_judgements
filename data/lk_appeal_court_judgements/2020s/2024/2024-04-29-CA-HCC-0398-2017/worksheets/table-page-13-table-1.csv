"The owner of the boarding where the two  of them lived has seen the deceased"
"near the place where both the appellant and the deceased lived a day prior to"
"when her body was discovered. The house ownerâ€™s evidence establishes the fact"
"that there had been issues in their life as a married couple, and at one time, he"
"was forced to advise them not to quarrel and leave the place, if they cannot live"
"peacefully."
"It is clear from the judgment of the learned High Court Judge that since there"
"was no eyewitness account of the incident which led to the death of the deceased,"
"it  is  only  on  the  basis  of  circumstantial  evidence  that  the  evidence  has  been"
"considered."
"In  that  process,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  decided  to  disregard  the"
"alleged statement made by the appellant in terms of section 27(1) of the Evidence"
"Ordinance, as the evidence which led to the discovery of the knife was sketchy,"
"which has led to an uncertainty. I find that this determination has been reached"
"by  the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  being  very  well  mindful  of  the  relevant"
"considerations that should be given to such a finding. It is clear that the learned"
"High  Court  Judge  has  taken  all  the  pieces  of  circumstantial  evidence  in  its"
"totality."
"In the said process, the learned High Court Judge has taken the evidence of the"
"uncle of the appellant to whom the appellant has given a call informing that the"
"woman he is married to and lived with him, was dead. The response by the uncle"
"of the appellant had been to go and surrender to the police. As rightly considered"
"by the learned High Court Judge, there cannot be any reason for the uncle of the"
"appellant to inform him to surrender to police other than make a complaint to"
"the  police,  if  the  appellant  had  not  informed  more  than  what  the  witness  has"
"stated  in  the  Court.  This  was  an  inference  that  can  be  safely  drawn  from  the"
"evidence of the uncle of the appellant as a piece of circumstantial evidence that"
"can  be  considered  against  him.  The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has  well"
"considered the defence taken up by the appellant and has correctly determined"
