"evidence when taken separately may only be suspicious in nature."
"In the case of The King Vs. Gunaratne 47 NLR 145, it was held:"
"“In a case of circumstantial evidence, the facts given in evidence may, taken"
"cumulatively, be sufficient to rebut the presumption of innocence, although"
"each fact, when taken separately, may be a circumstance only of suspicion."
"The jury is entitled to draw inferences unfavourable to an accused where he"
"is not called to establish an innocent explanation of evidence given by the"
"prosecution, which, without such explanation, tells for his guilt.”"
