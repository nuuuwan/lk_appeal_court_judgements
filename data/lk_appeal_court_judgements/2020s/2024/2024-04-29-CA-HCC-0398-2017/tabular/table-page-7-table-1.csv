"Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal"
"As the grounds of appeal urged are interrelated, I will now proceed to consider"
"them collectively."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  contended  that  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge  has  raised  doubt  about  the  alleged  recovery  of  the  knife  based  on  a"
"statement made by the appellant and contended further that the circumstantial"
"evidence does not point towards the accused on the basis that it was only the"
"accused committed the offence."
"It was the position of the learned Counsel that the judgment does not say that"
"the  conviction  was  based  on  the  principles  of  circumstantial  evidence.  It  was"
"argued that the fact of both the appellant and the deceased living in the room"
"where the body was found, and the fact of the appellant giving a call to his uncle"
"are  not  incriminating  evidence  against  the  appellant  which  would  constitute"
"circumstantial  evidence  against  him.  It  was  submitted  that  the  learned  High"
"Court Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence on the basis of circumstantial"
"evidence  and  had  not  adequately  discussed  the  circumstantial  evidence  upon"
"which the conviction was based on."
"Referring to the ground of appeal where it was contended that an involvement of"
"a third party cannot be overruled, it was the position of the learned Counsel that"
"there had been several other boarding rooms around the room where the body"
"was discovered and the prosecution has failed to call PW-04 and 05 listed in the"
"indictment to eliminate any such possibility."
"Countering the submissions made on behalf of the appellant, the learned Senior"
"Deputy  Solicitor  General  (SDSG)  was  of  the  view  that  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge has considered the evidence on the basis of circumstantial evidence  by"
"being very mindful of the principles and the necessary ingredients that should"
"be established in a matter based on circumstantial evidence."
