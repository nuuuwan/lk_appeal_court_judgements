"The  defence  taken  up  by  the  appellant  has  not  created  any  doubt  as  to  the"
"evidence of the prosecution."
"Therefore, for the reasons considered as above, I find no merit in the grounds of"
"appeal urged on behalf of the appellant."
"Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit. The conviction and the"
"sentence affirmed."
