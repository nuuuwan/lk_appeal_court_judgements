"I  find  that  it  was  quite  probable  for  the  witnesses  led  by  Sergeant  Perera  to"
"pursue the appellant, stop her, and search her. According to the witnesses, when"
"they  stopped  her,  they  have  observed  that  she  was  holding  something  in  her"
"right-hand palm. Upon inspection, it has been found that she is having a film"
"roll container, which was something commonly available during that period as"
"digital camera technology was rare at that time. Such a container is something"
"that a person can easily hold in the hand."
"The gross quantity of the substance found inside the container was 8.404 grams."
"Although  such  a  quantity  may  sound  small  nowadays,  in  the  year  2000,  this"
"would amount to a relatively large quantity of a dangerous drug."
"The evidence of the witnesses as to the place of residence of the appellant is very"
"much probable as against the contention of the appellant, where she states that"
"police officers came to her house and arrested her after finding the drug hidden"
"in the thicket."
"I do not see any probability in the version of events taken up by the appellant,"
"as I do not find any reason for a drug trafficker to hide a drug in a thicket after"
"putting it in a small container. I do not find any reason for the police party to"
"accuse the appellant if she was innocently inside her mother’s house when the"
"detection took place on the road."
"I do not find any basis to conclude that the police party went to the appellant’s"
"house based on a petition received by them. The evidence led in the case does"
"not suggest any basis to believe that receiving a petition was the reason for this"
"raid. The evidence has clearly established that the detection had been while the"
"police officers were engaged in vice prevention duties, and not having conducted"
"a planned raid in relation to the appellant."
"For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the evidence of the"
"prosecution witnesses was quite probable, cogent and trustworthy."
