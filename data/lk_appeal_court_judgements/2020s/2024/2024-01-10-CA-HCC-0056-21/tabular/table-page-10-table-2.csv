"In the case of King Vs Chalo Singho 42 NLR 269, Soertsz, J. stated,"
"“It must, therefore, be regarded as well-established law, that a prosecutor"
"is not bound to call all the witnesses on the indictment or to tender them for"
"cross-examination.  That  is  a  matter  in  his  discretion.  But  in  exceptional"
"circumstances, a Judge might interfere to ask him to call a witness or to call"
"a witness as a witness of the Court.”"
