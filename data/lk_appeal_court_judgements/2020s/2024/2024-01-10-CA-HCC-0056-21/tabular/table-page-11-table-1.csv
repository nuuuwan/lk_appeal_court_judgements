"a jury that the failure to call such witness give rise to a presumption under"
"section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance.‚Äù"
"In  the  appeal  under  consideration,  it  is  not  that  the  prosecution  has  called  a"
"single witness to prove their case. Two police officers who took part in the raid"
"has been called by the prosecution. The mentioned WPC2686 Sandya is not  a"
"listed witness in the indictment. It is clear from the evidence of the witnesses"
"that her contribution to the actual detection was very minimal. When Sergeant"
"Perera wanted the appellant to open her palm and show what she was carrying,"
"initially she has hesitated, it had been the evidence of the witnesses that it was"
"with reluctance that the appellant agreed to open the palm."
"According to the evidence of PW-04, WPC Sandya has assisted Sergeant Perera"
"to persuade the appellant to open her palm. Subsequent to the discovery of the"
"reel  container,  WPC  Sandya  has  searched  the  appellant  which  was  an  action"
"done after the actual detection was made."
"As I have considered before, her evidence does not constitute a missing link in"
"the evidence of the prosecution. I find no basis to conclude that not calling WPC"
"Sandya amounts to creating a suspicion as to the detection made by the police."
"I am of the view that the probability of an incident as narrated by witnesses has"
"to be considered by taking the evidence, be it of the prosecution or the defence,"
"in its totality, and not by taking portions of evidence in its isolation."
"When considering the evidence of the prosecution as a whole, it is clear that they"
"have gone near the place where the detection was made to look for hidden illicit"
"liquor in a thicket behind the railway station. Although they were in civics, the"
"fact that they were police officers may have been visible to any onlookers because"
"of  what  they  were  doing  at  that  time.  Under  such  circumstances,  the  police"
"officers being trained and experienced officers in observing people, it was very"
"much possible for witnesses to suspect the appellant in the way she is alleged to"
"have behaved when passing the police officers who were looking for illicit liquor."
