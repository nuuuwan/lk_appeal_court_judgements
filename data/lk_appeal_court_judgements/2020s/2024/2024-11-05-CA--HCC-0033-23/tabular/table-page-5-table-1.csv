"“It is rare that a decision of a Judge so express, so explicit, upon a point"
"of fact purely, is over-ruled by a Court of Appeal, because the Courts of"
"Appeal recognize the priceless advantage which a judge of first instance"
"has in matters of that kind, as contrasted with any Judge of a Court of"
"Appeal,  who  can  only  learn  from  paper  or  narrative  of  those  who  were"
"present.  It  is  very  rare  that,  in  questions  of  veracity  so  direct  and  so"
"specific  as  these,  a  Court  of  Appeal  will  over  rule  a  Judge  of 
first"
"instance.”"
"In Alwis vs Piyasena Fernando SC NO. 30/92, his Lordship Justice GPS de"
"Silva CJ stated thus:"
"“It is well established that findings of primary facts by a trial Judge who"
"hears and sees witnesses are not to be lightly on appeal.”"
"It was further held in the case of The Republic of Sri Lanka v Thimbirigolle"
"Sirirathana Thero CA 194/2015,"
"“It  is  the  trial  judge  who  has  the  opportunity  to  observe  the  demeanor"
"and deportment of the witness who testifies before him”"
"Hence the above quoted cases clearly demonstrate as to why a trial judge, who"
"sits  down  to  write  the 
judgment,  must  have  the  opportunity  to  hear  the"
"witnesses in the witness box. But in the instant matter the learned High Court"
"Judge  who  delivered  the  judgement  had  not  heard  a  single  witness,  and  the"
"impact  of  this  is  made  worse  when  the  witness  in  question  had  not  been"
"consistent."
"Therefore,  it  is  the  opinion  of  this  court  that  the  victim  in  the  instant  matter"
"had not been a cogent and a credible witness. The learned judge who delivered"
"the judgement had failed to see this and he has in fact in one single stroke of"
"the pen, said that the contradictions and the omissions in the evidence of the"
"victim do not go to the root of the case."
