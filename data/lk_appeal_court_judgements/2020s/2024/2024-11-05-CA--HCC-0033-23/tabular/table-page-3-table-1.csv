"omissions,  which  had  been  brought  to  the  notice  of  the  court.  Hence,  her"
"evidence had been inconsistent and varying. (pages 79 and 78 of the brief)"
"At page 89 of the brief she had admitted to Court that she had lied. Hence her"
"evidence in totality is very confusing and vacillating."
"Thereafter, the prosecution had led the evidence of witness number 5, who had"
"been  a  person  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  victim  and  the  appellant.  He  had"
"made a statement on 05.05.2008. According to his testimony, he had seen the"
"victim  running  in  and  out  of  the  house  of  the  appellant  and  he  had  informed"
"the sister of the victim. He had been lengthily cross examined, but apparently"
"had not known as to what had happened inside the house of the appellant. He"
"too is not very precise in stating as to what he had seen but this witness had"
"been contradicted by the victim, as pointed out above."
"Thereafter, the prosecution had led the evidence of PW-04 who was the sister of"
"the  victim.  This  particular  witness  had  been  told  by  the  earlier  witness  of  a"
"possible incident and thereafter, the victim also had told her. According to her,"
"the victim had been hiding inside the jungle and she had to be found by these"
"people, but on further examination it had transpired that it was not a jungle as"
"envisaged by the real meaning of a jungle but the shrubbery in her garden. She"
"too  had  been  cross  examined  and  she  had  taken  a  different  position.  In  the"
"police statement she had not stated that the victim told her that the appellant"
"raped  her.  Hence  the  evidence  of  the  sister  also  is  contradictory  inter  se  and"
"per se."
"Thereafter, the prosecution had led the evidence of the judicial medical officer,"
"who  had  examined 
the  victim.  The  doctor  had  examined 
the  victim  on"
"08.05.2008 and at the time of examination, her age had been noted as thirteen"
"years. The history given to the doctor is what she had said in evidence-in-chief"
"in  court,  and  the  doctor  had  said  that  on  the  observations  he  made  of  the"
"victim,  he  cannot  rule  out  the  case  history.  The  doctor  had  not  been  cross"
"examined by the defence."
"The evidence of the investigating officers had also been led."
"Upon the closure of the prosecution case the defence had been called and the"
"appellant had given evidence on oath. He had said on oath that the victim had"
"been  one  of  his  neighbours  and  he  had  said  that  he  was  implicated  for  the"
"instant  offence  because  of  a  monetary  transaction.  He  had  been 
lengthily"
"cross-examined  but  he  had  stood 
the 
test  of  cross  examination  without"
"creating any contradiction or omission with his statement to the police."
