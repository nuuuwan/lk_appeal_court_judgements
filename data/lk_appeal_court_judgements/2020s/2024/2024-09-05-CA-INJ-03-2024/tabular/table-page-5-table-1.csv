"the Respondents informed the court that they intended to appoint an arbitrator.  It cannot be"
"disputed  that  the  Petitioner,  in  his  capacity  as  the  Zone  Developer,  made  a  commitment  to"
"invest a considerable amount of money in the project for its entire duration."
"This court recognizes that the dispute at hand arises from the Development and Management"
"Agreement dated 30th of August 2021, which includes a binding arbitration clause mandating"
"that any conflicts be resolved through arbitration. It is understood that arbitration will serve"
"as the ultimate mechanism for the resolution of this matter."
"However,  as  alleged  there  is  a  reasonable  suspicion  that  the  Respondents  are  currently"
"engaging in attempts to modify the existing agreements with investors in a manner that would"
"permit  these  investors  to  exit  the  Zone  entirely.  In  light  of  these  actions  which  pose  a"
"significant  risk  of  causing  irreparable  harm  and  fundamentally  altering  the  status  quo,  this"
"court finds it necessary to intervene to preserve the current conditions and prevent any further"
"irreparable damage until the arbitration process can be properly convened and conducted."
"Therefore,  we  grant  the  injunction  as  prayed  for  in  prayer  ‘b’  of  the  petition  dated  15th  of"
"March  2024.  It  shall  remain  in  effect  for  a  period  of  three  months  from  the  date  of  this"
"judgment, or until the commencement of arbitration proceedings, whichever occurs first. The"
"court emphasizes that this order is issued to preserve the status quo of the subject matter and"
"to ensure that the arbitration process can proceed without hindrance."
