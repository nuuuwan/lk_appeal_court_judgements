"Sobhitha Rajakaruna J."
"The Petition and the Affidavit of the Petitioner have been filed in the Registry of the Court of"
"Appeal at 08.39 a.m. on 05.08.2024 as per the rubber stamp which appears on the motion by"
"which the Petition dated 05.08.2024 has been  tendered to  the Registry of this Court. Two"
"courier  receipts  dated  05.08.2024  issued  by  Prompt  Xpress  (Pvt)  in  Ratmalana  are  also"
"annexed  to  the  set  of  documents  filed  on  05.08.2024.  Apart  from  the  said  Petition  and"
"Affidavit,  the  Petitioner  has  filed  another  motion  annexing  a  document  marked  ‘X’  at"
"08:39a.m. on the same date; 05.08.2024."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  sent  the  docket  relating  to  the  instant  Application  with  an"
"endorsement  made  by  His  Lordship  the  President  of  the  Court  of  Appeal,  directly  to  the"
"Bench while the proceedings of this Court were in progress on 05.08.2024. The reasons for"
"forwarding the docket to Court in such an expeditious manner are not known to this Court."
"However, it needs to be stressed that in view of Notice No. 01/2024 of the Court of Appeal"
"issued by His Lordship the President of the Court of Appeal, all new applications filed on"
"extremely urgent basis will be accommodated at the discretion of the presiding Judge of the"
"relevant court and may be mentioned on a desired day only if such application is duly filed"
"(with proof of dispatch of notice to the Respondents) at least before  10.00 a.m on the day"
"before such desired date."
"It is pertinent to note that the 1st Respondent has been named as the Officer-in-Charge of the"
"public complaints division of the Criminal Investigations Department (‘CID’) whereas, the"
"2nd  Respondent  is  a  private  individual.  I  have  noticed  a  recent  trend  where  the  Attorney"
"General is not being made a party in Review Applications filed in this Court that seek orders"
"to prevent arrests. I believe this practice has led to significant delays in bringing the relevant"
"public  or  police  officers  to  court  to  address  matters  related  to  the  writ  applications.  This"
"situation  ultimately  benefits  the  Petitioners,  allowing  them  to  seek  interim  relief,  such  as"
"preventing arrests, without the Respondents being present in Court. Such a practice cannot"
"be endorsed to legitimize ex parte applications for interim orders and it affects the best interest"
"of justice."
