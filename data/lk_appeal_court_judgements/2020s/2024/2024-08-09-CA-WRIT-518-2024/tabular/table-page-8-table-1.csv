"I see there is no reason to interfere with the discretion of the CID for the investigation process"
"as  there  is  no  blatant  error  made  by  the  1st  Respondent  or  the  CID  by  issuing  the  notices"
"marked  ‘P11a’  and  ‘P11d’  and  prima  facie,  no  evidence  is  available  to  show  that  the  1st"
"Respondent or the CID have exceeded their powers."
"In  light  of  the  above,  I  am  not  inclined  to  issue  an  interim  relief  at  this  stage  due  to  the"
"unreasonable  delay  on  the  part  of  the  Petitioner  and  failure  of  the  Petitioner  to  establish"
"reasonable grounds for not duly serving notices of the instant Application on the Respondents."
"In summary, the Petitioner has not acted with due diligence, utmost transparency and good"
"faith to avoid any abuse of the process of the Court when making an application for interim"
"relief as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition."
"However,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  cumulative  effect  of  all  the  circumstances  and  the"
"consequences of the events taken place after filing the above ‘B’ Report will have to be taken"
"into consideration when a person complains to the Review Court especially of an imminent"
"threat of arrest. Hence, I take the view that an order on the issuance of notice and interim"
"relief should be made after hearing the Attorney General, as I believe the full burden of abuse"
"of process of court cannot be shifted completely to a litigant personally who seeks an order to"
"prevent arrest. In light of the above, I decide to fix this Case for support on a date convenient"
"to this Court."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to forward a certified copy of this order to the Hon."
"Attorney General himself, enabling the Attorney General to take appropriate steps to assist"
"this Court in applications for stay orders/interim orders where no notices of such applications"
"have  been  duly  served  on  the  Attorney  General  or  the  respective  public  officer/  Inspector"
"General of Police"
