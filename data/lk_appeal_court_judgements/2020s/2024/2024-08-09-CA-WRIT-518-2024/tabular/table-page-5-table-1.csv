"It  is  important  to  bear  in  mind  that  this  is  a  Judicial  Review  Application.  Judicial  review"
"generally focuses on the decision-making process, not the decision itself and accordingly, the"
"role  of  this  Court  is  to  consider  whether  the  Respondents  have  exceeded  their  powers."
"Therefore, there should be a blatant error made by the Respondents executing their duties or"
"any abuse of power or authority in order to exercise the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court."
"The only relief sought by the Petitioner is a writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st Respondent"
"and/ or any officer acting under his direction from arresting the Petitioner on the ground that"
"he has committed any offense as set out/alleged in the ‘B’ Report filed in the said Magistrate’s"
"Court of Welisara. The Petitioner seeks the same relief even as an interim order to be operative"
"until  the  final  determination  of  the  instant  Application.  Therefore,  a  reasonable  question"
"arises as to what is the substantive relief the Petitioner seeks from this Review Court."
"Atkin LJ in R v Electricity Commissioners ex p London Electricity Joint Committee Co. [1920] Ltd"
"(1924) 1KD 171 at 206 has stated that he can see no difference in principle between Certiorari"
"and Prohibition, except that the latter may be invoked at an earlier stage."
"‘Although a prohibiting order was originally used to prevent tribunals from meddling with"
"cases over which they had no jurisdiction, it was equally effective, and equally often used, to"
"prohibit the execution of some decision already taken but ultra vires. So long as the tribunal"
"or administrative authority still had some power to exercise as a consequence of the wrongful"
"decision,  the  exercise  of  that  power  could  be  restrained  by  a  prohibiting  order.’1  (Vide  -"
"H.W.R.Wade  and  C.F.Forsyth,  Administrative  Law  [11th  Edition]  p.511).  Therefore,  I"
"take the view that Prohibiting Orders need to  be  linked with an alleged wrongful  decision"
"which is disclosed in the writ application."
"This Court has constantly decided that a decision made by an authority may be liable to be"
"quashed by  a quashing order if the said authority wholly or in part assumes a jurisdiction"
"which he does not have or exceeds that which he has or acts contrary to principles of natural"
"justice or pronounces an Award which is eminently irrational or unreasonable or is guilty of"
