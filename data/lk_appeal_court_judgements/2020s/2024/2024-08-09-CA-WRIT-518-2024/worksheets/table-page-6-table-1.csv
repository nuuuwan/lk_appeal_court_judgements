"an illegality2. The Petitioner has not provided any decision taken by the learned Magistrate"
"or the CID to arrest the Petitioner. The aforesaid ‘B’ Report filed in the Magistrate’s Court of"
"Welisara is not in active mode as no future date has been given to consider it and also the said"
"order of the High Court has not been read out in the Magistrate’s Court. The Petitioner filed"
"the instant Application after a lapse of over one month from the notice of the CID, marked"
"‘P11a’ and ‘P11d’."
"Moreover,  the learned  Magistrate has refused  the anticipatory bail application filed by the"
"Petitioner after considering the detailed observations (marked ‘X’ - annexed to the motion"
"dated 05.08.2024) provided by the CID. No Revision Application has been filed against the"
"said order of the leaned Magistrate refusing anticipatory Bail. As  such it is the Petitioner’s"
"burden 
to  establish 
that 
filling  a  Revision  Application  against 
the  decision 
to  refuse"
"anticipatory bail is not an adequate and efficacious remedy."
"The trite law is that there should be (a) a reasonable complaint, (b) credible information or (c)"
"a reasonable suspicion to arrest a person without a warrant. The said principle is embodied"
"in Section 32(1) (b) of the CCPA. Hence, based on the circumstances of this case, I am of the"
"view that it is not this Court but the prosecution or the learned Magistrate are the best persons"
"to  assay  the  document  marked  ‘P8’  by  which  the  Petitioner  has  borrowed  a  large  sum  of"
"money  from  the  2nd  Respondent  and  the  subsequent  conduct  of  the  Petitioner  who  has"
"admitted his liability by making part payments to the said 2nd Respondent. Similarly, it is in"
"the hands of the prosecution to ascertain whether credible information or reasonable suspicion"
"exists  against  the  Petitioner.  It  can  be  inferred  that  the 
learned  Magistrate  was 
likely"
"persuaded to believe that a reasonable suspicion exists regarding the Petitioner’s involvement"
"in an offence, based on the observations (‘X’) made by the CID. The document marked ‘P8’"
"cannot be considered as a reasonable commercial agreement upon which the Petitioner could"
"claim  alternative  remedies 
to  resolve 
the  disputes  between 
the  Petitioner  and 
the  2nd"
"Respondent.  The 
judicial  process  concerning 
judicial  review  must  be  approached  with"
"responsibility and should not be misused by filing Review Applications without merit, thereby"
