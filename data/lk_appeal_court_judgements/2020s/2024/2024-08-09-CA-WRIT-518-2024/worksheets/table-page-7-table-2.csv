"In  Johnston  Xaviour  Fernando  v.  C.  D.  Wickramaratne,","the  Inspector  General  of  Police"
"CA/WRIT/200/2022 Decided on 21.06.2022, I have decided as follows:",""
"","“When issuing interim orders, we are guided by the Rules of the Court of Appeal and by the"
"","principle  whether  the  Court’s  final  order  would,  if  the  Petitioner  is  successful,  be  rendered"
"","nugatory.  Judicial  Review  jurisdiction  is  not  a  discrete  part  of  our  legal  system  and  its  roots"
"","emerge from constitutional law which is enriched with constitutional theories. Although, there"
"","are classifications as civil law jurisdiction and the criminal law jurisdiction etc., when it comes"
"","to the concept of ‘Rule of Law’, there should be only one jurisdiction………………. In a broader"
"","sense, Rule of Law means that  Law is supreme and is  above every individual; no individual"
"whether if he is rich, poor, rulers or ruled etc. are above law and they should obey it.”",""
