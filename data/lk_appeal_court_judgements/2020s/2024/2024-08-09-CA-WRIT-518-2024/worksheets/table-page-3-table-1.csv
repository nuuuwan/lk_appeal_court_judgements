"The learned Counsel for the Petitioner on 05.08.2024 urged that the instant Application be"
"taken up for support and an interim order be issued preventing the arrest of the Petitioner."
"Respondents were absent and unrepresented on 05.08.2024. Anyhow, the learned Counsel"
"for the Petitioner expressed his consensus to Support the instant Application on 07.08.2024"
"after serving direct notices on the Respondents. I have serious doubts in the manner in which"
"the Petitioner has dispatched the notices of the instant Application on the Respondents via"
"courier before 08:39 a.m. on 05.08.2024."
"The grant of interim relief by Court of Appeal is dealt with in Clause 2 of the Court of Appeal"
"(Appellate  Procedure)  Rules  1990.  It  is  mandatory  that  every  application  for  a  stay  order,"
"interim injunction or other interim relief shall be made with notice to the adverse parties or"
"respondents that the applicant intends to apply for such interim relief. However, in terms of"
"Clause  2(1)  of  the  said  Rules,  an  interim  relief  may  be  granted  for  a  limited  period  not"
"exceeding  two  weeks,  although  such  notice  has  not  been  given  to  some  or  all  of  the"
"Respondents,"
