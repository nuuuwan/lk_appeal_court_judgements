"payment of compensation is made and the acquisition proceedings are"
"concluded.”"
"The extent of the land in dispute was approximately A1-R2-P31 (excluding 10"
"perches). The compensation awarded by the state was a sum of Rs. 160,000/."
"The  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  submits  that  the  said  compensation  was"
"calculated  in  accordance  with  the  market  value.  Since  the  Petitioners  are"
"vehemently  objecting  and  disputing  the  calculation,  the  onus  is  on  the"
"Respondents to establish the fact that the assessment of compensation was"
"in terms of Section 45 of the said Act, that is to say, on the market value, with"
"stong and cogent evidence.  It is pertinent to note that the Respondents totally"
"failed to adduce any evidence to substantiate the fact that the calculation was"
"on the market value. In the absence of any materials to establish the fact that"
"the said compensation was calculated on the market value, this Court is not"
"in  a  position  to  accept  the  contention  of  the  Respondents  that  the  said"
"compensation awarded by them is in terms of the provisions of the said Act."
"At this juncture, the attention of this Court is drawn to the observation made"
"by the Supreme Court in Choolanie Vs. Peoples Bank2, where it was held"
"that;"
"“Satisfactory  reasons  should  be  given  for  administrative  decisions.  A"
"decision not supported by adequate reasons is liable to be quashed by"
"Court."
