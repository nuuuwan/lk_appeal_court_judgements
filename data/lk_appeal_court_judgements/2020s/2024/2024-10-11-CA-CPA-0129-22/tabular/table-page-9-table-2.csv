"And in the case of Punchi nona v. Padumasena and others 2 Ismail J"
"articulated as follows;"
"“The primary object of the jurisdiction so conferred is the"
"prevention of a breach of the peace arising in respect of a"
"dispute  affecting 
land.  The  Court 
in  exercising 
this"
"jurisdiction is not involved in an investigation into title or"
"the  right  to  possession  which  is  the  function  of  a  civil"
"Court.  He  is  required  to  take  action  of  a  preventive  and"
"provisional  nature  pending final  adjudication  of  rights  in"
"a civil Court. It was therefore incumbent upon the Primary"
"Court  Judge 
to  have 
initially  satisfied  himself  as 
to"
"whether  there  was  a  threat  or  likelihood  of  a  breach  of"
"peace  and  whether he  was  justified in assuming such  a"
"special  jurisdiction  under  the  circumstances.  The  failure"
"of  the  judge  to  satisfy  himself  initially  in  regard  to  the"
"threat or likelihood of the breach of peace deprived him of"
"the 
jurisdiction 
to  proceed  with 
the 
inquiry  and 
this"
"vitiates  the  subsequent  proceedings.  For  these  reasons,"
"acting  in  revision,  1  set  aside  the  Order  of  the  Primary"
"Court Judge dated 30.1.90.”"
