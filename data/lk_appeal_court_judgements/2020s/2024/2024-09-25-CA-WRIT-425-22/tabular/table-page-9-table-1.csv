"T
he next question before this Court is, even in the absence of nomination, could the 6th"
"Respondent who claimed to be the eldest child of the Petitioner’s father, be the successor"
"to the Grant in question? We note that Section 51 of the Ordinance imposes restrictions"
"on the nomination of the successor to the holding."
"S
ection 72 of the Ordinance provides that when there is no successor has been nominated"
"or  the  successor  nominated  has  failed  to  succeed,  the  title  to  the  land  devolves  as"
"prescribed in Rule 1 of the Third Schedule. The said Rule provides for the relatives from"
"whom the successor may be nominated. In the particular Schedule, preference is given to"
"the oldest child as the successor to the impugned premises."
"H
owever,  through  the  amendment  made  by  Act  No.11  of  2022  to  the  Ordinance,  Rule"
"1(d)(i)of  the Third Schedule provides thus:"
"“where any person in the order of priority in which they are respectively mentioned"
"in the subjoined table developed such land, the title to the holding or the land shall"
"not devolve on the older person referred in paragraph (b) but on the person who"
"developed such land; or”"
"In the instant case, when the Respondents made the decision as to who is the successor"
"to the Grant, this aspect was not considered."
"I
n view of the reasoning provided above, we hold that the Petitioner has established the"
"grounds to issue writs as prayed for in the petition. Therefore, this Court issues writs of"
"Certiorari and Mandamus as prayed in prayers (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f)."
"Application allowed with costs."
