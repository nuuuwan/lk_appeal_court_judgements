"As  per  the  Petitioner’s  Letter  of  Appointment  marked  ‘P2’  the  appointing"
"authority  for  the  Petitioner  is  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Sri  Lanka  Tea"
"Board thus, the disciplinary authority is also the same."
"The Petitioner in order to substantiate the requirement of having exhausted"
"alternative  remedies  available  to  him,  tendered  two  letters  marked 
‘X1’"
"dated 16.02.2021 and ‘X2’ dated 02.03.2021(the reply by the Sri Lanka Tea"
"Board) which the Petitioner claimed to be his Appeal and subsequent reply"
"by the disciplinary authority against disciplinary order marked ‘P17’ dated"
"06.08.2021. Upon examination, it is apparent to this Court that, the said ‘X1’"
"and  ‘X2’  wherein  the  Petitioner  alleges  to  have  appealed  the  disciplinary"
"order  against  him,  are  both  issued  antecedent  to  the  date  on  which  the"
"disciplinary order was given."
"According to the language in provisions of the Establishment Code Volume"
"II, it is manifestly clear that any person aggrieved by a disciplinary order may"
"file an Appeal only after the delivery of such order, and thus it is not possible"
"to file an Appeal before a disciplinary order is issued. Accordingly, this Court"
"finds  that  the  Petitioner  in  this  case  has  not  exhausted  the  alternative"
"remedies available to him, to the disciplinary authority prior to invoking the"
"Writ jurisdiction of this Court."
"Furthermore, the Petitioner having made representations before this Court"
"stating  that  he  has  exhausted  alternative  remedies  before  invoking  the"
"jurisdiction  of  this  court,  there 
is  sufficient  material  to  state  that  the"
"Petitioner has intentionally mislead Court thus has not disclosed all material"
"facts and has violated his duty of Uberrima fides by failing to make a full and"
"frank disclosure of all material facts relevant to this Application."
