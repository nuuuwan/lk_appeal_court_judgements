"Suppression of material facts"
"T
he  learned  Counsel  appearing  for  the  2nd  Respondent  submitted  that  subsequent  to  a"
"Cabinet decision the Petitioner had been ordered to grant relief to the 2nd Respondent, and"
"the  Petitioner  has  not  challenged  the  said  decision  but  has  dragged  on  giving  various"
"reasons, delaying the implementation of the  said recommendation.  The learned Counsel"
"for  the  2nd  Respondent  further  submitted  that  it  was  the  reason  for  the  dispute  to  be"
"prolonged which culminated in the referral to arbitration. This issue had been considered"
"by the arbitrator however it is the contention of the Counsel that the Petitioner has failed"
"to submit the said Cabinet decision to this Court and has willfully suppressed material facts"
"from this Court. This Court observes that the said Cabinet decision has been referred to in"
"the Arbitral award. However, the Petitioner has failed to tender the Cabinet decision to this"
"Court. The decision marked as 2R (3) by the 2nd Respondent has not been tendered to this"
"Court.  This  Court  observes  that  the  Petitioner  has  not  only  failed  to  tender  the  Cabinet"
"decision but has also failed to plead the said Cabinet decision."
