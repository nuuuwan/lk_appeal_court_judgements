"The wording of the said Section is clear and this Court cannot accept the said submission."
"Further, we are of the view that there is no ambiguity in the said Section."
"T
his Court in Lanka Electricity Company (Pvt) Limited v. The Commissioner of Labour"
"and others CA Writ 753/23 decided on 30.09.2024 has held that for the Court of Appeal"
"to entertain an Application for the exercise of their Writ jurisdiction pursuant to Section 31"
"DDDDD  that  it  is  mandatory  that  the  Petitioner  deposits  the  security  and  it  should  be"
"supported  by  the  certificate  of  deposit  under  the  hand  of  the  Commissioner  General  of"
"Labour.  In  coming  to  the  said  conclusion,  the  Court  has  considered  the  judgments  of"
"Wimalasiri Perera and others v. Lakmali Enterprises Diesel and Petrol Motor Engineers"
"and others [2003] 1 SLR 62 and Linea Aqua (Pvt) Ltd v. P. Chinthaka Lakdewa De Silva"
"SC Appeal No. 178/2018 decided on 05.07.2019. In this case, we find the Petitioner in"
"their Petition has nowhere pleaded that they have deposited the said sum in compliance"
"with Section 31DDDDD."
"F
urthermore,  this  Court  observes  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  annex  the  certificate"
"issued by the Commissioner General with the Application. In reply to this objection, the"
"learned Counsel for the Petitioner further submitted that they have subsequent to filing the"
"Writ Application have deposited the said sum and have tendered the certificate to the Court"
"by  way  of  a  motion.  As  correctly  argued  by  the  learned  Counsel  appearing  for  the"
"Respondent the said motion has been field without the permission of the Court and had not"
"been  supported.  Even  if  this  Court  is  to  consider  this  certificate  it  will  not  absolve  the"
"Petitioner  form  not  complying  with  Section  31  DDDDD.  The  Petitioner  as  per  the"
"documents submitted by way of a motion have complied with the requirement of furnishing"
"the deposit equivalent to the amount of the award only on 27.03.2024 and the certificate is"
"dated  with  a  date  subsequent  to  that.  However,  the  Writ  Application  has  been  filed  on"
"30.01.2024. Accordingly, we find that the security deposit and the certificate have been"
"filed  several  months  after  the  filing  of  the  Petition.  Which  in  our  view,  is  a  substantial"
"noncompliance with the mandatory Section 31 DDDDD of the IDA. The said failure of the"
"Petitioner to comply with the mandatory Section of the IDA is fatal to the Writ Application."
"Accordingly,  we  hold  that  the  Respondentsâ€™  objection  has  to  succeed.  We  come  to  this"
"conclusion after careful consideration of the relevant Section of the Amendment to the Act"
"namely,  No.  22  of  2022.  As  stated  above,  even  the  Sinhala  version  of  the  Amendment"
"clearly states that the said deposit and the certificate that follows has to be submitted for"
"the Court of Appeal to entertain. Hence, we determine, for the Court of Appeal to exercise"
"the  Writ  jurisdiction  in  this  Writ  Application  the  compliance  of  Section  31  DDDDD  is"
"mandatory."
