"According to evidence as said before it had been done when the appellants were"
"trying  to  flee  together  after  committing  the  robbery  hence  the  only  conclusion"
"the  Court  can  draw  is  that  it  had  been  done  during  the  furtherance  of  the"
"common object."
"The appellants had pleaded ignorance of the incident but this had not been put"
"to the witnesses in cross-examination as such they cannot be exonerated from"
"the common object of the unlawful assembly."
"The next position to be considered is the position of the 1st appellant who had"
"come to the jewelry shop with a knife and had taken gold and furthermore on"
"the  very  same  day  he  had  been  arrested  at  Borella  with  pawning  receipts  of"
"gold  items  which  had  been  later  recovered  from  the  shop  and  marked  and"
"identified in Court."
"In the premises of the 1st appellants wife on the very same day gold items had"
"been recovered and they too had been identified during the trial"
"Hence,  considering  the  close  proximity  of  time  to  the  alleged  incident  and  the"
"dock  identification  of  the  1st  appellant  at  the  scene,  there  is  ground  for  this"
"Court to conclude that he acted in furtherance of the common object of the 3rd"
"and the 4th appellants."
"As such,the conclusion of the trial judge that the 1st along with the 3rd and the"
"4th were members of an unlawful assembly and committed the offences set out"
"in the indictment."
"Hence,  we  see  no  merit  raised  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellants  as"
"such  the  instant  appeal  is  dismissed  and  the  sentence  and  the  conviction"
"entered by the trial judge is hereby affirmed."
