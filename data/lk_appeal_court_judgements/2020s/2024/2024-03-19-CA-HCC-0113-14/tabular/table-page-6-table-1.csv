identification  must  be"

n the instant matter we observe that both the ID parades have been"

"","suspects have been in remand custody since 13th of February which"
"","is only a day away from the incident and prior to that they had been"
"","in police custody."
"","Hence  it  would  have  been  ideal  if  the  parades  were  held  with  in"

"","As  such  we  find  the  evidence  of  the  ID  parades  is  subjected  to"

is  not  substantive  evidence  but 
is  of  only  corroborative"
"","evidence."
