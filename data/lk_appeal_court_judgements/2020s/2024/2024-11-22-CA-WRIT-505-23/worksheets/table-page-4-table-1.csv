"agreed to refix the case for argument on 23.05.2024 and again on such date, the case was"
"refixed for 25.07.2024."
"In  the  meantime,  the  3rd  Respondent  by  a  Motion  dated  11.07.2024  filed  an  amended"
"Statement of Objections and moved to support this matter on 25.07.2024. When the matter"
"came up on such date, Counsel for the Petitioner objected to the said amended objection."
"This order pertains to whether to allow the said amended Statement of Objections."
"I
t should  be  noted that  both  parties  agreed that,  the matter  could  be  concluded  by  way  of"
"written submissions."
"W
hen we  peruse  the  written  submission  of  the  3rd  Respondent,  he  has  indicated  that  this"
"amendment  can  be  allowed  under  Rule  3(8)  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  (Appellate  Procedure)"
"Rules 1990 (as amended). Further, he has stated that the Petitioner has suppressed certain"
"material facts in his petition."
"A
ccording to the said written submission, the purpose of amending the objections was that,"
"the  Petitioners  have  willfully  suppressed  the  cases  between  the  Petitioners  and  the  3rd"
"Respondent namely DC/Mount Lavinia/2808/13/L and DC/Mount Lavinia/2249/06/L  which"
"amounts to willful suppression."
"A
ccording  to  the  Statement  of  Objections  of  the  3rd  Respondent  dated  20.11.2023,  the  3rd"
"Respondent has mainly objected the application on the basis that, the Petitionersâ€™ rights were"
"not affected by these constructions. But the 3rd Respondent has mentioned in paragraph 2 of"
"the  said Objections  that  the  Petitioners  have instituted  this  action  in  view  of  the decision"
"given by the District Court of Mount Lavinia."
"I
t is clear that, the 3rd Respondent had an opportunity to indicate both the cases to this Court"
"which were already been concluded as indicated in the particular Objection."
