"We note that Rule 3(8) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 stipulates:"
"“A party may, with the prior permission of the court, amend their pleadings, or file additional"
"p
l
eadings, affidavits, or other documents, within two weeks of the granting of such"
"permission, unless the Court directs otherwise. After notice has been issued, such permission"
"shall not be granted ex-parte.” (emphasis added)"
"I
n the present case, the amended objections were filed by the 3rd Respondent on 11.07.2024"
"by  way  of  a  Motion  without  obtaining  the  Court's  prior  authorization.  Thereafter,  the  3rd"
"Respondent sought permission to support this matter before this Court."
"W
e are mindful that, the Learned Magistrate has made an order to demolish in 2008. Up to"
"now, the said order has not been carried out by the 1st Respondent. For the last 16 years,"
"these  constructions  have  been  a  nuisance  to  the  Petitioners.  The  3rd  Respondent  is  taking"
"advantage from abusing the procedure by filing this amendment."
"I
n any way, the failure to indicate the cases could be taken up at the argument stage. Further,"
"the Court was aware that there were cases instituted in the District Court of Mount Lavinia"
"regarding the subject matter."
"F
or the above-said reasons, we disallow the application to amend the objections."
"This case is refixed for arguments."
