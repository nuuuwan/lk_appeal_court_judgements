"Rajender Mohan Rana & Ors Vs Prem Prakash Chaudhary & Ors1, it was held that,"
"“Naturally, the word ‘may’ mean discretion and is not mandatory. In the present"
"case, we do not see any reason why the word ‘may’ in Section 55 should be read"
"as ‘must’ or ‘shall.’ Courts do not interpret the word ‘may’ as ‘shall’ unless"
"such interpretation is necessary and required to void absurdity, inconvenient"
"consequence or is mandated by the legislature’s intent, which is collected from"
"other parts of the statute.” [emphasis added]"
