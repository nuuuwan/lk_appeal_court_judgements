"""The question that arises for consideration in this application is what should a"
"Court exercising Writ jurisdiction do, when confronted with an argument that"
"an alternative remedy is available to the Petitioner and that such alternative"
"remedy should be resorted to? This Court is of the view that a rigid principle"
"cannot be laid down and that the appropriate decision would depend on the"
"facts and circumstances of each case. That said, where the statute provides a"
"specific alternative remedy, a person dissatisfied with a decision of a statutory"
"body should pursue that statutory remedy instead of invoking a discretionary"
"remedy of this Court. That remedy should be equally effective and should be"
"able to prevent an injustice that a Petitioner is seeking to avert. Furthermore,"
"if the Writ jurisdiction is invoked where an equally effective remedy is available,"
"an explanation should be offered as to why that equally effective remedy has"
"not been resorted to.‚Äù [Emphasis Added]"
