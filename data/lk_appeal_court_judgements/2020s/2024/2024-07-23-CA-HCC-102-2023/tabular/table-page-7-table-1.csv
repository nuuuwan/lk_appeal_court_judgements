"the case before them when imposing sentence, since those factors will play"
"a key role in deciding the sentence.”"
"Basnayake, ACJ. (as he was then) in the case of Attorney General Vs. H. N."
"De Silva (1955) 57 NLR 121, after having considered the things that should be"
"considered by a Judge when sentencing an accused person observed:"
"“A  Judge  should,  in  determining  the  proper  sentence,  first  consider  the"
"gravity  of  the  offence  as  it  appears  from  the  nature  of  the  act  itself  and"
"should have regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or other"
"statutes  under  which  the  offender  is  charged.  He  should  also  regard  the"
"effect of the punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it will"
"be  effective.  If  the  offender  held  a  position  of  trust  or  belong  to  a  service"
"which enjoys the confidence that must be taken into account in assessing"
"the punishment. The incidents of crime of the nature of which the offender"
"has been found to be guilty and the difficulty of detection are also matters"
"which  should  receive  due  consideration.  The  reformation  of  the  criminal"
"though no doubt an important consideration, is subordinate to the others I"
"have mentioned. Where the public interest or the welfare of the State (which"
"are synonymous) outweighs the previous good character, antecedents and"
"age of the offender pubic interest must prevail.”"
"Although our Courts do not have the advantage of following statutory sentencing"
"guidelines  in  sentencing  an  accused  person,  it  is  clear  that  the  above  views"
"expressed by Basnayake, ACJ. has been followed by our Courts with necessary"
"adaptations  from  time  to  time,  since  deciding  what  would  be  the  appropriate"
"sentence of an accused person found guilty after trial or at situations where the"
"accused  opted  to  plead  guilty  to  the  charges  depends  on  the  facts  and  the"
"circumstances of the relevant case."
"It is clear from the sentencing order that the learned High Court Judge was well"
"possessed of the matters that should be considered in sentencing the appellant,"
"when the appellant was sentenced for rigorous imprisonment period of 6 years"
