"In his submissions, in supporting the Application on 27.8.2024, the Petitioner submitted"
"that they have deposited the said sum and have tendered to Court the certificate of the"
"Commissioner General which is long after the objection was taken. In fact, as per the"
"submissions of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner, the deposit was made"
"only on 02.04.2024. The certificate of the Commissioner General appears to be dated"
"09.04.2024 which has been filed by a motion dated 29.05.2024. Hence it is clear that"
"the Petitioner has failed to comply with  Section 31DDDDD at the time of filing this"
"Application.  The  Petitioner  has  complied  with  the  provision  only  after  a  substantial"
"delay of nearly five months and subsequent to the objection raised by the Respondents."
