"In  Dissanayake  v.  Fernando  (1986)  71  NLR  356  His  Lordship  Weeramantry  J.,"

"A
fter considering the submissions of all parties, I am of the view that the Petitioner has"
"failed  to  establish  a  prima  facie  case  and  also  this  Court  is  inclined  to  uphold  the"
"preliminary objections of the Respondent. Accordingly, for  the reasons stated above,"
"this Court is not inclined to issue formal notice and proceeds to dismiss this Application."
