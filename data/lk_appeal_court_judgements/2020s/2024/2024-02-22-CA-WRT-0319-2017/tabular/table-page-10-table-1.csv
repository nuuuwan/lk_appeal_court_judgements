"In 
the 
case 
of  Weligama  Multi-Purpose  Co-Operative  Society 
Ltd  Vs."
"Chandradasa  Daluwatta  [1984]  1  Sri  LR  195,  Sharvananda  J.,  as  he  then"
"was, delivering the judgment of 5 judges of the Supreme Court presided by"
"Samarakoon CJ, held as follows:"
"“
Mandamus lies to secure the performance of a public duty in the performance"
"of  which  an  applicant  has  sufficient 
legal 
interest 
to  be  enforceable  by"
"Mandamus  the  duty  to  be  performed  must  be  of  a  public  nature  and  not"
"merely  of  private  character.    The  public  duty  may  be  imposed 
‘by  either"
"statute, charter, or the common law or custom’.”"
"In  Ratnayake  and  Others  vs  C.D.Perera  and  others  [1982]  2  Sri  LR  451  the"
"Supreme Court held as follows;"
"The  general  rule  of  Mandamus 
is  that 
its  function 
is  to  compel  a  public"
"authority  to  do  its  duty.  The  essence  of  Mandamus  is  that  it  is  a  command"
"issued by  the Superior  Court for the performance of public legal duty. Where"
"officials  have  a  public  duty 
to  perform  and  have 
refused 
to  perform,"
"Mandamus  will 
lie 
to  secure 
the  performance  of 
the  public  duty, 
in 
the"
"performance  of  which  the  applicant  has  sufficient  legal  interest.  It  is  only"
"granted to compel the performance of duties of a public nature, and not merely"
"of private character, that is to say, for the enforcement of a mere private right,"
"stemming from a contract of the parties."
"""The duty to be performed must be of a public nature. A Mandamus will not lie"
"to order admission or restoration to an office essentially of a private character,"
"nor in general, will it lie to secure the due performance of the obligations owed"
"by a company towards its  members, or to resolve any, other private dispute,"
"such  as  a  claim  to  reinstatement  to  membership  of  a  trade  union,  nor  will  it"
"issue to a private arbitral tribunal"" de Smith Judicial Review 4th Ed. page 540."
"It is settled law that for Mandamus to lie the applicant must have a legal right"
"to  the  performance  of some  duty,  of  a  public  and  not  of  a  private  character -"
"Perera  Vs.  Municipal  Council,  Colombo.  Even  a  duty  arising  under  a  statute"
"may be a duty of a private kind."

n  the  case  of  Piyasiri  v  People’s  Bank  and  Others  [1989]  2  Sri  LR  47,"

"for an interview to promotion in terms of the circular as:"
