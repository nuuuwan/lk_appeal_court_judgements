"II.","Ex  facie,  the  grounds  urged  in  paragraph  35  of  the  petition  for"
"","invoking 
the 
jurisdiction  of 
court  under  Article  140  of 
the"
"","Constitution are misconceived and unattainable in law and do not"
"","constitute  grounds  to  invoke  jurisdiction  of  court.    The  petition"
"","should, therefore, be dismissed in limine."
"III.","The  circulars  allegedly  challenged  and  adverted  to  in  the  petition"
"","by 
the  petitioner  are  not 
instruments  having  statutory 
force,"
"","statutorily  sanctioned  or  gazetted 
regulations. 
  They  are  not"
"","referable  to  the  exercise  of  any  delegated  legislative  power.    The"
"","petitioner’s application for Writ of Mandamus is, therefore, ex-facie"
"","totally misconceived in law."
"IV.","The  Petitioner  has  ex  facie  failed  to  comply  with  Rule  3  (1)  (a)  of"
"","the  Court  of  Appeal  (appellate  procedure)  Rules  1990  relating  to"
"","application  for  the  exercise  of  powers  vested  in  Article  140  of  the"
"","Constitution  and 
the  petition  must 
therefore  be  dismissed 
in"
"","limine."
"V.","The  petitioner  has  ex-facie  the  petition  violated  the  mandatory"
"","provisions of section 123 of the Evidence Ordinance as confirmed"
"","by 
the  averments 
in  paragraph  125  of 
the  petition  and 
the"
"","corresponding paragraphs of his affidavit.  The said averments are"
"","consequently not receivable in law.  The petition should, therefore,"
"","be dismissed."
"VI.","The petitioner has violated the provisions of sections 45,  and 122"
"","of the Monetary Law Act."
"VII.","The  petitioner  has  wilfully  and  directly  violated  the  obligation  of"
"","fidelity/secrecy 
sworn 
by 
the 
petitioner 
at 
the 
time 
of"
"","commencement  of  his  employment  at  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri"
"","Lanka,  in  terms  of  the  Classification  Control  and  Appeal  Rules  of"
"","the Central Bank of Sri Lanka which made in terms of petition 10"
"","of the Monetary Law Act."
"VIII.","In  this  background,  the  respondents  state  that  it  is  settled  law"
"","that 
a 
person  who 
approaches 
the  Court 
for 
a 
grant 
of"
"","discretionary relief has to come with clean hands.  The petitioner’s"
"","conduct  as 
illustrated  by 
the  petitioner’s  pleadings 
that 
the"
"","petitioner  is  guilty  of  gross  illegal  conduct  and  guilty  of  violating"
"","his duty of uberrima fides.  On this ground as well the petitioner’s"
"","application should be dismissed in limine."
