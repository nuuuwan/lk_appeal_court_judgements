"Appellant  and/or  issuing  Notice  of  Assessment  on  the  Appellant  was  not  the"
"Assessor who purported to provide 'reasons' therefor?"
"The Appellant has drawn the attention of the Court that the letter of intimation dated"
"31.10.20147  which  sets  out  the  reasons  for  the  assessment  has  been  issued  by  the"
"Assessor  S.  H.  P.  Champa  Sharmali  Perera  but  the  Notice  of  Assessment  dated"
"26.11.20148 bears the seal of Nuran Perera,  who is an Assistant Commissioner. The"
"learned Counsel appearing for the Appellant argued that in terms of Section 163(3) read"
"with  Section  164  of  the  Act,  the  same  person  who  issues  the  Notice  of  Assessment"
"should  make  the  assessment  and  communicate  the  reasons  for  not  accepting  the  tax"
"return.  The  learned  DSG  appearing  for  the  Respondent  argued  that  the  letter  of"
"intimation includes the assessment and under Section 163(3) the Assessorâ€™s task is to"
"assess  the  person  and  communicate  the  reasons  for  not  accepting  the  tax  return."
"Therefore, Assessor S. H. P. Champa Sharmali Perera has acted according to the law"
"by signing the assessment sheet dated 10.11.20149 and issuing the letter of intimation"
"dated  31.10.201410.  The  learned  DSG  further  argues  that  the  Notice  of  Assessment"
"issued  under  Section  164  is  a  computer-generated  document  and  a  ministerial  task."
"Therefore, the Notice of Assessment and the letter of intimation need not be sent by the"
"same person."
