"“It may be noted, that this amendment in 2015 is referred to not because it applies"
"to  the  years  of  assessment  in  question  in  this  case,  but  because  it  shows  the"
"intention  of  the  legislature  to  apply  section  63  even  if  the  dividend  income  is"
"classified under section 3(1)(a)."
"Hence it appears that the amendments in 2014 and 2015 have a further purifying"
"effect on the principle embodied in section 63 of the Act.”"
