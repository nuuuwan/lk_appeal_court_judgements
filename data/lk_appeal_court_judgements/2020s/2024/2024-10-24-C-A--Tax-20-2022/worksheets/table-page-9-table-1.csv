"Question of Law III"
"Did the Assessor, the Commissioner-General, and the Tax Appeals Commission,"
"err  in  law  in  failing  to  recognize  that  the  Appellant  functioned  as  a  Holding"
"Company as opposed to an Investment Company?"
"The  position  of  the  Commissioner  General  and  the  TAC  is  that  the  Appellant  is  an"
"investment  company  and  therefore,  the  dividend  and  interest  received  by  it  forms"
"“business income” in terms of Section 3(a) of the Act. In deciding that the Appellant is"
"an Investment Company as opposed to a Holding Company, the Respondent relied on"
"the fact that the number of companies in which the Appellant has invested changes from"
"year to year and out of the companies it held shares, it had more than 50% shares only"
"in two companies."
"The Appellant relied on the interpretation provided in Section 529 of the Companies"
"Act, No. 7 of 2007 and argued that the Appellant is a holding company."
