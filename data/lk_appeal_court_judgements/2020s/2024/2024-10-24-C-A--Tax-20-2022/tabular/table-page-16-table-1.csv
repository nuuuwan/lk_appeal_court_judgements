"dividends."
"The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the legislature intends to prevent"
"the same subject from being taxed at multiple stages of the same tax chain. When a"
"company  generates  profits,  the  tax  is  charged  by  way  of  corporate  tax,  and  when"
"distributing the dividends, the subsidiary company pays withholding tax. The argument"
"of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  is  that charging  tax  from  the  Appellant  on"
"dividends  in  this  set-up  where  the  subsidiary  companies  have  already  paid  the  tax"
"amount to double taxation."
"The position of the learned DSG for the Respondent is that, as argued in Questions of"
"Law numbers  III,  IV and VI the dividend and interest  income should be  recognised"
"under  Section  3(a),  however,  the  exemption  for  dividend  income  was  introduced  to"
"Section  63  only  after  the  Amendment  Act,  No.  9  of  2015.  The  learned  Counsel"
"appearing  for  the  Appellant  argued  that  the  explicit  exclusion  of  Section  3(a)  under"
"Section  63  is  a  mere  clarification  provided,  all  forms  of  dividend  income  has  been"
"exempted from tax under the Act. Therefore, regardless of which subsection the income"
"has  been  recognized,  it  should  be  excluded.  This  Court  observes  that  the  literal"
"interpretation  of the legislature  has not  excluded the dividend income under Section"
"3(a).  In  the  case  of  John  Keells  Holdings  PLC  vs.  Commissioner  General  of  Inland"
