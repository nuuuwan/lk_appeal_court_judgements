"companies  through  shareholding  and  the  Appellant  has  held  more  than  50%  of  the"
"shares of the companies directly or indirectly as a group of companies.15 Therefore, it"
"is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  the  Appellant  company  is  functioning  as  a  Holding"
"Company rather than an Investment Company."
"Based on the above circumstances, I am of the view that the Commissioner General of"
"Inland Revenue and the TAC have erred in law in failing to recognize that the Appellant"
"company functions as a Holding Company as opposed to an Investment Company. I"
"answer the third question of law in the affirmative and in favour of the Appellant."
"Question of Law IV"

"2006, and not within Section 3(a) of the said Act?"
"Question of Law V"
"Were  the  dividends  earned  by  the  Appellant  in  the  first  instance,  liable  to  be"
"considered as “income” within Section 3(e) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of"
"2006, and not within Section 3(a) of the said Act?"
"The Court will address the fourth and fifth questions of law together as follows."
