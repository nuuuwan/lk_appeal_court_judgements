"minimal  force  and  traditional  methods  to  avoid  unnecessary  pain  or  oppression.  Certain"
"requirements are provided in those Regulations for the transportation of elephants, including"
"vehicle specifications, duration limits, and speed limits to ensure safe and humane transport."
"Similarly, in terms of Regulation 2(r) and 2(s), elephants must be allowed sufficient time to"
"sleep, especially young elephants under five years old and only traditional tools with specific"
"standards  are  allowed 
for 
training  and  control,  prohibiting  other  sharp  weapons  and"
"anesthetics to prevent harm."
"The question that arises here is whether those Regulations override the provisions of FFPO."
"I  have  already  dealt  with  the  impugned  Regulations  in  Part  II  comparing  them  with  the"
"provisions of the enabling statute. I am unable to find any implicit violation of the provisions"
"of the FFPO by promulgating Regulation 2(a) to 2(z) in Part I of the impugned Regulations."
"The Respondent's primary contention against the said Regulations 2(a) to 2(z) is that those"
"provisions encourage using elephants for commercial purposes etc. I do not intend to reject"
"bluntly such contentions of the Respondents as I need further deliberations and more evidence"
"upon such elements."
"I  am  unable  to  ignore  the  fact  that  several  tamed  elephants  are  in  the  custody  of  private"
"individuals and State authorities. I am aware that those tamed elephants are currently being"
"used for religious processions and the promotion of tourism by private owners etc.  Anyhow,"
"my fervent view is that any kind of safety and welfare of those tamed elephants upon whom"
"due  licenses  have  been  issued  should  not  be  hindered  until  a  public  policy  is  taken  by  the"
"authorities to allow those tamed elephants to continue to be under private owners/State or"
"release all of them to the wild. This Court has no expertise in examining the psychology and"
"physiology of a tamed elephant who is in the custody of a private owner/State. Further, a"
"reasonable doubt arises as to whether favorable steps would be taken by the authorities or the"
"politicians  in  respect  of  the  existing  set  of  tamed  elephants  who  are  duly  registered  and"
"licensed in the Country in the event this Court was to quash the Regulations reflected in Part"
"I  of  the 
impugned  Regulations.  Hence,  I  am  not 
inclined  to  disturb  the  existence  of"
"Regulations 2(a) to 2(z) in Part I of the impugned Regulations at this stage."
