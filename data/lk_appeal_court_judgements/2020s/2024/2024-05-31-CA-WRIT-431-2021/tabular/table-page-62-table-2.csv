"United Africa Company Limited [(1961) 3 All E.R. 1169 at 1172] have been adopted. In the said"
"Macfoy case, Lord Denning has stated:"
"“If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only bad, but incurably bad. There"
"is no need for an order of the court to set it aside. It is automatically null and void without"
"more ado, though it is sometimes convenient to have the court declare it to be so. And"
"every proceeding which is founded on it is also bad and incurably bad. You cannot put"
"something on nothing and expect it to stay there. It will collapse.”"
