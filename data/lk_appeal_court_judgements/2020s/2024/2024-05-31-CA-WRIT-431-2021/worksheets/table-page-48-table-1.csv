"find any procedure adopted in the FFPO where registration can be sanctioned for a person"
"who purportedly becomes an owner through a so-called sannasa."
"In the circumstances, the question that arises is whether Regulation 5(2) can be promulgated"
"allowing the registration of an elephant that is in the custody of an owner but has not been"
"registered as of the date of commencement of those Regulations, whereas section 22A (1) of"
"the FFPO explicitly prohibits ownership, custody or use of an elephant unless it is registered"
"and  a  license  has  been  obtained  in  respect  of  the  elephant  concerned  by  the  said  section"
"22A(1)."
"Regulation 6(2) does not reflect any requirement to inquire from a person who seeks belated"
"registration of an elephant under the said Regulation as to why the purported acquisition of"
"such  elephant  has  not  been  reported  immediately  under  section  22A  (6)  to  the  Director"
"General of Wildlife Conservation or the prescribed Officer. Further, it is observed that the"
"said  Regulation  6(2)  does  not  prescribe  a  particular  form  for  the  registration  of  elephants"
"acquired through a sannasa etc. It is observed that the Impugned Regulations 5(2) and 6(2)"
"enable  a  person  who  owned,  had  custody  or  made  use  of  an  unregistered  elephant  to"
"regularize their ownership through retroactive registration."
"It is noted that in terms of section 22A, only an owner or custodian can seek registration of"
"elephants and the category of persons stipulated in impugned Regulation 5(1) do not fall into"
"the category of a person who owns or has in his custody an elephant. It is a vital factor to"
"disclose how the elephant came into the custody of the person who seeks registration."
"I am convinced with the contention of the Petitioners that no person can possess an elephant"
"without a license and registration provided the registration of elephants was duly carried out"
"as provided for under the FFPO and the register of elephants was duly maintained."
"Further, the Petitioners claim that the  impugned Regulations are intended to benefit those"
"who are subject to the law and who remain liable for prosecution and punishment under the"
"FFPO  and  the  Offenses  Against  Public  Property  Act.  However,  section  13  of  the  FFPO"
"provides  for  certain  steps  to  be  taken  by  the  Director  General  of  Wildlife  Conservation"
"whenever it appears to him that in any area outside a National Reserve damage to any person"
"or  any  house,  crop,  plantation  or  other  property  is  likely  to  be  caused  by  any  elephant."
