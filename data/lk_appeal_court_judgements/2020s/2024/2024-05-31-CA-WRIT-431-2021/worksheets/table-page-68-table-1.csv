"…………………….The issue of free licences for the destruction of rogue elephants should be"
"stopped and the control and destruction of dangerous elephants should be the function solely of"
"the Department of Wild Life. There is considerable abuse and cruelty under the present practice"
"of  issuing  licences  to  individuals  for  the  capture  of  elephants  as  well  as  for  the  destruction  of"
"dangerous ones. We further stress that the capture of baby elephants by private parties without"
"authority  should  be  completely  prohibited.  In  cases  of  baby  elephants  found  abandoned,  the"
"Department of Wild Life should make arrangements for taking them on.”"
