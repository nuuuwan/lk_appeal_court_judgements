"the Code of Criminal Procedure Act  (No. 15 of 1979). He submitted that once an order is"
"made under section 25 of the FFPO no further steps can be taken in respect of the elephant."
"Further,  he  submitted  that  the  impugned  order  of  the  learned  Magistrate  had  been  issued"
"under section 431 of the said Code of Criminal Procedure Act; but the learned Magistrate has"
"no jurisdiction to make the said impugned order which is ex facie wrong."
"At  this  stage,  I  must  closely  examine  the  decisions  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  referred  to"
"above and the background to it as reflected in the documents tendered to the Court. It appears"
"that  such  Cabinet  Memorandums  and  Decisions  allegedly  suggest  a  concerted  effort  to"
"address legal and regulatory challenges surrounding the ownership and management of tamed"
"elephants subjected to those cases. However, it is pertinent to note that such an alleged effort"
"appears  to  have  multiple  layers,  including  regulatory  changes  aimed  at  resolving  pending"
"court  cases.  In  the  process  of  settlement  of  Pending  Cases,  the  Cabinet  has  directed  the"
"Ministry of Wildlife to seek the Attorney General's advice/assistance to resolve the criminal"
"cases involving tamed elephants or to withdraw such cases. A significant component of the"
"Cabinet's  strategy  paved  the  way  for  the  registration  of  tamed  elephants,  including  those"
"without  licenses.  A  reasonable  question  arises  as  to  whether  the  emphasis  on  reaching"
"amicable settlements in pending court cases and the directive to withdraw such criminal cases"
"reflect a motive to encourage the authorities to override the legal provisions of FFPO."
"I  take  the  view  that  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers'  decisions  regarding  the  regularization  of  the"
"registration of tamed elephants reveal a significant disregard for legal principles and statutory"
"mandates. The concerted effort to settle pending criminal proceedings or to withdraw such"
"cases  without  a  solid  legal  foundation,  as  evidenced  by  the  documents  presented,  raises"
"significant concerns about the rule of law and adherence to established legal principals. The"
"Cabinet's directive to the Ministry of Wildlife to seek the Attorney General's advice for settling"
"cases  related  to  tamed  elephants,  rather  than  allowing  these  cases  to  proceed  through  the"
"judicial  system,  undermines  the  integrity  of  the  legal  process.  This  approach  suggests  a"
"preference  for  expediency  over  justice,  potentially  compromising  the  fair  adjudication  of"
"criminal cases."
