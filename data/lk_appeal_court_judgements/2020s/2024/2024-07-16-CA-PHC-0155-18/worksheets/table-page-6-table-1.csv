"In  this  case  the  prosecution  had  called  15  witnesses  and  marked"
"documents  P1-P15 
in  support  of  their  case.  When  the  prosecution"
"closed  their  case,  the  Learned  Magistrate  of  Kurunegala  had  called  for"
"the  defence.  The  Accused  giving  evidence  from  witness  box,  closed  his"
"case.  On  29.08.2014,  the  Learned  Magistrate  delivered  her  judgment"
"and acquitted the Accused from all the charges."
"The one and only exceptional circumstances urged before this Court is"
"that  the  Learned  Magistrate  of  Kurunegala  had 
failed  to  take 
into"
"consideration  of  the  documents  marked  P1-PW15  during  the  trial.  As"
"these  are  vital  documents,  the  Counsel  for  the  Appellants  strenuously"
"argued 
that 
the 
Learned  Magistrate 
should 
have 
perused 
and"
"considered them before delivering her judgment."
"On  perusal  of  the  judgment  of  the  Learned  Magistrate  of  Kurunegala,"
"she  had 
very 
correctly 
analysed 
the 
evidence 
adduced 
by 
the"
"prosecution and documents marked in the trial. Further, she had very"
"correctly  considered 
the  defence  version  before  she  arrived  at  her"
"decision.  After  considering  the  evidence  presented  by  both  parties,  the"
"Learned  Magistrate  had  concluded  that  the  prosecution  had  failed  to"
"prove 
the  charges  against 
the  Accused  beyond 
reasonable  doubt."
"Therefore, the Accused was acquitted from the case."
"The Judgment of the Learned Magistrate does not show any miscarriage"
"of  justice  or  error  in  law.  The  grounds  mentioned  in  the  petition  of"
"appeal do not warrant any exceptional circumstances which shock the"
"conscience of the Court.  Hence, the judgment dated 05.09.2018 of the"
"Learned  High  Court  of  Kurunegala  dismissing  the  revision  application"
"too had not caused  any miscarriage of justice and is according to law."
"Therefore, this appeal is dismissed."
