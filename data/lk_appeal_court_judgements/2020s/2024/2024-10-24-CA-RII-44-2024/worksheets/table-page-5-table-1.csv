"execution in relation to the instant action, bearing No. 1446/L of the District Court of Nuwara"
"Eliya, on the 7th of November 2023."
"T
he Petitioner avers that, by virtue of the impugned deed bearing No. 3308, she transferred"
"only a portion of the land detailed in the second schedule of the plaint. She further asserts that"
"both she and her father had been in possession of a larger parcel of land more fully described"
"in the first schedule. The land sought by the Plaintiff, as claimed, remained an undivided part"
"of  the  original  land,  and  both  the  schedule  to  the  plaint  as  well  as  the  schedule  to  the"
"impugned  deed  No.  3008  clearly  indicate  that  the  northern  boundary  of  the  subject  land"
"adjoins the remaining portion of the same larger land."
"The  Petitioner  further  states  that  on  or  about  07.11.2023,  the  Fiscal  Officer  of  the  District"
"Court of Walapane arrived at the premises described in the first  schedule of this petition to"
"execute  the  writ  pertaining  to  the  case.  Upon  the  officer's  arrival,  the  Petitioner  raised"
"objections  to  the  execution  of  the  writ,  specifically  opposing  her  ejectment  from  the  entire"
"land described in  the first  schedule. Notwithstanding her objections, the  writ was  executed,"
"resulting in her eviction from the entirety of the larger land."
"Aggrieved by what she contends was an unlawful eviction, the Petitioner subsequently sought"
"relief from the District Court of Nuwara Eliya. However, despite her application, the learned"
"District  Judge  refused  to  issue  notice  on  the  Respondent.  The  Petitioner,  being  dissatisfied"
"with the outcome, now seeks appropriate legal recourse to address the injustice caused to her"
"by the said wrongful eviction."
"The  Petitioner  asserts  that  the  writ  was  executed  without  the  proper  identification  of  the"
"subject  matter  in  question.  She  further  contends  that  no  surveyor  was  present  during  the"
"execution  of  the  writ,  and  no  plan  or  survey  was  utilized  to  accurately  identify  the  subject"
"land.  This,  she  argues,  has  led  to  a  wrongful  and  unlawful  execution  of  the  writ  without"
"adequate verification of the boundaries or the specific area subject to the dispute."
"Upon examination of the pleadings and the schedule of the plaint, it becomes evident that the"
"Plaintiff is claiming title to a portion of land described in Deed No. 3008, dated 05.05.2008,"
"which is as follows."
