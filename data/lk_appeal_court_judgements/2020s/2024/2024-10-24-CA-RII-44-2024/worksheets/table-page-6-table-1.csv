"Land called ‘Watavelthennaya’ a part of TP Plan 168557 situated in Nidandahinna,"
"Walapane  Yati  Palatha  Korale,  Nuwara  Eliya  District,  Central  Province,  in  extent  of  forty"
"feet long and forty feet wide, or one thousand six hundred square feet (40x40 + 1600) or one"
"hundred  and  sixty  square  meters  (160  sqm)  bounded  to  the  north  by  remaining  part  of  the"
"same  land,  to  the  East  by  reserved  land  strip  along  the  highway  to  the  South  by  the  land"
"belonging to Mr. DP Yapathilaka and to the Wesby land belonging to Palawatte Apphuhami."
"While  the  Plaintiff  relies  on  Deed  No.  3008  to  support  her  claim  over  the  disputed  land,  it"
"must  be  emphasized  that  the  deed  in  question  describes  a  specific  portion  of  the  land"
"measuring forty feet in length and forty feet in  width—amounting to a total of 1600 square"
"feet. Though the Petitioner also may have bought the land as for the same schedule, she has"
"been in possession of such for 30 years or more even as for the documents submitted by the"
"Plaintiff  herself.  As  it  is  apparent  the  larger  land  which  the  Petitioner  claims  to  be  is  an"
"adjoining land which has been enjoyed by the Petitioner on inheritance/prescription or some"
"other right. However, the Plaintiff’s legal entitlement under the deed is thus confined to this"
"1600 square feet of land. This portion, as described in the deed, is valid insofar as it refers to"
"the  specific  area  covered  by  the  deed.  However,  while  the  deed  grants  ownership  to  the"
"Plaintiff over this defined plot of land, it cannot, by itself, invalidate any rights that may have"
"been  acquired  by  the  Petitioner  through  inheritance/prescriptive  possession  or  in  any  other"
"manner."
"Therefore,  it  is  nothing  but  proper  for  the  court  to  obtain  the  assistance  of  a  qualified"
"surveyor to  accurately identify  and demarcate the Plaintiff’s land  as described in  Deed No."
"3008.  The  Plaintiff’s  claim  is  limited  to  a  plot  measuring  40  feet  by  40  feet  (1600  square"
"feet),  and  the  surveyor  must  ensure  that  this  portion  tallies  with  the  deed’s  boundaries  as"
"much  as  possible.  Given  potential  discrepancies  between  textual  descriptions  and  physical"
"markers  on  the  land,  the  surveyor's  role  is  crucial  in  reconciling  these  differences.  This"
"ensures  that  the  Plaintiff's  claim  is  properly  enforced,  while  also  respecting  any  right  the"
"Petitioner may have acquired over the years. The surveyor’s findings will guide the court in"
"fairly resolving the dispute by safeguarding the legal rights of both parties."
"Upon careful examination, it is evident that the execution of the writ by the lower court was"
"not in accordance with the applicable legal principles. Specifically, the writ failed to properly"
