"In  the  Attorney-General  v.  Rawther  25  NLR  385,  Ennis,  J.  states  thus:"
"[1987} 1 SLR 155"
"""The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence."
"His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his"
"guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt”."
"In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:"
"“ the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in"
"a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is"
"well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of"
"probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond"
"the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it"
"admitted  fanciful  possibilities  to  deflect  the  course  of  justice.  If  the"
"evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility"
"in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, “of course it is"
"possible,  but  not  in  the  least  probable,”  the  case  is  proved  beyond"
"reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice”."
"As the appeal grounds raised by the Appellant are inter-related, the grounds"
"will be considered together in this case."
"Probability holds a very important role when it comes to convincing the judge"
"on a specific point as more the probability of the assumption more will be"
"chances for the judge to get convinced. Probability, it is of utmost importance"
"during criminal investigation and is used to assess the significance of various"
"types of evidence. To accuse someone “beyond reasonable doubt” it becomes"
"quintessential to have strong evidence and for the sake of that one has to"
"make few assumptions to reach certain conclusions, the possibility of these"
"assumptions to be true is specifically know as principle of probability in legal"
"terms."
