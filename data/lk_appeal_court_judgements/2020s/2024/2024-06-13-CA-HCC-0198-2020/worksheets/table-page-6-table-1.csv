"In this case, only 04 police officers had conducted the raid. They had set off"
"from the police station without any specific information. According to PW1"
"he had received the information after seven hours of leaving their unit and"
"the Appellant was arrested at 5.00pm.  The Appellant was taken to a jewellery"
"shop  named  ‘Letchumi  Jewellery’  at  5.30pm  and  weighed  the  substances"
"which  took  about  two  and  half  hours  and  the  Appellant  was  produced  to"
"Grandpass  Police  Station  at  8.00pm.  The  gross  quantity  said  to  have"
"recovered  from  the  Appellant  is  10610  milligrams.  To  weigh  this  meagre,"
"amount  the  police  officers  had  taken  two  and  half  hours,  which  is  highly"
"improbable considering the circumstances of the case."
"According  to  PW1,  when  he  set  off  for  the  crime  prevention  duty  on  the"
"11.01.2017, he had taken a Criminal Note Pad, Sealing and Weighing Kit,"
"his Pistol, and cash Rs.2000/-.When he was questioned as to why he did not"
"note down the information in the Criminal Note Pad, PW1 had stated that he"
"did not possess a pad on which he could have written the information. This"
"is a per se contradiction which certainly impacts adversely in his evidence."
"PW1 was the Officer-in-Charge of the Colombo South Crime Prevention Unit"
"that came under the direct supervision of the Deputy Inspector General of"
"Colombo  and  it  is  a  specialized  unit  to  combat  crime.  As  such  crime"
"prevention  duty  is  not  restricted  to  any  particular  crime,  but  include  all"
"crimes. With this intention PW1 had taken sealing and weighing Kit along"
"with  them.  Instead  of  using  the  same,  he  had  gone  to  a  jewellery  shop  to"
"weigh the Heroin said to have recovered from the Appellant. When PW1 was"
"confronted of this point, he had simply said that he did not take the sealing"
"kit but had taken the measuring kit to measure illicit liquor. This too raises"
"doubt in the prosecution’s case to some extent."
"Although  the  Appellant  was  arrested  at  Madampitiya  Road,  Colombo-14,"
"where he also resides, PW1 had not taken any meaningful action to search"
"his house nor common sense approach to investigate the person from whom"
"he received the Heroin packets for sale. This lethargic attitude of the raiding"
