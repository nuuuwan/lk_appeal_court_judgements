"CA (PHC) APN 157/2022"
"an employee of the said Nishan Tours at the request of the Accused by a"
"phone call."
"The Learned Magistrate has dismissed the application on the basis that"
"the Petitioner had failed to show that she took all necessary precautions"
"to prevent a crime being committed."
"In this case the owner of the vehicle, the Petitioner had given evidence in"
"court. According to her, she had given the vehicle to Nishan Torus on a"
"rent. Her husband Chaminda Pushpakumara is the person who handled"
"the transaction and supervised the vehicle on her behalf."
"Chaminda  Pushpakumara  also  gave  evidence  and  corroborated  the"
"evidence given by the Petitioner."
"The Owner of the Nishan Tours also gave evidence and corroborated the"
"evidence gave by husband of the Petitioner."
"In  this  case  the  Petitioner  had  legally  entered  into  an  agreement  with"
"Nishan Tours and rented her vehicle which is the subject matter of this"
"case.  Further  she  made  supervision  through  her  husband  about  the"
"movement of the vehicle and she also called the Nishan Tours to check"
"her vehicle. Nishan Tours had re-rented the vehicle as per the agreement"
"and the incident had happened without the knowledge of the Petitioner."
"Hence, the Learned Magistrate simply dismissing the application on the"
"basis  that  the  Petitioner  had  failed  to  show  cause  that  she  took  all"
"necessary precautions to prevent a crime being committed is not correct"
"in this case."
"Endorsing  the  finding  of  Learned  Magistrate,  the  Learned  High  Court"
"Judge  had  failed  to  consider  the  evidence  adduced  on  behalf  of  the"
"Petitioner properly."
"Hence, I set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Negombo"
"dated 21.10.2022 and the order of Learned Magistrate of Welisara dated"
"12.02.2020."
