"is  due  to  haemorrhage  and  shock  following  multiple  stab  injuries  on  the"
"chest  and  abdomen  penetrating  lungs,  liver  and  severing  the  inferno  vane"
"Cora."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  concluded  that  the  evidence  given  by"
"PW2 is convincing and acted upon the said evidence to convict the Appellant"
"for the charge of murder. The Appellant was acquitted from the 2nd charge"
"and the 4th accused was acquitted from the case."
"In his solitary ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the evidence of"
"sole  eyewitness  PW2  fails  the  test  of  credibility,  probability  and  does  not"
"inspire the confidence of the Court."
"The Counsel appearing for the Appellant mainly argued that the evidence of"
"sole eyewitness does not inspire the confidence of the Court as it fails the"
"test of credibility and probability. Hence, it is very important to consider the"
"evidence given by PW2 who had been the sole eyewitness to this case."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in  his  judgment  had  concluded  that  the"
"evidence  of  PW2 
is  convincing  and  proved  the  murder  charge  beyond"
"reasonable doubt."
"Eyewitness  testimony 
is  one  of  the  most 
important  kinds  of  criminal"
"evidence. In criminal cases, the judges regularly face the difficult but crucial"
"task of evaluating eyewitness’s testimony. This sometimes means checking"
"whether  the  witness’s  story  fits  with  other  established  facts  of  the  case."
"However, the veracity of such a story cannot always be verified or falsified"
"directly.  In  such  cases  judges  will  have  to  look  at  whether  the  statement"
"comes from a reliable source."
"Further, an eyewitness’s testimony is probably the most persuasive form of"
"evidence  presented  in  court,  but  in  many  cases,  its  accuracy  is  dubious."
"There 
is  also  evidence  that  mistaken  eyewitness  evidence  can 
lead  to"
"wrongful conviction sending people to prison for years or decades, even to"
"death row, for crimes they did not commit."
