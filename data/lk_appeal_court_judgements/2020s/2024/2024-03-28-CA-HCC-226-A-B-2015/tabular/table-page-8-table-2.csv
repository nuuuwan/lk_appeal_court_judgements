"In M.K.Francis Alwis v The Queen 70 NLR 558 the court held that:"
"“Where, after the cases for the prosecution and the defence have been"
"closed,  the  Court,  purporting  to  act  under  section  429  of  the  Criminal"
"Procedure Code, calls a fresh witness whose name appears on the list of"
"witnesses  contained  in  the  indictment,  it  would  be  wrong  to  direct  the"
"jurors that the fresh evidence may be relied upon, either by itself or as"
"corroboration of the evidence of the principal witness for the prosecution,"
"to convict the accused”."
