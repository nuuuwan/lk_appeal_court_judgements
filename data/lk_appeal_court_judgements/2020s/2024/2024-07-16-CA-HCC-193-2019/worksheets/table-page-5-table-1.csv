"When a criminal charge is forwarded against an accused  person, the cardinal"
"rule  in  criminal  law  is  that  proving  the  charge  against  the  accused  is  the"
"responsibility  of  the  prosecution  and  it  has  to  be  proved  beyond  a  reasonable"
"doubt."
"In  the  instant  matter,  the  cross  examination  by  the  defence  and  the  material"
"taken  up  in  the  dock  statement  and  the  defence  witnesses  has  not  created  a"
"reasonable doubt in the case of the prosecution."
"The  grounds  of  appeal  taken  up  by  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  is  that  the"
"improbability  in  the  case  for  the  prosecution  and  that  the  defence  had  been"
"rejected  by  the  trial  judge  due  to  a  minor  contradiction  in  the  defence’s  case."
"But upon consideration of the evidence led by both parties, I observed that the"
"story of the prosecution has stood the test of the probability satisfactorily and"
"the trial judge has evaluated the same accordingly. Therefore, we see no merit"
"in the first ground of appeal. The second ground of appeal is the fact that the"
"trial  judge  had  rejected  the  defence  case  due  to  minor  contradictions  but  we"
"observe that the defence witness, that is the wife of the accused, had omitted to"
"state some of the facts mentioned by the accused in the dock statement and in"
"the  cross  examination  put  to  the  witness  of  the  prosecution.Therefore,  this"
"court is of the opinion that the trial judge is correct in rejecting the Defence’s"
"case. As such, we see no merit in the second ground of appeal taken up by the"
"accused-appellant."
"As such, there is no reason to set aside the conviction and sentence entered by"
"the trial judge, hence, the instant appeal is dismissed and the conviction and"
"the sentence of the appellant is hereby affirmed."
