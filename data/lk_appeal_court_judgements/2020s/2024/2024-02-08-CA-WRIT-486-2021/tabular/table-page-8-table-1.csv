"“The phrase ""the common law"" seems at first a little bewildering in use because it is always used"
"to point a contrast, and its precise meaning depends upon the contrast that is being pointed. An"
"analogy may perhaps make this clearer. Take the word ""layman."" In the foregoing paragraph"
"the word was used to mean a person who is not a lawyer. But when we speak of ecclesiastics and"
"laymen, we mean by ""laymen"" non-ecclesiastics. When we speak of doctors and laymen, we mean"
"by  ""laymen""  non-doctors.  Laymen,  in  short,  are  people  who  do  not  belong  to  the  particular"
"profession that we are speaking of. Again, take ""aliens."" In England if we speak of "" aliens"" we"
"generally  mean  by  that  word  people  who  are  not  British  subjects.  But  in  France  the  French"
"equivalent  of  the  word  would  mean  people  who  are  not  French  subjects,  and  so  on  for  other"
"countries."
"It is somewhat similar with ""the common law."" (1) Originally this meant the law that was not"
"local  law,  that  is,  the  law  that  was  common  to  the  whole  of  England.  This  may  still  be  its"
"meaning in a particular context, but it is not the usual meaning. More usually the phrase will"
"signify (2) the law that is not the result of legislation, that is, the law created by the custom of the"
"people and decisions of the judges. Within certain narrow limits, popular custom creates law,"
"and so (within much wider limits) do the decisions of the courts, which we call precedents. When"
"the phrase "" the common law"" is used in this sense it may include even local law (in the form of"
"local custom), which in meaning (1) is not common law. Again, (3) the phrase may mean the"
"law that is not equity; in other words it may mean the law developed by the old courts of common"
"law  as  distinct  from  the  system  (technically  called  ""  equity"")  developed  by  the  old  Court  of"
"Chancery.  In  this  sense  ""the  common  law""  may  even  include  statutory  modifications  of  the"
"common law, though in the previous sense it does not. Finally, (4) it may mean the law that is"
"not foreign law-in other words, the law of England, or of other countries (such as America) that"
"have adopted English law. In this sense it is contrasted with (say) Roman law or French law,"
"and in this sense it includes the whole of English law— even local customs, legislation and equity."
"It will thus be seen that the precise shade of meaning in which this chameleon phrase is used"
"depends upon the particular context, and upon the contrast that is being made. When I said in"
"the second sentence of this chapter that our law is made up of common law, equity and legislation,"
"I meant it in a mixture of senses (2) and (3), as the context itself showed.”"
