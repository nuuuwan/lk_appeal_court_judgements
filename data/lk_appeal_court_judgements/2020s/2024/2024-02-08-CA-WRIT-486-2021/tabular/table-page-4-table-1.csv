"It is noted that this Court has pronounced the Judgement of the above Lanka Canneries case"
"analyzing the purported argument that the employer has a right to terminate the services of"
"the  probationer  without  assigning  any  reason  and  that  the  probationer  has  no  right  to  be"
"confirmed in his service. In such analysis, this Court has well considered the judgments of"
"Hettiarachchi vs. Vidyalankara University 76 NLR 47, Ceylon Cement Corporation vs. Fernando"
"(1990) 1 Sri. L.R. 361, Priyadarshana and two others vs. Lanka Ports Authority (2008) 2 Sri. L.R."
"208,  Moosajees  Limited  vs.  Rasiah  (1986)  1  Sri.  L.R.  365,  Brown  &  Company  Limited  vs."
"Samarasekara (1996) 1 Sri. L.R. 334, 335, Liyanagamage vs. Road Construction and Development"
"Private Limited (1994) 2 Sri. L.R. 230, State Distilleries Corporation vs. Rupasinghe (1994) 2 Sri."
"L.R. 395., Ceylon Ceramic Corporation vs. Premadasa (1986) 1 Sri. L.R. 287 which were cited"
"on behalf of the said Lanka Canneries."
"In arriving at the above decisions in the Lanka Canneries case the Court has considered the"
"nature of an employee on probation. A similar approach has been taken by this Court even in"
"the case of K. A. D. T. Kulawansa v. University of Moratuwa and Others CA/WRIT/111/2022"
"decided on 17.11.2022. Having regard to this approach, Court has further decided in the Lanka"
"Canneries case:"
