"considered as composites of the modern South African Law."
"""Following in the grand tradition of the text writers of the Roman-Dutch era, our great South"
"African judges have built and are continuing to build out of the two components of our law a"
"legal system which is adapted to the conditions of South Africa, eschewing both the archaisms of"
"the old Dutch law and the technicalities of the English law. And it can confidently be expected"
"that as our own body of jurisprudence grows, reference to the old writers will become less and less"
"necessary. It has been rightly said that the law of any country can be found in the last thirty years"
"of its law reports. This stage of certainty has not as yet been reached in South Africa, but the time"
"is undoubtedly approaching when reference to the old writers will be the exception rather than"
"the rule."
"South African law today is no longer an importation from Holland or England or any other"
"country, but a sturdy indigenous growth with its roots firmly in the soil of South Africa. It is"
"South African law, ""made by South Africans for South Africans"". We may as well get used to"
"calling  it  by  its  proper  name.  ""I  consider""  said  Classen,  J.P.  in  R.v.Goseb,4  ""that  the  term"
"'Roman-Dutch Law' is confusing, for in fact the common law of the Union or for that matter of"
"the Cape of Good Hope is not Roman-Dutch law. It is South African common law""."
