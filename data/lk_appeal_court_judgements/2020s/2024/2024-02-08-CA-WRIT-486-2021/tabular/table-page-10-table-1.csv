"legislature and the judges, the traditional definitions given to the phrase Common Law (which"
"are distinct to each other) should be constructively redefined. In this regard, L.J.M. Cooray5"
"emphasizes that the case of ""Kodeeswaran v. The Attorney General 6 is a pointer which could"
"enable the legal fraternity in Sri Lanka to move away from the old formulation of the Roman-"
"Dutch law as the common law, and to think in terms not of Roman-Dutch or English law and"
"of  the  antithesis  between  Roman-Dutch  law  and  English  law  in  our  legal  system  -  and  to"
"recognize that there is a body of law, in the decisions of our courts, a body of law not English"
"nor Roman-Dutch but which is the creation of our courts and which in Lord Diplock's words"
"in the Kodeeswaran case may be called 'the indigenous common law' of Sri Lanka."""
"It is paramount to note that Lord Diplock has recognized in the said Kodeeswaran case the"
"power of the Courts to develop the law to suit changing circumstances and also give effect to"
"a local practice without abruptly applying the Roman-Dutch or English rules7. Anyhow, when"

"of workmen who are on probation.  I am unable to find any material to support the Petitioner's"
"claim that the law governing the workmen on probation in Sri Lanka is the Roman-Dutch"
"Law or the alleged Common Law."
"In other words, the Petitioner has not enlightened Court as to what test should be applied to"
"determine whether or not the probationers fall outside the purview of TEWA. Furthermore,"
"the absence of a series of express and unbroken decisions of Court which favor the proposition"
"that the Roman-Dutch Law governs the law relating to the probationers in this country is also"
"an important factor. It is a puzzle to me as to how this Court could jump into a conclusion"
"on the applicability of Roman-Dutch law in the instant Application based on the judgements"
"cited by the Petitioner which merely refers to the term 'Roman-Dutch Law' or the 'Common"
