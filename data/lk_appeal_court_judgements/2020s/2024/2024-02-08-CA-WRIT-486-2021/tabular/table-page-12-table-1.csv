"the said formula for payment of compensation bestowed the Commissioner a discretion to a"
"considerable extent when deciding the amount of compensation within the range given in the"
"said  formula.  Hence,  I  am  not  inclined  to  go  into  an  in-depth  examination  upon  the  said"

"Petitioner."
"Application is dismissed."
