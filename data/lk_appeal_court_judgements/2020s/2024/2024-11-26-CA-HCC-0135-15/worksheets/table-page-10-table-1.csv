"b.  in R. H. M. S. Prematunga alias Ananda v. AttorneyGeneral,CA",""
"","01/2013, decided 
on  31/01/2014, 
Justice  Sisira  De  Abrew"
"","referring to Section 165 of the Criminal Procedure Act opined that"
"","the  charge  must, 
inter  alia,  specify  the  time  and  place  of  the"
"","offence. and held further, that “…. when a charge specifies that the"
"","Accused  committed  the  offence  during  a  period  and  the  evidence"
"","shows that the offence was not committed during the said period the"
"","Accused  cannot  be  convicted. 
In  such  a  situation 
it  cannot  be"
"","contended  that  the  Accused  was  not  prejudiced  because  the  idea"
"","behind specifying the time and place of offence, as I pointed earlier,"
"","is to give sufficient opportunity to the Accused to answer the charge"
"","and to ensure a fair trial.”;"
"c.","then the Indian cases of A.N. Mukergi v. State [A.I.R 1969 All 489"
"","at  page  496]  and  Ram  Asrey  v.  Stateof  U.P.  [1982  A.L.J.  1138]"
"","which determined that, ‘the charge to state the offence and contain"
"","particulars  as  to  the  time  and  place  of  the  alleged  offence  and  the"
"","person against whom it was committed, is important.’;"
"d.  Sukhdev v. State M.P. [1995(2) Crimes 336 at 337] where it held",""
"","that, “Time of the commission of offence is of great significance……"
"","counsel for the complainant fairly conceded that there is substantial"
"","defect 
in 
the 
framing  of 
the  charge  when 
the 
timing  has  been"
"","misquoted.”; and"
"e.","in the case of Attorney General v. Viraj Aponso and Others, SC"
"","24/2008, it was held that, “It is clear that it is the responsibility of"
"","the  prosecution  to  inform  the  time,  place  and  the  offence  clearly  to"
"","the  person  who 
is  charged. 
It 
is 
fundamental 
for 
the  Accused-"
"","Appellant  to  formulate  his  defence………    If  the  accused  wants  to"
"","take up the defence of alibi, he cannot do so because there is no due"
"","date or time given.”"
