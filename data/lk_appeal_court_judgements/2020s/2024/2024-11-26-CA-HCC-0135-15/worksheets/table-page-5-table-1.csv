"Thereafter, the parents had confronted the appellant and had tried to get him"
"to marry her whilst he had not done so."
"Therefore,  the  instant  complaint  had  been  lodged  on  03.07.2007.  The  cousin"
"and the parents of the victim had given evidence and they had corroborated the"
"victim  (pages  337-391,  393  and  394,  422-424,  427,  433,  450  and  457  of  the"
"brief)."
"The  doctor  who  had  examined  the  victim  had  done  so  in  July,  2007  and  the"
"victim,  in  the  history  given  to  the  doctor,  had  said  that  she  had  a  sexual"
"relationship with a person known to her and that she got an abortion done on"
"2006.06.26. She had not stated the name of the culprit to the doctor."
"Hence, if that is so and on considering evidence with regard to her missing her"
"menstrual cycle twice and the date of her first complaint, a great doubt arises"
"with regard to the time period stated in the indictment."
"Hence, it has to be concluded that there is a reasonable doubt with regard to"
"the  date  of  the  offence  upon  considering  the  case  history  by  the  victim  to  the"
"doctor, which the learned trial judge had not adverted his mind to at all."
"Furthermore, the appellant has given evidence and had said that at the time of"
"the  offence  he  had  been  working  in  the  Pradeshiya  Sabha  in  Trincomalee.  He"
"had known the victims’ cousin’s husband and that he brought him a proposal"
"in  2006  and  that  he  liked  it  at  the  beginning  but  later  changed  his  mind"
"because he got to know that she was having a relationship with a person called"
"Nihal (pages 519-521 of the brief)."
"He had completely denied of having any kind of sexual act with the victim and"
"had  said,  in  fact,  that  he  was  working  on  26th  and  27th  of  June  in  2006  on"
"which days  the victim had alleged that she went to get the abortion done with"
"the appellant and the cousin (page 523 of the brief)."
"Hence,  when  such  evidence  is  given,  the  trial  judge  has  to  analyze  whether  it"
"creates a reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution."
