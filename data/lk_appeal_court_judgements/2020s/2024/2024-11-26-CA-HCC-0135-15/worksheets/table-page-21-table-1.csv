It  is  now  accepted  that  there  must  be  fairness  to  all  sides.  In  a"
"criminal  case  this  requires  the  court  to  consider  a 
‘triangulation  of"
"interests.’  It  involves  taking  into  account  the  interests  of  the  victim  and"
"his or her family, and the public in considering and deciding the right to"
"a  fair  trial  from  the  perspective  of  an  accused.  You  must  be  mindful  of"
"the interest of the society and ensure that the criminal justice system is"
"not  made  ineffective  or  that  would  make  the  prevention  of  a  serious"
"social problem almost impossible."
