"","frame  of  the  allegations.  The  court  cited  precedents  such  as  R  v."
"","Dossi 13 Cr. App. R. 158 and Wright v. Nicholson 54 Cr. App. R. 38"
"","affirming that precise dates are not mandatory unless they impact"
"","the fairness of the trial."
"c.","In Keerawella Palliyaguruge Dinesh Indika v. Attorney General,"
"","CA/88/2013, where the Appellant was informed of the time frame"
"","(a month’s period from September 5, 2003, to October 5, 2003) and"
"","denied entering the victim’s house during that period, Justice K. K."
"","Wickramasinghe  held  that  this  time  range  in  the  indictment  was"
"","adequate  and  did  not  prejudice  the  Appellant’s  defense,  affirming"
"","that  minor  uncertainties  about  exact  dates  do  not  necessarily"
"","undermine the fairness of a trial. The court acknowledged that the"
"","victim,  a  young  child,  could  not  provide  exact  dates 
for 
the"
"","repeated  incidents  of  sexual  abuse,  but  it  found  that  this  did  not"
"","prejudice the Appellant's defense."
"d.  In  Jayawardana  v.  Attorney  General,  CA/HCC/0431/2019,  the",""
"","timeframe  of  the  offence  spanned  for  a  month’s  period  (between"
"","December 1 and December 31, 2009). Justice Priyantha Fernando"
"","found  that,  in  cases  involving  sexual  offences  against  children,"
"","where it may be challenging for child victims to recall exact dates,"
"","the  given  time  frame  did  not  harm  the  Appellant’s  defense,  and"
"","rejected  this  ground  of  appeal,  particularly  because  the  Appellant"
"","did not present an alibi or evidence that a specific date would have"
"","changed his defense."
"e.  Siripala  v.  Attorney  General,  CA/HCC/0156/18,  further  states",""
"","that an indictment's date range (for three offences during a period"
"","of one year from October 11, 2004, to October 10, 2005) is valid if"
"","it  does  not  mislead  the  Accused  or  affect  the  fairness  of  the  trial."
"","The court found no error in the time frame given in the indictment,"
"","as it was reasonably sufficient for the Appellant to understand the"
"","charges and prepare a defense."
