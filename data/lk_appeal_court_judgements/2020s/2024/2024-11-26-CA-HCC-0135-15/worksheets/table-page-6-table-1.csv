"Already the date of offence in the indictment has not been subject to doubt and"
"this is further so upon considering the details in the case history given to the"
"doctor  victim.  This 
is 
further  aggravated  by 
the  stand 
taken  up  by 
the"
"appellant."
"But the learned trial judge had merely rejected the position of the appellant on"
"the  basis  that  the  witnesses  of  the  prosecution  were  not  cross-examined  on"
"those points. (pages 565-571 of the brief)."
"Therefore, upon considering the above mentioned matter on law and facts it is"
"abundantly clear that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable"
"doubt the date on which the offence has taken place, there by violating one of"
"the fundamental requirements of criminal law."
"It is the fundamental duty of the prosecution that they prove their case beyond"
"a  reasonable  doubt  and  the  constituents  in  the  charge  have  to  be  proved"
"beyond a reasonable doubt which includes the date of the offence."
"In the instant case, the prosecution had not clearly done so and the trial judge"
"had been very naïve to the said short comings in the case for the prosecution"
"case."
"Furthermore, 
the  Counsel 
for 
the  appellant  has 
raised 
in  his  written"
"submissions  that  although  the  charge  in  the  indictment  has  referred  to  only"
"one  act  of  rape  and  the  prosecution  leading  the  evidence  pertaining  to  three"
"acts  of  rape  whether  it  violates  the  provisions  of  section  54  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance."
"At this point I wish to draw my attention to the explanation 1 of section  54 of"
"the Evidence Ordinance where it has been said that,"
"“This  section  does  not  apply  to  cases  in  which  the  bad  character  of  any"
"person is itself a fact in issue.”"
