"an  offence  occurred  is  not  fatal  unless  time  is  an  essential  part  of  the"
"offence charged and the accused is misled or prejudiced by any variation"
"in time that arises.  It is generally the case that a charge may be proven if"
"the evidence discloses the commission of the offence within the time period"
"specified  in  the  particular  count  of  the  indictment.   The  accused  must  be"

No doubt the right to a fair trial requires that every person charged"
"with a criminal offence must be informed in a language which he or she"
"understands  of  the  charges  against  him,  with  details  being  given  as  to"
"the  facts  and  the  law  on  which  the  charge  is  based.  This  information"
"must allow the accused person to effectively prepare his or her defence."
"In  the  criminal  justice  context,  the  right  to  a  fair  trial,  more  often  than"
"not  exclusively,  focuses  on  ensuring  fairness  to  the  accused.  However,"
"courts  in  other  jurisdictions  have  acknowledged  that  considering  the"
"right  to  a  fair  trial  court  should  also  be  mindful  of  the  interests  of  the,"
"victims/witnesses  and  the  community/public  as  well.  This  approach  is"
