"4.  Upon citing and referring to the above decisions, Justice Wijesundera in",""
"","Baiya  Dewayalage  Sugathapala  alias  Sugathe  Seeya  v.  Attorney"
"General  (supra)  concludes  thus;  “Therefore,  in  the","instant  matter  the"
"","Appellant has been charged for the period of 01-04-2014 to 16-10-2014 as"
"","per 165(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is no specific time or a"
"","date  given  by  the  prosecution  for  the  Appellant  to  formulate  his  defence"
"","which denies a fair trial. Therefore, considering all the proceedings during"
"","the  trial,  the  oral  and  written  submissions  of  both  parties,  I  find  that  the"
"","Accused-Appellant was never given a specific date/period of the offence as"
"per  the  provisions  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure.  Hence","it 
is  the"
"opinion of this court that the Appellant did not have a charge to answer.”",""
