"16.","The  argument  is  that,  it  is  only  for  such  offences  under  Section"
"","165  (2)  that  the  prosecution  is  not  required  to  specify  a  precise  date  of"
"","offence; and that it is only in respect of the offences of criminal breach of"
"trust  or  dishonest  misappropriation","to  which 
the  said  sub-section"
"","applies  that  a  time  period  may  be  stated.  It  is  thus  argued  that  in  all"
"","other cases to which Section 165 (1) applies, the precise time (date) of the"
"","alleged offence must be specifically stated in the charge."
