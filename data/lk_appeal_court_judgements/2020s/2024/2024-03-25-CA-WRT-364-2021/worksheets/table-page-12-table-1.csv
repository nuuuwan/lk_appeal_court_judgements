"It was the contention of the learned Presidentâ€™s counsel for the Petitioner that in any event"
"the  findings  and  recommendations  and  material  collected  are  grossly  unreasonable.  The"
"findings and recommendations and material collected are nowhere in the vicinity of such that"
"could be arrived at by a reasonably prudent person. On behalf of the Petitioner, he further"
"submits that to put it in the famous words of Lord Diplock, the findings and recommendations"
"so outrageous in its defiance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person"
"who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it."
"The evidence of this Petitioner, before the Commission has been clear in that, inter alia;"
"a.  The  Anti-Corruption  Committee"
