"Availability of Certiorari and Prohibition"
"“The circumstances in which certiorari and prohibition will be available have been"
"summed up by Lord Justice Atkin, an English judge, in the following famous words"
"which on numerous occasions have been cited and followed by our courts:"
"""
 Whenever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions"
"a
f
fecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially, act in excess"
"o
f
 
their legal authority they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of the King's"
"Bench Division exercised in these Writs."""
"This  dictum  has  been analyzed  as  follows  as  laying  down  four  conditions  which"
"must be satisfied for certiorari or prohibition to issue:-"
"""
 Whenever any body of persons, (firstly) having legal authority, (secondly) to"
"determine questions affecting the rights of subjects, (thirdly) having the duty to"
"act judicially, (fourthly) act in excess of their legal authority, they are subject to"
"the controlling jurisdiction exercised by these writs."""

"Commissioners case have been advanced by judicial decisions. It is no longer the"
"duty to act judicially or quasi-judicially which attracts review [by certiorari] but"
"the 'duty to act fairly'"".  ""The concept of a duty to act fairly irrespective of whether"
"the  body  is  acting 
judicially  or  quasi-judicially  or  administratively  has  been"
"stressed 
in  recent  decisions  of  the  Courts 
in  England..  Over  the  years  the"
"requirement of ""having the duty to act judicially has lost its meaning as a separate"
"requirement  for  the  availability  of  certiorari.  Unlike  the  duty  to  act  judicially"
"which arises when a determination of rights is involved, the duty to act fairly arises"
"whenever the party against whom a decision, determination or report is to be made"
"will suffer serious consequences by it. The content of the duty to act judicially is"
"the same as the content of the duty to act fairly.”"
