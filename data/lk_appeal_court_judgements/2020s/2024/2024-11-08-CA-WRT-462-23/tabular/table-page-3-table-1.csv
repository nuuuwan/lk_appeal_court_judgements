"D.  Grant any other relief Your Lordships’ Court deem meet"
"The facts of this case are briefly as follows:"
"According  to  the  petition,  there  was  a  Voluntary Retirement  Scheme introduced  to  the"
"employees of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) in the year of 2016 by the Circular"
"dated  31.05.2016  marked as P2. Under the said scheme, the  2nd  Respondent who was  59"
"years  old  made  an  application.  There  was  another  Circular  issued  dated  16.08.2016"
"(marked as P3) for the entitlement of gratuity."
"The 2nd Respondent made an application to the Labour Commissioner on the basis that"
"the Petitioner had not properly calculated the gratuity and the compensation which was"
"due to him based on the said Circulars."
"This matter was later referred to the Arbitrator who made an Award on 09.09.2024 which"
"is marked as ‘X’. According to the Arbitrator (the 1st Respondent), he has calculated the"
"compensation and gratuity on the basis that, on the retirement, the 2nd Respondent was"
"drawing  a  salary  of  Rs.  57,  726.  Thereafter,  on  that  basis,  he  has  calculated  and"
"determined the amounts to be paid by the Petitioner to the 2nd Respondent."
"The main ground urged by the Petitioner is that the last drawn salary includes a RAT"
"allowance which is a special allowance temporarily paid to the employees. According to"
"the  Petitioner,  this  is  an  incentive  payment  by  the  Chairman  of  SLTB.  Therefore,  the"
"Arbitrator  had  made  a mistake  by  including  the said  amount  in  the  last  drawn  salary"
"which is against the interpretation of ‘wages and salary’ as mentioned in the Gratuity Act."
"When we peruse the Circulars marked P2 and P3, it is clearly indicated that,"
