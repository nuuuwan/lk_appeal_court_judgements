"Circulars Pertinent to the Age of Retirement of the Employees of Petitioner"
"Bank"
"As  per  the  letter  of  appointment[X1]  of  the  2nd  Respondent,  the  age  of"
"retirement is 55 years. However, subsequently, the age of retirement was"
"amended or varied by Circulars bearing No. SCL 2001/10 dated 13th March"
"2001[X4], No. SCL 2008/043 dated 19th September 2008[X2] and No. SCL"
"2009/003 dated 19 March 2009[X3]. It is on common ground that the 2nd"
"Respondent reached the age of 55 years on the 28th of May 2016. At the"
"time when the 2nd Respondent reached the age of 55 years, the existing"
"Circular  applicable  on  the  age  of  retirement  of  the  employees  of  the"
"Petitioner Bank was Circular X3. As per Circular X3, the age of retirement"
"was  set  as  55  years  giving  effect  to  the  relevant  Public  Administration"
"Circular. Further, Circular X3 stipulates that extensions would be granted"
"to the employees annually until they reach the age of 57 years subject to"
"evaluation of performances and the discretion of the Management. The"
"extension for highly skilled employees who could not be easily replaced"
"and  who  will  contribute  to  the  bottom  line  directly  could  be  granted"
"annually until they reach the age of 60 years. Further, Circular X3 expressly"
"rescinded Circular X2 by which the age of retirement was extended to the"
"age  of  58  years.  Therefore, 
the  Petitioner  contends 
that 
the  2nd"
"Respondent  ceased  to  be  an  employee  of  the  Petitioner  Bank  upon"
"reaching  the  age  of  55  years  as  per  Circular  X3  and  no  termination  of"
"services had occurred."
"Public Administration Circular"
"The  Respondents  argue 
that  Circular  X3  does  not  determine 
the"
"Petitioner’s retirement age for several reasons. The Respondents point out"
"that Circular X3 was introduced to the Petitioner Bank to give effect to a"
"Public Administration Circular and was issued unilaterally by the Petitioner"
"without consulting or obtaining consent from the employees. It is stated"
"that the Public Administration Circulars do not apply to the Petitioner Bank."
"Though  the  2nd  Respondent  has  taken  up  the  position  that  the  Public"
"Administration Circulars do not apply to the Petitioner Bank, it is significant"
"to  observe  the  employee’s  union  has  taken  a  contrary  stand  and  has"
"requested  the  Bank  to  act 
in 
line  with  another  Public  Administration"
"Circular by letter R2(1). However, the Petitioner Bank conceded that being"
"a  private  sector  Bank  it  need  not  be  guided  by  Public  Administration"
"Circulars issued from time to time and the decision to give effect to Public"
