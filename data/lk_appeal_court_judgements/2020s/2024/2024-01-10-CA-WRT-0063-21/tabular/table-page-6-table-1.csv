"membership  due 
to 
the  purported  reason  of  encroaching 
the  upper  portion  of 
the"
"Nilanthattuwa  tank.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  Commissioner-General  or  any  other"
"relevant officer can inquire into any complaint of such encroachment and take necessary"
"legal action according to law. On the other hand, according to the Constitution marked"
"‘M’ the Organisation is empowered to disenroll any member upon any ground mentioned"
"in its Clause 14. It is observed that no evidence has been placed before this Court that the"
"4th Petitioner has been found guilty of any such complaint."
"Moreover, 
the  attention  of 
the  Court  has  been  drawn 
to 
the  case  bearing  No."
"CA/Writ/355/2021 in which the above-named Petitioners have challenged the decision"
"of the Commissioner-General of Agrarian Development contained in the impugned letter"
"(in the said case) dated 14.06.2021, marked P9.  The Commissioner- General by such letter"
"has decided to call for information in view of taking future steps to evict any unauthorized"
"occupants (vide- order dated 22.03.2022 marked ‘P24’- annexed to the Counter Affidavit)."
"This Court has refused the said application because the Petitioners were unable to establish"
"that their rights had been affected due to the said impugned letter. In any case, the said"
"impugned letter reflects the fact that the Commissioner-General has not yet decided on the"
"purported unauthorized occupation of the upper portion of the Nilanthattuwa tank, which"
"is the basis for the Organisation's denial of the 4th Petitioner's membership. Thus, I observe"
"that  the  refusal  to  grant  such  membership  did  not  stem  from  any  issue  relating  to  the"
"criteria that need to be met in order to be eligible for membership in the Organisation."
"Apart from the claims that the 4th Petitioner is occupying the upper part of the said tank"
"without authorization, the 1st and 4th Petitioners are accused of something else based on"
"their  respective  vocations.  The  1st to  4th  Respondents  contend  that  the  1st Petitioner  is  a"
"Doctor of Medicine whilst the 4th Petitioner is a Chairman of a company and thus, neither"
"of  them  meets  the  requirement  of  being  a  ""farmer""  which  is  allegedly  a  requisite  for"
"membership. In terms of section 43(4)(c) engaging in agricultural activities in the area of"
"authority 
for  a  period  exceeding 
two  years 
is  sufficient  among  other  grounds 
for"
"membership eligibility."
"Especially during the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa eras, historical sources evince that"
"the  reigning  Monarch  participated  or  provided  patronage  in  agricultural  activities  to"
"ensure 
the  prosperous 
island  nation  was  self-sufficient.  Hence, 
it 
is  my  view 
that"
"irrespective of social status or vocation, any individual should be at liberty to engage in"
