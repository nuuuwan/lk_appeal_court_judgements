"JMO who testified before the Court as to the ability of the deceased to talk after"
"receiving injuries that led to his death, and has given clear evidence that a person"
"of physical strength and age such as the deceased, could have spoken up to half"
"an hour or one hour after the injuries caused to him. He has been specific as to"
"the injuries that had been caused to the diaphragm of the deceased explaining"
"that the injuries in that area were superficial and the deceased had the ability to"
"speak with such injuries."
"I do not find any reason to believe that the witnesses were not telling the truth"
"about what they heard from the deceased. When considering the evidence of the"
"JMO and the two Post-Mortem Reports relating to the two deceased persons, it"
"becomes clear that the cut injuries have been caused using a heavy sharp cutting"
"instrument. It is clear that all the injuries caused to the two persons had been"
"caused by using a single weapon, which clearly allies with the dying declaration"

"at that time of the day along with the 1st accused indicted."
"The  learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  contended  that  there  was  insufficient  light"
"conditions  for  the  wife  of  the  deceased  to  positively  identify  the  assailants  as"
"claimed by her in her evidence, although she may have seen somebody running"
"away.  It  was  also  contended  that  there was  a  doubt  as  to whether  the  PW-01"
"knew the appellant sufficiently for her to identify him in such light conditions."
