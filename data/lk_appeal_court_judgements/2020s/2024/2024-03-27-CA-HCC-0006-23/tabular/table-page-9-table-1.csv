"reached  home,  he  met  his  mother  in  his  house  and  the  mother  informed  him"
"that the deceased persons have been attacked, and Heman is also not at home"
"and to go and bring him. Since he could not do that, he left the area in his three-"
"wheeler and went to his wife’s house. Since there was insufficient space in the"
"house, he went to a neighbour’s house and slept."
"According to him, he has come to know that he is a suspect in the case where"
"the  deceased  were  killed,  and  later  surrendered  to  the  police.  He  has  claimed"
"that the evidence given by the PW-01 stating that  she saw  him running  away"
"was  a  lie,  and  has  claimed  that  he  was  unaware  of  this  incident  and  had  no"
"connection whatsoever."
"On behalf of the appellant, the person called Sisira mentioned by him in his dock"
"statement has been called to give evidence. He has claimed that on the day of"
"the incident, the 3rd appellant came to his shop around 8.30 in the night and"
"inquired whether he is attending the funeral at the village, for which he stated"
"he  would  do  so  after  closing  his  shop.  He  has  claimed  that  thereafter,  the"
"appellant went and brought some liquor and consumed it in his shop. He has"
"stated that around 10.00 - 10.30 in the night, the appellant’s mother came to"
"the shop and wanted him to come with her, at which point the appellant left his"
"shop. Under cross-examination, he has claimed that he did not know about the"
"incident where two persons have died in his village."
"It  appears  from  what  the  appellant  had  stated  in  his  dock  statement  and  the"
"evidence of the witness called on his behalf that the appellant has attempted to"
"claim an alibi."
