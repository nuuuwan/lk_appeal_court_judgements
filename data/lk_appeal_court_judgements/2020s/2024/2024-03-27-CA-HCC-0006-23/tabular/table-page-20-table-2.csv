"having considered several legal principles and judgements in relation to how the"
"trial Court should test an alibi observed as follows;"
"“An alibi is not an exception to criminal liability like a plea of private defence"
"or  grave  and  sudden  provocation.  An  alibi 
is  nothing  more 
than  an"
"evidentiary  fact,  which  like  other  facts  relied  on  by  an  accused  must  be"
"weighed in the scale against the case for the prosecution. In a case where"
"an alibi is pleaded, if the prisoner succeeds thereby in creating a sufficient"
"doubt in the minds of the Jury as to whether he was present at the scene at"
"the 
time 
the  offence  was 
committed, 
then 
the  prosecution  has  not"
"established  its  case  beyond  all  reasonable  doubt,  and  the  accused  is"
"entitled to be acquitted- Rex vs. Chandrasekera (1942) 44 NLR at page"
"126 and Rex vs. Fernando (1947) 48 NLR at page 251. Although the"
"learned Judge did not deal with the alibi in this way, a study of the evidence"
"shows 
that  no  miscarriage 
of 
justice 
resulted 
thereby.  There  are"
"contradictions between the evidence of the second accused and his witness"
"Premasiri which may have induced the Jury to reject the alibi. In regard to"
"the case against the second accused there was ample evidence before the"
"Jury,  which,  if  believed,  justified  the  verdict  which  they  returned.  We"
"therefore  think  the  conviction  of  the  second  accused  is  justified  and  we"
"dismiss his application.”"
