"J. in the case of Martin Singho Vs. Queen 69 CLW 21 at page 22, remarked"
"as follows;"
"“As  this  Court  has  pointed  out  on  many  occasions  in  the  past,  where  an"
"accused person is not relying on a general or special exception contained in"
"the Penal Code, there is no burden on him to establish any fact. In this case,"
"the appellant not relying on any such exception; even if the Jury declined to"
"believe the appellant’s version, he was yet entitled to be acquitted on the"
"charge if his version raised in the mind of the Jury a reasonable doubt as to"
"the truth of the prosecution case.”"
