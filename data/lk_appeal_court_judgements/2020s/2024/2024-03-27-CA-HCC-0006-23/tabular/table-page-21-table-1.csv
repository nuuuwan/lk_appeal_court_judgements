"I  find  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  well  considered  whether  this"
"question of fact of an alibi raised by the appellant has created any doubt in the"
"prosecution case and had determined that it was not so. That determination had"
"been  reached  after  evaluating  the  relevant  evidence  in  its  correct  perspective."
"Hence, I am in no reason to disagree with the reasons given by the learned High"
"Court Judge in that regard."
"For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the second  ground of"
"appeal urged on behalf of the accused-appellant."
"Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit."
"The conviction and the sentence dated 15-12-2022 by the learned High Court"
"Judge of Gampaha affirmed."
