"insufficient and doubtful evidence of the prosecution."
"2.  Defence evidence has been rejected on unreasonable grounds."
"As the two grounds of appeal urged are different to each other, I will now proceed"
"to consider the said grounds of appeal separately."
"The First Ground of Appeal:-"
"This is a matter where there were no eyewitnesses to the actual incident where"
"the deceased had received cut injuries. Therefore, the prosecution has relied on"
"the dying declarations alleged to have been made by the deceased Nimal Rohana"
"Mayadunne  to  his  wife,  who  reached  the  place  of  the  incident  soon  after  it"
"occurred, and to his elder brother PW-02, few minutes thereafter."
"It was the position of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the alleged dying"
"declarations  made  by  the  deceased  to  PW-01  and  PW-02  are  different  to  each"
"other  and  cannot  be  accepted  without  any  doubt.  It  was  his  position  that  the"
"said alleged dying declarations are not cogent enough to be believed."
"It was also his position that the claim made by PW-01, that she saw the appellant"
"running away from the place of the incident along with the other two accused"
"was  also  doubtful  and  cannot  be  believed  in  view  of  the  discrepancies  in  that"
"regard."
"He  pointed  out  that  there  was  insufficient  light  for  her  to  make  a  positive"
"identification,  even  she  may  have  seen  somebody  running  away.  It  was  his"
"position that there was insufficient evidence to establish whether the witnesses"
"knew the 3rd accused and has identified him properly at the trial."
"In  this  regard,  it  was  the  submission  of  the  learned  Senior  Deputy  Solicitor"
"General (SDSG) on behalf of the respondent that the evidence of a person treated"
"as an adverse witness cannot be taken advantage of by either party in a trial. He"
"cited  several  cases  to  support  his  contention.  It  was  his  position  that  the  two"
"dying declarations made by the deceased can be relied upon. He  submitted to"
