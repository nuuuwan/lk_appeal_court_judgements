"of the prosecution, the defence must succeed; and"
"c. 
It should not be used against another accused.”"
"It is clear from the judgement that the learned High Court Judge has looked at"
"the dock statement of the appellant with the above legal principles in mind."
"In his dock statement, the appellant has taken up an alibi to the effect that he"
"was elsewhere and consuming liquor at a shop situated in the village to suggest"
"that  he  was  not  at  the  place  of  the  incident.  He  has  called  a  witness  to"

"Penal Code."
"It  has  been  determined  that  no  doubt  has  been  created  or  a  reasonable"
