"closed,  the  2nd  accused-appellant  gave  evidence  on  oaths  and  his"
"mother was called as a defence witness."
"T
he 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for 
the  appellant  advanced  his"
"arguments  mainly  on  the  ground  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge"
"has misdirected himself on facts and law in coming to a conclusion. In"
"addition,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  contended  that  the  learned"
"Trial  Judge  had  wrongly  relied  upon  the  dying  declaration.  He  also"
"contended that even if the prosecution story is believed to be true and"
"correct,  the  accused-appellant  could  be  convicted  only  for  culpable"
"homicide not amounting to murder but not for murder."
"T
he learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that the  deceased"
"and  the  2nd  accused-appellant  were  residing  in  close  proximity,  and"
"PW-1 and PW-2 had no enmity with the 2nd accused-appellant to give"
"false evidence against him. The learned ASG contended that the learned"
"Trial Judge correctly considered the dying declaration and the evidence"
"of PW-1 and PW-2 regarding the incident and has come to the correct"
"conclusion."
"I
n this case, a dying declaration recorded by a police officer has been"
"marked as P-2. The learned High Court Judge has relied upon the dying"
"declaration  in  determining  the  action.  In  his  Judgment,  the  learned"
"Judge has extensively dealt with the legal position in accepting a dying"
"declaration as evidence of a case. The learned Judge has observed that"
"a  dying  declaration 
is  also  hearsay  evidence.  The 
legal  position"
"regarding  a  dying  declaration  stated 
in  the  Judgment 
is  correct."
"However, the legal position stated by the learned Judge regarding the"
"admissibility of hearsay evidence is incorrect. His observation regarding"
"the admissibility of hearsay evidence is as follows:"
"“සාක්ෂි  නීතියේ  සාමාන්‍ය  රීතියක්ෂ  වන්යන්  ප්‍රවාදක  සාක්ෂි  පිළි  යන්‍ාගැනීමය.  එයෙත්  එයට"
"වයතියේක  ඇත.  ප්‍රවාදක  සාක්ෂි  පිළියන්‍ාගතයොත්  යුක්ෂතිය  ඉටු  යන්‍ාවන්‍  විටද  ඒවා"
