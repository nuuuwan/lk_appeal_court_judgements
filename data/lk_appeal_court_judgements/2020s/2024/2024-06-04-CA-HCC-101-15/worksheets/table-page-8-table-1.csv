"the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  not  considered  these  matters.  He"
"accepted the dying declaration, which contradicts the evidence of PW-1"
"and PW-2 as well as the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 and concluded that"
"the charge has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As explained"
"previously,  according  to  the  medical  evidence,  this  assault  could  not"
"have  happened  in  the  way  described  by  the  deceased  in  his  dying"
"declaration. In addition, if the dying declaration is accepted, PW-1 and"
"PW-2’s  evidence  that  assault  took  place  in  the  2nd  appellant’s  house"
"cannot be believed. Without considering this vital contradiction which"
"affects the entire prosecution case, the learned Trial Judge has come to"
"the  conclusion  that  the  prosecution  has  proved  its  case  beyond  a"
"reasonable doubt."
