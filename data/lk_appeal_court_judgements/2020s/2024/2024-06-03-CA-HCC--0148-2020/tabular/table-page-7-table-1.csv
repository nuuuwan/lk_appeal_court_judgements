"CA/HCC/148/2020"
"Under the 1st ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellant contended that"
"he  Learned  High  Court  Judge  failed  to  scrutinize  the  testimony  of  sole"
"eyewitness  according  to  the  principles  established  in  law  and  failed  to"
"evaluate the creditworthiness of the said witness."
"Eyewitness  testimony  stands  as  one  of  the  paramount  types  of  criminal"
"evidence,  posing  a  challenging  yet  pivotal  task  for  judges  in  evaluating"
"criminal  cases.  This  often  entails  scrutinizing  whether 
the  witness's"
"narrative  aligns  with 
established 
facts  of 
the 
case.  However,  direct"
"verification  or  falsification  of  such  accounts  may  not  always  be  feasible."
"Consequently, judges must assess the reliability of the source."
"Moreover,  while  an  eyewitness's  testimony  holds  significant  sway  in  court"
"proceedings, 
its  accuracy 
in  numerous 
cases 
remains  questionable."
"Evidence  suggests 
that  erroneous  eyewitness  accounts  can 
result 
in"
"wrongful convictions, leading individuals to serve extended prison sentences,"
"and  in  severe  cases,  facing  capital  punishment  for  crimes  they  did  not"
"commit."
"When deliberating on eyewitness evidence, the court should consider various"
"factors, including the demeanour of the witness, the inherent plausibility of"
"the  account, 
internal  consistencies,  consistency  with  prior  statements,"
"potential biases, the compatibility of the account with crime scene evidence,"
"and  corroboration  from  other  witnesses.  These  considerations  hold  great"
"significance,  especially  considering  that  the  burden  of  proof  lies  with  the"
"prosecution in all criminal cases."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in  considering  the  evidence  given  by  PW1,"
"stated  that  his  evidence  was  corroborated  by  the  evidence  given  by  PW2."
"Although While PW2 initially stated that he witnessed the Appellant throwing"
"a  bomb  at  them,  he  later  mentioned  observing  a  person  resembling  the"
"Appellant throwing the bomb."
