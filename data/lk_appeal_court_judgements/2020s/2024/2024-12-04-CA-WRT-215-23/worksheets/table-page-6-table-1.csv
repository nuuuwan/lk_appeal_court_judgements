"According to His Lordship Tambiah J, in Hilda Perera v. Lawrence Perera (supra) at page"
"“The Debt Conciliation Ordinance was enacted to provide for the establishment of"
"a debt conciliation Board and other matters connected with the purposes for which"
"it  was  established.  It  was  clearly  a  piece  of  legislation  intended  to  give  relief  to"
"debtors. The language of Section 56 of the Ordinance is plain. It states that “no"
"civil court shall entertain any action in respect of any matter pending before the"
"Board.” By the word “matter”, is meant the particulars in the application. In my"
"view, the moment the application is received by the Board, the matters stated in"
"the  application  are  pending  before  the  Board.  Thereafter,  it  is  for  the  Board  to"
"decide as to whether they wish to entertain the application or not.”"
