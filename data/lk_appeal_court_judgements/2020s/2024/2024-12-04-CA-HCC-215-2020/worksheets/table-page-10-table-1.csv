"Volume 2, Book 1 (at page 395) where it is stated that,"
"“In  great  many  cases,  the  police  agents  are  as  a  rule"
"unreliable  witnesses.  It 
is  always 
in  their 
interest  to"
"secure a conviction in the hope of getting a reward. Such"
"evidence  ought, 
therefore, 
to  be 
received  with  great"
"caution  and  should  be  closely  scrutinised,  particularly"
"where  their  evidence  is  the  only  corroborating  evidence"
"for the evidence of the accomplice, as in bribery cases…”"
