"order was served on the petitioner on 30.04.1995.   The petitioner appealed"
"to the PSC against the VOP order.  The PSC rejected the petitioner's appeal"
"on  25.09.1995.    That  decision  has  not  been  rescinded  or  varied  by  the"
"Cabinet of Ministers.  Therefore, the decision of the PSC still stands valid in"

"T
he petitioner has made a fresh appeal to the NPC in 2003. The NPC did not"
"have  the  jurisdiction  to  entertain  such  an  appeal  and  the  NPC  had  rightly"
"withdrawn its decision later.  The AAT has rightly decided that the petitioner"
"had no right to appeal to the NPC. Since no legal right of the petitioner was"
"violated  by  the  NPC  or  the  AAT,  the  petitioner  cannot  obtain  the  reliefs"
"sought  in  the  prayer  of  the  petition.  Considering  the  above  circumstances,"
