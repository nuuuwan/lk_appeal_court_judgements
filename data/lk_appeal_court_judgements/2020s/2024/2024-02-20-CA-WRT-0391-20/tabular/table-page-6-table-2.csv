"n the case of Jayaweera Vs. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services3"
"it was observed by the Court of Appeal that,"
"“a Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a"
"Writ  of  Certiorari  is  not  entitled  to  relief  as  a  matter  of  course,  as  a"
"matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief,"
"still the Court has the discretion to deny him relief having regard to his"
"conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all valid"
"impediments which stand against the grant of relief.”"
