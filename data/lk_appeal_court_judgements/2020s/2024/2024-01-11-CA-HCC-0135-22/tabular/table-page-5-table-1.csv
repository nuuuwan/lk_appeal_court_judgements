"punished. A judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape."
"One is as important as the other. Both are public duties.‚Äù"
"As such upon considering the submissions of both sides we are of the opinion"
"that  there  is  evidence  to  say  that  the  appellant  has  caused  the  death  of  the"
"deceased in a very gruesome manner and thereafter the telemarks at the scene"
"of crime had further implicated him for the charge in the indictment."
