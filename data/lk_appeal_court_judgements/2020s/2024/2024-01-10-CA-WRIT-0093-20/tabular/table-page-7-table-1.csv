"on review is concerned only with the question whether the act or order under attack"
"should be allowed to stand or not.”"
"Since the Application at hand is a Writ Application, the Court can only consider the"
"legality of the Order of the 1st Respondent marked as P-14 and whether it should be"
"allowed to stand."
"Sub-section 1 of Section 2 of the Act provides that;"
"“No employer shall terminate the scheduled employment of any workmen without-"
"(a) prior consent in writing of the workman; or"
"(b) prior written approval of the Commissioner.”"
"Accordingly,  it  is  clear  that  if  an  employment  of  a  workman  is  terminated  without"
"obtaining prior consent of the workman or the prior approval of the Commissioner, such"
"termination is illegal, null and void and will have no effect whatsoever. In the instant"
"Application, the Company has neither obtained the consent of the 3rd Respondent nor"
"the approval of the 1st Respondent to terminate the employment of the 3rd Respondent."
"Section 5 of the Act reads as follows;"
"“where  an  employer  terminates  the  scheduled  employment  of  a  workman  in"
"contravention of the provisions of this Act, such termination shall be illegal, null"
"and void, and accordingly shall be of no effect whatsoever.”"
