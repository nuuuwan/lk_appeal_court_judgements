"Sunil F.A. Coorey in his book Principles of Administrative Law, Fourth Edition, Volume"
"II, page  916 states as follows:"
"“Power  to  decide  questions  affecting  right  of  parties  may  be  conferred  either  by"
"statute law or by contract of parties."
"The phrase “legal authority” in this context has traditionally been used  to  refer"
"only  conferred  by  statute,  to  the  exclusion  of  power  conferred    by  contract    of"
"parties.”"
