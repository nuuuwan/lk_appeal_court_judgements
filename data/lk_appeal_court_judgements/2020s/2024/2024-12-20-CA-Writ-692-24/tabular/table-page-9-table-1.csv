"CA-Writ / 0692-2024"
"continued  by  the  6th  Respondent  after  the  suspension  of  their  EPL  on"
"15.07.2024."
"Learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  6th  Respondent  moving  this  Court"
"not to extend the interim order submits to this Court that the Petitioner"
"filing  this  application  not  out  of  genuine  legal  necessity,  but  rather  to"
"serve its collateral interest and gain an undue advantage in the cement"
"industry,  where 
the  6th  Respondent  and 
the  Petitioners  are  direct"
"competitors."
"Although  the  Petitioner  submitted  that  the  EPL  was  suspended  on"
"15.07.2024,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  6th  Respondent"
"brought  to  the  notice  of  this  court  that  1st  Respondent  by  letter  dated"
"19.09.2024, informed the 5th Respondent that until a new EPL is issued,"
"the  5th  Respondent  could  continue  its  operations  on  the  terms  and"
"conditions contained in the previous license. Therefore, 6th Respondent"
"is not required to obtain a separate EPL for their raw material unloading"
"operations  within  the  premises  of  the  Hambantota  International  Port."
"Further, the 6th Respondent is not transporting its raw materials through"
"the  Industrial  Park,  Mirijjiwila  and  is  instead  transporting  them  to  its"
"plant 
in  Galle  through  the  port  access  road.  The  raw  material 
is"
"transported in trucks covered by a tarpaulin to minimize dust emission."
"Additionally,  dedusting  hoppers  are  used  for  unloading  raw  material"
"(Clinker) and clinker yards are covered by a tarpaulin and the road to the"
"Clinker yard is routinely sprayed with water to suppress dust generation"
"from 
transporting 
clinker 
through  unpaved 
road.  Due 
to 
these"
"precautions, no any action was filed by anybody or a group against the"
"6th Respondent for environment pollution. Hence, the learned President’s"
"Counsel contended that the only reason filling this Writ Application is the"
"business rivalry."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the 5th Respondent submitted that"
"this Writ Application is a result of a dispute between the Petitioner and"
"the  6th  Respondent  and  the  Petitioner  had  made  several  complaints"
