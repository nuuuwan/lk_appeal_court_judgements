"exact  sequence  of  the  incident  to  the  police  due  to  the  shock  of  seeing  her"
"brother  being  stabbed  and  assaulted  by 
the  assailants.  She  says  very"
"specifically that she has seen the appellant at the scene holding a kriss knife."
"In  cross  examination, 
this  witness  had  said 
that  she  saw 
the  appellant"
"assaulting the deceased but she had not said the same thing to the police, but"
"she  had  said  that,  she  could  not  narrate  the  correct  sequence  of  events"
"because she was suffering from shock."
"The  Doctor  who  conducted  the  post  mortem  report  had  not  been  available  to"
"give evidence, but another doctor who was able to identify his handwriting had"
"given  evidence.  14  external  injuries  had  been  detected.  Injury  number  2  had"
"been identified to be necessarily fatal."
"According to the investigating officers, the appellant as stated above, has been"
"arrested nearly three years after the incident and the Identification parade has"
"been held thereafter, the notes of the Identification parade has been admitted"
"by  both  parties  and  has  been  marked  in  evidence.  At  this  point  the  learned"
"counsel 
for  the  appellant  submitted  that  the  appellant  had  taken  up  the"
"objection at the parade that he had been shown to the witnesses."
"But  the 
learned  SDSG  appearing 
for  the  respondents  submitted  that  the"
"objection pertaining to the accused being shown to the witnesses at the parade"
"is being overused and is becoming very common. He says further that if there"
"is any truth in the statement of the appellant, he could have at least been more"
"specific when referring to the witnesses that he has been shown to."
"This  position  of  the  learned  SDSG  for  the  respondents,  we  hold  is  quite  right"
"because this court also notes that the objection taken up by the appellant that"
"he has been shown to the witnesses at the parade is becoming very common."
"But, at this stage, this court wishes to consider the admissibility of the parade"
"notes  because  it  has  been  held  more  than  two  years  after  the  incident.  The"
"learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted  a  case  decided  by  Sarath  De"
