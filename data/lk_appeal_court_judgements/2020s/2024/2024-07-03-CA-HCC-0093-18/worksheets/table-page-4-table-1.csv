"Counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted  that  the  Trial  Judge  has  misdirected"
"himself  by  not  giving  adequate  weight  to  the  contradictions  marked  in  the"
"evidence of PW1."
"But, 
it 
is  the  opinion  of  this  court  that  when  considering  the  traumatic"
"experience the PW1 had been subjected to, the contradictions referred to in her"
"evidence  is  expected  because  it  has  been  concluded  in  many  of  our  decided"
"cases that a witness cannot be expected to give a uncontradicted narration of"
"events."
"It has been decided in the case of AG VS Potta Naufer and others (2007) 2"
"Sri.L.R 
186 
to 
187, 
“Court 
should 
disregard 
discrepancies 
and"
"contradictions which do not go to the root of the case. The mere presence"
"of contradictions does not have the  mitigating effect against the overall"
"trustworthiness of witnesses”."
"In the case of Oliver Dayananda Kalanasooriya alias Raju v Republic of Sri"
"Lanka,  CA  28/2009  decided  on  13/02/2013  by  Justice  Sisira  Abrew,"
"where  it  has  been  held  that,  “It  is  an  accepted  principle  that  a  criminal"
"case cannot be proved with mathematical accuracy, by evidence given by"
"human beings.”"
"Therefore,  it  is  the  opinion  of  this  court  that  the  learned  trial  judge  has  not"
"misdirected  himself  when  concluding 
that  PW1  has  been  a 
trustworthy"
"witness,  especially  in  view  of  the  fact  that  the  trial  judge  was  mindful  of  the"
"traumatic experience of PW1, the effect of which had been explained by PW1 at"
"page 124 of the brief."
"Thereafter, the prosecution had called PW2, who was the sister of the deceased"
"who apparently had left the house of the deceased just before the incident. The"
"witness had been living in close proximity to the house of the deceased and she"
"says that she had heard her mother (PW3) shouting. Then she had gone to the"
"front  of  the  house  and  she  had  seen  the  deceased  being  assaulted  by  some"
"persons. She had identified the first accused and the appellant(Page 209 of the"
"brief) She had said that the appellant had a kriss knife in his hand. She says"
"that  she  got  to  know  the  name  of  the  appellant  from  the  first  accused.  When"
"she  had  witnessed  the  incident,  she  had  seen  her  brother  fallen  and  the  first"
"accused  stabbing  him.  She  had  further  said  that  the  deceased  had  pleaded"
"with the assailants not to assault him. She says that PW1 and PW3 were at the"
"scene  shouting  out  for  help.  She  further  states  that  she  was  injured  when"
"someone  threw  a  bottle  at  her.  At  the  Identification  parade,  she  had  not"
"identified the appellant but the trial judge had wrongly concluded that she had"
"done so."
