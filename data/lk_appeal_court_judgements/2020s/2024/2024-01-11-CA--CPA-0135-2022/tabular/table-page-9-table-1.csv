"However, it needs to be noted that the learned High Court Judge did not have"
"the benefit of considering the above-mentioned judgement as the Supreme Court"
"judgement was pronounced only on 11-01-2023, whereas, the order pronounced"
"by the learned High Court Judge in relation to the preliminary objection was on"
"16-09-2022."
"Be that as it may, it clearly appears that the learned High Court Judge has been"
"guided by the judgement in Anoma Polwatte (Supra) where it was determined"
"that the institution of proceedings under the Bribery Act or The Declaration of"
"Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975 is a function of the Commission, and"
"such a function shall be exercised by all three members of the Commission."
"Having considered the relevant law in that regard, the learned High Court Judge"
"has  determined  that  investigating  allegations  contained  in  communications"
"made to the Commission should also come within the interpretation of a function"
"in terms of section 3 of the Act, and the indictment should be dismissed as all"
"three Commissioners had not ordered the investigation in relation to the offences"
"mentioned in the indictment."
"Although Anoma Polwatte Case (Supra) was a matter decided on the basis that"
"directing  the  institution  of  proceedings  in  terms  of  the  Bribery  Act  or  The"
"Declaration  of  Assets  and  Liabilities  Law  No.  1  of  1975  is  a  function  of  the"
"Commission and, therefore, the directive of all three Commissioners must be an"
"essential prerequisite to file an action, it appears that the learned High Court"
"Judge  has  gone  further  by  relying  on  the  judgement  of  Anoma  S.  Polwatte"
"(Supra) to interpret the commencement of an investigation in terms of the Act"
"shall  also  be  by  a  directive  of  all  three  Commissioners,  and  any  investigation"
"carried  out  without  such  a  directive  should  have  a  vitiating  effect  on  an"
"indictment filed based on such an investigation."
