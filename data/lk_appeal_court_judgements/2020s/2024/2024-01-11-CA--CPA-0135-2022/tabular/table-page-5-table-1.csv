"At the hearing of this application, the learned Counsel for the petitioner admitted"
"that  all  three  Commissioners  had  not  signed  the  order  to 
investigate  the"
"complaint against the respondent, but only one Commissioner. However, it was"
"her submission that there is no such requirement for all three Commissioners"
"to sign such a directive to commence an investigation."
"It  was  also  her  view  that 
in  any  way,  since  the  Director  General  of  the"
"Commission has filed this indictment based on the directive given to him by the"
"Commission in terms of section 11 of the Act. The High Court has no power to"
"question the validity of the indictment, and it is only before the Supreme Court,"
"in terms of section 24 of the Act, any such challenge can be made."
"The learned Counsel for the petitioner relied on several judgements and orders"
"pronounced  by  this  Court  on  the  above  basis,  and  argued  that  Anoma  S."
"Polwatte  Vs.  The  Director  General  of  the  Commission  to  Investigate"
"Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and Others, SC Writ Application  No."
"1/2011 decided on 26-07-2018, the judgement relied on heavily by the learned"
"High  Court  Judge  to  hold  with  the  arguments  presented  on  behalf  of  the"
"respondent, has no application to the preliminary objection raised and the issues"
"considered by the learned High Court Judge."
"Citing  several  sections  of  the  Act,  it  was  her  view  that  commencing  of  an"
"investigation is a power granted to the Commission in terms of the Act, and such"
"power can be delegated to the officers of the Commission by any member of the"
"Commission sitting together or separately."
"It was her contention that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected when"
"it was determined based on the ratio decidendi of Anoma Polwatte Case (Supra),"
"the  consent  of  all  three  Commissioners  to  file  action,  as  well  as  to  commence"
"investigation, comes within the functions of the Commission in terms of section"
"3  of 
the  Act  and 
for  such  a 
function 
to  be 
legally  binding,  all 
three"
"Commissionersâ€™ directive must be available."
