"This contradictory position of the prosecution witness is not considered by"
"the Learned High Judge in its correct perspective."
"The Apex Court has established precedents in a number of cases stating that"
"the defense would prevail when there is a contradiction that affects the core"
"of the case."
"When a witness gives evidence before the court upon oath, he is expected to"
"tell  the  truth  in  a  court  of  law.  If  the  person  gives  contradictory  evidence"
"opposite to the statement, it is usually called a contradiction. It is the duty"
"of the trail judge to unearth the truth and to come to a conclusion whether"
"an Accused person is guilty or not."
