"In the case of State Rep. by Inspector of Police v. Saravanan AIR 2009 SC"
"152 the Court held that:"
"“The contradictions/omissions must be of such nature which materially"
"affects  the  trial.  Minor  contradictions,  inconsistencies,  embellishments"
"or  improvements  which  do  not  affect  the  core  of  the  prosecution  case"
"should not be made a ground to reject the evidence of the witness in its"
"entirety.”"
