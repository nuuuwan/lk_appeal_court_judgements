"also pointed out by the learned President’s Counsel that although PW-01 marked"

"with this transaction was contrary to that of PW-01 and as a result, there were"
"several inter se and per se inconsistencies in relation to the evidence."
"It  was  also  submitted  that  the  compensation  of  Rs.  4  Million  ordered  by  the"
"learned High Court Judge was contrary to the provisions of Assistance to and"
"Protection of Crime and Witnesses Act No.4 of 2015, as well as the provisions of"
"the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979."
