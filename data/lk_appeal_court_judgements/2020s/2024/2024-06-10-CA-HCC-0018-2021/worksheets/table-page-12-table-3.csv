"his book Offences under the Penal Code of Ceylon at page 493 has commented"
"“The final element which has to be noted in this connection is that there must"
"be a clear causal nexus between the deception practiced by the accused and"
"the complainant being induced to do one of the four things required by the"
"definition  of  the  offence.  In  other  words,  the  complainant  should  have"
"delivered property or done or refrained from some act because he was taken"
"in by the accused’s false representation and not for some other reason. The"
"deception  for  which  the  accused  was  responsible  should  have  been  the"
"effective reason for the complainant’s acting as he did.”"
