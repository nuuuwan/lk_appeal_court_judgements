"find  a  place  to  live.  Any  discrepancies  in  her  evidence  have  to  be  considered"
"under those circumstances unless they are material discrepancies which go on"
"to the core of the issue placed before the Court."
"I  do  not  find  a  reason  to  accept  that  there  is  any  material  inter  se  or  per  se"
"contradictions  among  the  evidence  of  the  main  witnesses  of  this  matter  in"
"relation to the events that took place as a result of the transactions between the"
"PW-01 and the appellant."
"As I have considered before, PW-02 and 03 being close friends and persons who"
"had no reason to give false evidence against the appellant, it is clear that if the"
"intention of the PW-01 was to be a tenant under the appellant as claimed, they"
"should have known that fact from the very outset of the events that led to this"
"dispute."
"I am of the view that the prosecution has approved the relevant ingredients as to"
"the  offence  of  cheating  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  and  I  find  no  reasons  to"
"interfere with the judgment of the learned High Court Judge."
"The other ground of appeal urged by the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel was that"
"the amount of compensation ordered was contrary to the law."
"However, I do not find a basis for the argument as correctly pointed out by the"
"learned  SSC.  In  a  case  of  this  nature,  a  trial  Judge  when  deciding  to  award"
"compensation  can  act  under  the  provisions  of  the  section  17  of  the  Code  of"
"Criminal Procedure Act, or in  a  fit case,  under the provisions of  Assistance to"
"and Protection of Crimes and Witnesses Act No. 4 of 2015. It is correct to say"
"that a High Court Judge when ordering compensation in terms of Assistance to"
"and  Protection  of  Crimes  and  Witnesses  Act  No.  4  of  2015  can  order"
"compensation up to  Rs. 1 Million. However, I do not find a limitation as such"
"when ordering compensation by a High Court Judge in terms of section 17 of the"
"Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The only limitation relates to a Magistrate when"
"ordering compensation in terms of the said section."
