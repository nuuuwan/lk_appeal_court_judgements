"40 years, and that  the  disputed portion was part of the same land. It was also"
"stated  that  the  subject  matter  of  the  partition  action  involved  land  named"
"‘Hettipathira,’ with an extent of 77 acres, 3 roods. According to the Respondent,"
"the  disputed  portion  of  his  land  was  wrongfully included  in  the  corpus  of  the"
"partition action."
"In  my  view,  the  aforementioned  Plan  No.  233,  made  in  the  partition  action,"
"supports the Respondent's contention. It appears that Lot No. 32, the strip of land"
"below the road marked as Lot 35, with an extent of 14.63 perches, is part of a"
"larger lot that was not included in the corpus of the partition action. This position"
"is further supported by the sketch prepared by the Inquiring Officer. Even in the"
"sketch, the disputed portion is shown as part of a larger parcel of land held and"
"possessed by the Respondent."
"As  previously  stated  in  this  judgment,  the  partition  action  was  dismissed."
"Therefore, the inclusion of the disputed portion in the preliminary plan prepared"
"for the partition action holds no  weight  in determining the title. Above all, as"
"held by Sharvananda J. (as His Lordship then was) in the case of Ramalingam v."
"Thangarajah11 (S.C.) ‘Evidence bearing on title can be considered only when"
"the  evidence  as  to  possession  is  clearly  balanced  and  the  presumption  of"
"possession which flows from title may tilt the balance in favour of the owner and"
"help deciding the question of possession’."
"In this instance, there is no balance of evidence regarding possession therefore,"
"evidence on title cannot be considered."
"In any event, evidence related to the partition action cannot be given any weight"
"in the present case, as that action pertained to a different land, which, according"
"to the Appellant's own affidavit, is not the subject land of the instant appeal."
"The Respondent has submitted six letters from the Grama Niladharis who served"
"in the Grama Niladhari Division where the disputed land is situated, to establish"
