"it was held;"
"1.  When  faced with  contradictions  in  a  witnessâ€™s 
testimonial,  the  Court"
"must  bear  in  mind  the  nature  and  significance of  the  contradictions"
"viewed in light of the whole of the evidence given by the witness."
"2.  Two greater significances cannot be attached to  minor discrepancies or"
"contradictions."
"3.  What  is  important  is  whether  the  witness 
is  telling  the  truth  on  the"
"material matters  concerned with the event."
"4.  Where  evidence is  generally reliable, much  importance  should  not  be"
"attached to the minor discrepancies and technical errors."
"5.  The Court  of Appeal will not  lightly disturb  the  finding of a trial  Judge"
"with  regard  to  the  acceptance or  rejection  of  a  witness  unless 
it 
is"
"manifestly wrong."
