"I find that the appellant has been represented by a Counsel when the indictment"
"was  read  over  to  him  and  right  throughout  the  trial.  It  is  amply  clear  that"
"although  the  indictment  was  read  over  to  the  appellant  on  26-10-2016  and"
"thereafter only it has been served on him along with the annexures, the trial has"
"commenced  only  on  11-09-2017,  which  has  provided  enough  space  for  the"
"appellant to study and get ready to face the charge against him. I am of the view"
"that no prejudice or failure of substantial rights has occasioned to him in that"
"regard."
"For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the 2nd, 3rd, and the"
"5th grounds of appeal urged on behalf of the appellant are devoid of merit."
"Having determined the said grounds of appeal, I will now proceed to consider the"
"1st and the 4th grounds of appeal together as they are interrelated."
"It was contended that the learned High Court Judge erred in not considering the"
"infirmities in the prosecution evidence and also  erred by wrongly rejecting the"
"defence evidence."
"It was submitted that admittedly, the mother of the victim child had a paramour"
"and it was against the paramour, the victim child informed her sister that she is"
"being abused. It  was  contended that  the name of the appellant was  something"
"that was  introduced and that was  an infirmity that could have been considered"
"in favour  of the appellant. It  was  also  contended that the period of the offence"
"mentioned in the indictment was  actually related to the offence alleged to have"
"committed by the paramour of the victim’s mother, and when the victim  as well"
"as  her mother gave  evidence in Court, they were very  hesitant to  mention the"
"paramour  or whether the victim’s  mother had an illegitimate relationship with"
"paramour. It  was also  submitted that the evidence also shows the fact  that the"
"mother knew very  well about the sexual abuse committed  on her daughter by"
"her paramour  and she has failed to divulge that fact  to the sister  of the victim"
"when these matters came to light, and she clearly has turned a blind eye which"
"should have been considered in favour of the appellant."
