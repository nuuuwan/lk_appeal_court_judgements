"It  shows  that  the appellant was  not denied of  an  opportunity of  taking up an"
"alibi due to the admission, which has caused no prejudice towards the appellant"
"as to a fair trial."
"This aspect was sufficiently discussed in the case Rex Vs. Dossi 13 Cr. App. R."
"158 where it  was  held that the date specified in an indictment is  not material"
"unless  it  is  an  essential  part  of  the  alleged  offence;  the  defendant  may  be"
"convicted although the Jury finds that the offence was committed on a date other"
"than 
that  specified 
in 
the 
indictment,  amendment  of 
the 
indictment 
is"
"unnecessary although it may be a good practice to do so (provided that there is"
"no prejudice to  the accused)  where it  is  clear on the evidence that  the offence"
"was committed and it was committed on a day other than that specified."
"(Excise 
Inspector) 
Vs. 
V.K 
In 
the 
case 
of  D.R.M   Pandithakoralage"
"Selvanayagam 56 NLR 143, it was held that a mistaken date in the indictment"
"is  not  a  material error,  unless the date is  of  the essence of  the offence or  the"
"accused is prejudiced."
"The  evidence  led  in  this  matter  had  clearly  established  that  the  offence  has"
"occurred  during  the  period mentioned in  the  indictment.  For  the  reasons  as"
"considered above,  I  find  that  the date  not  being specific,  has  not  caused  any"
"prejudice towards  the appellant."
"The 5th ground of appeal urged by the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel was  on the"
"basis  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  proceeded  to  read  over  the"
"indictment to the appellant, even before the indictment was served on him, and"
"has failed to comply with the requirements of section 195 of the Code of Criminal"
"Procedure Act."
"As per the proceedings dated 26-10-2016, it is clear that the indictment has been"
"served on the appellant only after the indictment was  read over  to him and he"
"pleaded not guilty to the charge. This  was  contrary to the procedure laid down"
"in terms of section 195 and 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act."
