"retirement  of  all  categories  of 
staff 
to  58  years  giving  away 
the"
"requirement  of  requesting  extensions  annually  as  per  Circular  No.  SCL"
"2001/10 without repealing such Circular. The 2nd Respondent states that"
"Circular  No.  SCL  2008/043  was  introduced  in  accordance  with  requests"
"made by the Employees Union. However, Circular No. SCL 2009/003 was"
"issued rescinding Circular No. SCL 2008/043 unilaterally by the Petitioner"
"without  obtaining  any  consent  from  the  employees.  Accordingly, 
it  is"
"submitted that neither paragraph 13 of the letter of appointment [the age"
"of  retirement  55  years]  nor  Circular  No.  SCL  2009/003  applies  to  the"
"contracts  of  employment  of  the  employees  which  they  had  with  the"
"Petitioner.  Further,  it  was  the  practice  of  the  Petitioner  Bank  to  grant"
"extensions  for  all  employees  who  sought  extensions  after  the age  of  55"
"years and there was no process of evaluation or discretion involved. It is"
"further  claimed  that  the  1st  Respondent  is  not  bound  by  the  limitations"
"contained 
in 
the Termination  of  Employment  of  Workmen 
(Special"
"Provisions)  Act  [TEWA]  when  an  employee  makes  an  application  to  the"
"Commissioner  of  Labour 
in  respect  of  an  unjustifiable  termination  of"
"services."
"Decision of the 1st Respondent"
"The  Petitioner  in  this  application  seeks  a Writ  of  Certiorari  to  annul  the"
"decision  of  the  1st  Respondent  marked  X6  where  the  Petitioner  was"
"ordered to pay back wages. By said decision, the 1st Respondent has come"
"to  a  finding  that  the  Petitioner  has  terminated  the  services  of  the  2nd"
"Respondent contrary to the provisions of the TEWA. Concerns were raised"
"on the issuance of Circular X3 unilaterally by the Petitioner Bank without"
"obtaining any views on it from its employees. Therefore, it is claimed that"
"Circular X3 is neither an effective agreement nor a confirmatory document"
"to 
that  extent.  Hence, 
it 
is  contended 
that 
the  contractually  valid"
"retirement age is 58 years as reflected in X2. This Court has to consider"
"whether  the  reasons  given  by  the  1st  Respondent 
in  arriving  at  his"
"conclusion  bear  any 
illegality  or 
irrationality  which  comes  under  the"
"purview of writ jurisdiction."
"Circular Pertinent to the Age of Retirement of the Employees of Petitioner"
"Bank"
"As  per  the  letter  of  appointment[X1]  of  the  2nd  Respondent,  the  age  of"
"retirement is 55 years. However, subsequently, the age of retirement was"
"amended or varied by Circulars bearing No. SCL 2001/10 dated 13th March"
