"Nonetheless, the Petitioner categorically denied the above contention, stating that"
"there are no other schools in the feeder area, aside from GHS, Kandy8, that admit"
"10% or more non-Roman Catholic Christian students."
"Since  the  Respondent  argued  that  the  Petitioner  failed  to  establish  residence  and"
"therefore, 
the  Petitioner’s  child  could  not  be  admitted  under 
the  proximity"
"category, it is crucial for this Court to consider the marks awarded to the Petitioner"
"by  the  interview  panel.  The  Petitioner  received  only  15  out  of  50  marks  for"
"proximity. The  interview  panel  purportedly  deducted  5  marks  each  for  the  seven"
"schools  mentioned  in  'P  6',  following  Clause  7.2.4  of  the  Circular.  Clause  7.2.4"
