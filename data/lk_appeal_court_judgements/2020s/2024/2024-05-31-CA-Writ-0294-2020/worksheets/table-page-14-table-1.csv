"Consequently,  it  was  argued  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  that  the"
"Petitioner is entitled to the full 50 marks under the proximity category, increasing"
"the  total  marks  to  sixty-seven,  thus  making  his  child  eligible  for  admission  to"
"GHS, Kandy under the proximity category, subject to the religious quota."
"Based  on  the  analysis  provided  above,  I  concede  that  the  Petitioner  should  have"
"been  awarded 
the  full  marks  of  50  under 
the  proximity 
to  school  category."
"Additionally, as per the previous analysis, they are entitled to 18 marks. Therefore,"
"the  Petitioner  should  have  received  a 
total  of  68  marks,  which  exceeds 
the"
"purported cutoff mark."
"The Respondents have not disclosed the cutoff mark of the 150th child, the last one"
"admitted to the school. The  50% of  this number, which amounts to seventy-five,"
"must be allocated to the proximity category as per Clause 7.1 of Circular. Out of"
"these  seventy-five  seats,  38%  of  them,  which  is  28  seats,  must  be  allocated  to"
"Christian  students.  Within  this  38%,  30%  of  the  seats, 
totalling  22,  must  be"
"allocated  to  non-Methodist  Christians  like  the  Petitioner,  while  8%  should  be"
"allocated to Methodists, amounting to six seats."
"The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent argued that as per Clause"
"6.2.6 
the 
interview  panel  has 
the  authority 
to  make  decisions  regarding 
the"
"admission of students to the school. However, it's important to note that the same"
"Clause specifies that student admissions should be in accordance with the Circular."
"The  discretion  granted 
to 
the 
interview  panel 
is 
intended  for  considering  all"
"relevant  factors  and  arriving  at  suitable  decisions,  within  the  framework  of  the"
"Circular. Therefore, in my opinion, the discretion afforded to the interview  panel"
"under  Clause  6.2.6 
is  not  unrestricted,  but 
rather 
aimed 
at  making 
and"
"implementing  appropriate  decisions  within  the  confines  of  the  Circular.  Thus,"
"from my perspective, the interview panel has overstepped the bounds of discretion"
"afforded to them by the circular, thereby abusing the discretion."
