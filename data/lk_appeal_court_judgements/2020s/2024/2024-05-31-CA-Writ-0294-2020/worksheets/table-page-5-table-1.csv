"enrol the Petitioner’s daughter Udayasooriyan Oneliya Steffani to the school under"
"the category of close proximity and based on Christianity."
"The  1st,  3A  and  5th  Respondents  filed  their  objections  seeking  to  dismiss  the"
"Petition."
"In reply, the Petitioner filed a counter affidavit."
"Factual background"
"The Petitioner submitted an application2 to the ‘GHS, Kandy’ seeking to enrol his"
"child  Udayasooriyan  Oneliya  Steffani  to  Grade  1  of  the  school.  The  Petitioner"
"states  that  he  submitted  all  necessary  documents  to  substantiate  his  claim  to  be"
"qualified under the ‘close proximity’ category and ‘Christianity basis’, in terms of"
"circular No.29/2019 (‘1 R 1’/’P 3(a)’) issued by the Ministry of Education."
"It  was  revealed  during  the  argument  that  the  copy  of  the  circular  annexed  to  the"
"Petition  marked  ‘P  3 A’  was  incomplete,  and  the  parties  subsequently  agreed  to"
"follow  the  circular  submitted  by  the  Respondents  marked  ‘1  R  1’.  However,  the"
"Circular  provided  with  the  objections  was  missing  some  pages.  Therefore,  the"
"Respondents later submitted the full text of the circular along with a motion."
"In response to the Petitioner’s claim that he submitted all necessary documents, the"
"Respondents  argued 
that 
the  documents  did  not  substantiate 
the 
'proximity'"
"required  to  secure  the  necessary  marks  for  that  category. Addressing  the  1st,  3A,"
"and 5A Respondents' contention, the Petitioner stated in his counter affidavit that"
"he  explicitly  mentioned  in  the  first  section  of  his  application  'P  3'  that  he  was"
"seeking  enrolment 
for  his  child  on 
the 
'Christianity  basis,'  under 
the 
'close"
"proximity 
category.'  Specifically, 
the  Petitioner  wrote 
in 
his 
application3,"
"'ක්‍රිස්තියානි  ආගමික  පදනම  (ආස්න්නම  ක්‍රිස්තියානි  ධර්මය  උගන්වන  පාස්ල)'  as  the"
"category."
