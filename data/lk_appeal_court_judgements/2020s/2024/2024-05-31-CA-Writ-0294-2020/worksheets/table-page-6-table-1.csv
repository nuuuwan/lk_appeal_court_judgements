"The Respondents correctly pointed out that Circular No. 29/2019 does not include"
"a  category  under  Clause  3  as  described  by  the  Petitioner.  The  only  applicable"
"category under Clause 3 for the Petitioner’s application is the proximity category4."
"The Petitioner clarified that his application to enrol his child in the nearest school"
"where the Christian religion is taught. The religious basis is not a distinct category"
"under Circular No. 29/2019; rather, it is a consideration within the categories listed"
"in Clause 3."
"It is important to note that while the Circular acknowledges religious basis, there is"
"no  specific  section  in  the  application  for  stating  this  basis,  though  there  are"
"sections for stating the religion of the parents. Therefore, the Petitioner cannot be"
"faulted  for  including  this  basis  in  section  1,  where  the  application  category  is"
"indicated.  Be  that  as  it  may,  GHS,  Kandy  considered  the  Petitioner’s  application"
"under the proximity category and maintained that the child could not be admitted"
"due to a limit of six allocated seats."
"The Petitioner attended the interview for admission to GHS, Kandy, and his child"
"received only 32 out of 100 marks5. Subsequently, the Petitioner appealed to the 1st"
"Respondent, the Principal of GHS, Kandy. After a hearing, it was decided that no"
"change in the marks was necessary, and consequently, the child did not qualify for"
"admission."
"The Petitioner alleges that he was not informed of the decision to reject his appeal."
"However, the  Respondents contended that the decision was communicated to the"
"Petitioner,  as  indicated  by  letter  'P  8'.  'P  8'  is  a  letter  sent  in  response  to  an"
"application made by the Petitioner under the Right to Information Act. It states that"
"the rejection letter was sent on 27th December 2019, via registered mail, but a copy"
"could not be issued as one was not retained. According to Clause 2.6 of Circular"
"No.  29/2019,  applicants  who  were  not  selected  must  be  informed  by  a  letter"
"bearing the signature and seal of the principal. This letter should follow the format"
