"nnual General Meeting"
"T
he Petitioners submitted that on the 13th of July 2023, an Annual General Meeting had"
"been held in which the 2nd Respondent had submitted a new Constitution and alleged that"
"the  said  meeting  was  only  attended  by  80  members.  The  Petitioners  have  failed  to"
"demonstrate to this Court whether they attended the said meeting and also, they have failed"
"to submit the minutes of the said meeting. In our view, especially in the absence of such"
"the Petitioners' contention of presenting and adopting a new Constitution at the  meeting"
"cannot be established."
