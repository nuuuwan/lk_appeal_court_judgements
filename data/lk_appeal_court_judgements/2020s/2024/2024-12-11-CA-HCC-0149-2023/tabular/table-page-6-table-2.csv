"12. The  1st  accused  had  been  imposed  with  sentences  of  6  months  and"
"eighteen months respectively for counts 1 and 2 and both of which have"
"been suspended for 15 years. As opposed to that, the appellant has been"

"contribution to the criminal enterprise may be different. For instance, one"
