"direction to be given to the Director General, it is crystal clear that the act"
"has not provided for one member alone to give such direction.‚Äù"
"The above observations of their Lordships of the Supreme Court, clearly shows"
"that  the  focus  had been  on  the  function  of  instituting  of  proceedings  before  a"
"Court  of  law,  and  that  it  should  be  exercised  by  all  three  members  of  the"
"Commission."
"Since the  Polwatte (Supra) judgement has not provided clear directions as to"
"the commencement of an investigation by the Commission should also by way of"
"a directive by  all three members of the Commission, it becomes necessary for"
"this  Court  to  consider  whether  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  was  correct  in"
"extending the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the Anoma Polwatte"
"(Supra) judgement to dismiss the indictment."
"If  one  takes  the  face  value  of  section  3  of  the  Act,  it  may  be  argued  that,"
"investigate  allegations  and  institution  of  proceedings  are  the  two  functions"
"granted  to  the  Bribery  Commission  and  both  the  functions  shall  need  the"
"approval of all three Commissioners."
"However,  it  is  my  considered  view  that  if  one  goes  through  the  other  relevant"
"sections of the Act, the intention of the legislature in formulating the provisions"
"of  the  Commission  to  Investigate  Allegations  of  Bribery  or  Corruption  Act  had"
"not been that."
