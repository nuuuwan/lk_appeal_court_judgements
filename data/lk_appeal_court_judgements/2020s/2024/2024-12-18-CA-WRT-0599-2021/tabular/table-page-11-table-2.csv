"The preliminary objections raised by the Respondents are as follows:"
"a)  Legal action has not been instituted as provided under the EPF Act"
"against  the  Petitioner.  Therefore,  in  the  event  that  legal  action  is"
"instituted, the Petitioner will have an opportunity, in terms of the"
"provisions set out in the EPF Act, to show cause before the learned"
"Magistrate. Accordingly, the subject matter is premature as there is"
"an alternative remedy available to the Petitioner."
