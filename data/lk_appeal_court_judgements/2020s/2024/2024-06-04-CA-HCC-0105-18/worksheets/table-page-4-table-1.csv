"is violating the procedure to fill the gaps of the prosecution and went on to cite"
"several cases which are as follows,"
"Ponnaiya  vs  Abdul  Cader,  38  NLR  281  it  had  been  held  by  Abrahem  CJ"
"that  the  magistrate  cannot  call  witnesses  after  closure  of  the  case  to  fill"
"in the gaps of the prosecution."
"The  King  vs  Ariyadasa  43  NLR  289  Howard  CJ  had  held  that 
fresh"
"evidence  called  by  the 
judge  except  upon  a  matter  which  arises  ex-"
"improvise is irregular and will vitiate a trial unless such evidence was not"
"calculated to prejudice the accused."
"In  the  instant  matter,  the  GAR  has  been  admitted  by  both  parties  and  it  was"
"only  to  be  marked,  but  the  prosecution  had  failed  to  do  so  and  until  it  had"
"been 
fixed 
for  submissions  of  both  parties  the  prosecution  has  made  an"
"application  to  do  so  and  the  proceedings  show  that  the  defense  had  not"
"objected but that is also questionable because there is an alteration by the trial"
"judge  by  hand  in  the  proceedings  which  is  not  there  in  the  journal  entry  and"
"to 
which 
is 
also 
undated. 
The 
alteration

"විරුද්ඩෙවන්ඩ නනෑ."
"Hence,  whether  the  defense  did  object  or  not  is  questionable  in  view  of  the"
"alteration by the trial judge which is not dated and which is not reflected in the"
"journal entry."
"Hence, although during the trialthe parties had admitted the report it had not"
"been admitted in evidence and the proceedings reveal that the  trial  judge had"
"allowed  it  to  be  called  in  as  evidence  even  after  the  appellant  has  made  his"
"defense,and had the document been marked in evidence the appellants defense"
"may  have  been  different,  because  the  GAR  report  is  not  a  mere  document  in"
"the  case  it  is  the  most  vital  piece  of  evidence  against  the  appellant  in  the"
"instant case."
"Hence,  it  is  the  opinion  of  this  Court  that  the  procedure  followed  by  the  trial"
"judge  is  not  laid  down  in  any  law  book  but  it  has  been  held  in  many  of  the"
"cases  cited  above  that  the  wrong  procedure  cannot  be  adopted  to  fill  in  the"
"gaps of the prosecution because the prosecution has the primary duty to prove"
"the case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt."
"But in the instant matter the prosecution has failed to do its primary duty and"
"the trial judge had stepped in to fill in the lapses of the prosecution."

learned  Counsel  appearing 
for  the  respondents  stated  that  while  not"
