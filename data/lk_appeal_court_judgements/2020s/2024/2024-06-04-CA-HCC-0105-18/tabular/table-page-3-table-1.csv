"The  PNB  officers  had  searched  the  three  houses  habituated  by  the  appellant"
"and in one his sister had been residing but they had not found anything illegal,"
"in the said house."
"Thereafter,  they  had  proceeded  to  the  appellant’s  house  at  Wattala  and  from"
"that  house  they  had  recovered  some  jewelry  and  a  large  amount  of  money"
"which  had  been 
later  handed  over  to  the  sister  of  the  appellant  on  the"
"instructions  of  the  appellant  which  the 
learned  Counsel 
for  the  appellant"
"submitted to be very improbable."
"Upon perusing the evidence led at the trial this Court finds nothing unusual in"
"handing over the money to the  appellant’s sister which had been done on the"
"request of the appellant."
"Secondly  the  PNB  officers  waiting  in  the  vehicle  for  several  hours  until  the"
"appellant arrived when the PNB office was very nearby is also nothing unusual"
"because had they gone back,they run the risk of missing the appellant."
"PW1  had  been  corroborated  by  PW3  who  had  assisted  him  and  all 
the"
"witnesses  of  the  raid  had  been  very  lengthily  cross-examined  but  they  had"
"stood the test of cross examination well."
"Hence this Court fails to see any improbability in the story of the prosecution."
"The next ground of appeal raised by the learned Counsel for the appellant was"
"that the learned trial judge had adopted wrong procedure to fill the gaps of the"
"prosecution."
"This Court observes that the Government  Analyst report in the case has been"
"admitted by both parties on the 30th August 2017 and the report was only to be"
"marked and produced as evidence through the Interpreter Mudliyar."
"The trial judge had called for the defense on the 25th of September 2017 and on"
"the 31st October 2017 the appellant has made a dock statement  and the case"
"for the prosecution and the defense had been closed and it had been  fixed for"
"submissions of both parties for the 27th of November 2017 but on that due to a"
"practical  difficulty  the  submissions  had  been  refixed  for  the  14th  of  December"
"2017."
"On the 14th December 2017 also the matter has gone down to the 13thof March"
"2018 and again the Journal entry and the proceedings both indicate that it is"
"due for the submissions of both sides, but the  trial  judge had minuted in the"
"journal  entry  that  the  Government  Analyst  Report  has  been  marked  and  the"
"trial judge had proceeded to make an order in the proceedings that it is only to"
"mark  the  GAR  which  has  already  been admitted.  Thereafter  the  mudliyar  has"
"been called to mark the GAR which the learned Counsel for the appellant said"
