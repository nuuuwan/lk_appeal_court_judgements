"must be noted that in the case decided by L.H. De Alwis J. the inspection was"
"done in the presence of the petitioner’s husband. In the present case although a"
"testing was done it was not carried out with notice to the petitioner."
"L.H.  De.  Alwis  J.  also  considered  the  urgency  of  the  matter  where  his"
"lordship said at page 616 “In the present case the supply of adequate electrical"
"power to the Victoria Project is of the utmost urgency for the implementation of"
"the  Accelerated  Mahaweli  Programme.  As 
the  description  of 
this  scheme"
"connotes it is a matter of great public urgency. There cannot be any delay. The"
"delay in taking the electricity transmission lines across the petitioner's land not"
"only impedes the progress of this scheme but also involves the Government in"
"very heavy expenditure of lakhs of rupees on the purchase of diesel to operate"
"the generators that are now used to provide the additional power to the Victoria"
"Project.  The  affidavit  of  the  Senior  Central  Engineer  attached  to  the  Ceylon"
"Electricity Board, which is filed of record, bears this out.”"
"Therefore,  the  Court  of  Appeal  considered  what  it  called  “a  great  public"
"urgency.”  As  Lord  Diplock  said  in  Kodeeswaran  vs.  the  Attorney  General"
"(1969)  with  regard  to  the  Proclamation  of  1799  A.D,  that  the  language  used"
"must  be  understood  in  the  circumstances  of  the  particular  era,  the  term"
"“Great  public  urgency”  should  also  be  understood  in  the  circumstances  that"
"prevailed  in  this  country  in  1982  where  the  then  Government  took  steps  to"
"complete a project in an accelerated way."
"The respondent in the present case also says that there was an urgency in"
"this  matter 
too, 
to  prevent 
the 
“contaminated” 
teas 
from 
reaching 
the"
"international  market.  However  according  to  the  narration  of 
facts  by  the"
"respondents themselves, the samples of teas were obtained on 03.06.2020, the"
"report has come on  26.06.2020, and the Petitioner was suspended with effect"
"from  30.06.2020.  What  happened  from  26.06.2020  to  30.06.2020  is  not"
"explained, while the more significant question is that if there had been such an"
"emergency of stopping the “contaminated” teas from reaching the international"
