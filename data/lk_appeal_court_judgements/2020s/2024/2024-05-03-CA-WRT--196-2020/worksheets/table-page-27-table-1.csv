"Therefore, Denning L. J. has decided that the suspension in question"
"in  that  case  was  a  punishment.  Hence  what  was  said  in  reference  to"
"suspensions that were not punishments was in obiter."
"Geoffrey Lane J., went even further and said,"
"“The  National  Executive  Committee,  acting  on  legal  advice,  decided  in"
"effect that they would not suspend and there is no evidence of any danger"
"or of any suspicion that that decision may be reversed. Since that is so,"
"there is no need to decide whether there was any power to suspend the"
"plaintiffs nor to decide the applicability or otherwise of the rules of natural"
"justice.” (page 26 of the judgment)"
"Hence that case can be even categorized under a judgment in which"
"the question of the applicability of the rules of natural justice never arose."
"Therefore, whereas Denning L. J., said the suspension in question was"
"a  punishment  Geoffery  Lane  J.,  said  the  applicability  of  rules  of  natural"
"justice  does  not  arise  hence  what  the  respondent’s  cite  as  favourable  to"
"them was clearly said in obiter."
"Furthermore  Denning  L.J.,  commencing  his  speech,  in  his  customary"
"short sentences of precise meaning said,  “This is  an urgent case. So we must"
"proceed 
to  give 
judgment  at  once”. 
(page  02  of 
the 
judgment)  Therefore"
"admittedly, to observe with respect, the questions have not been considered in"
"great depth."
"Denning L.J., had referred to John vs. Rees (1968) in the aforesaid case."
"It is pertinent to note what Megarry J., said in that case. One of the questions"
"considered in that case was the applicability of the rule, audi alteram partem."
"Although 
it  was  considered 
in  regard  to  “expulsion”  and  “ipso  facto"
"cessation  of  membership”,  it  applies  in  equal  force  to  the  difference"
"between “suspension” and “cancellation” in the present case."
"It was said,"
