"respectively."
"“It  is  only  too  easy  to  frame  a  precise  set  of  rules  which  may  appear"
"impeccable on paper and which may yet unduly hamper, lengthen and, indeed,"
"perhaps even frustrate (see per Lord Reid in Wiseman vs. Borneman at 710) the"
"activities of those engaged in investigating or otherwise dealing with matters that"
"fall within their proper sphere. In each case careful regard must be had to the"
"scope of the proceedings, the source of its jurisdiction (statutory in the present"
"case), the way in which it normally falls to be conducted and its objective”."
"The  judgment  of  In  re  Pergamon  Press  Ltd.,  1970,  [Referred  to  in"
"paragraph  76  of  the  aforesaid  Written  Submissions  of  the  Respondent]"
"comprises of three speeches made by Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls,"
"Lord Sachs and Lord Buckley. The facts of the case, in brief as narrated in the"
"speech of Lord Sachs were,"
"“This was a company in which the capital as valued on the London Stock"
"Exchange ran into millions of pounds. The take over or merger bid involved"
"25  million  pounds.  The  dealings  on  the  London  Stock  Exchange  was"
"suspended and, what is more, we were informed in this Court that they"
"remain suspended. That is a matter that must be of grave importance to a"
"large number of individual shareholders in this company. Accordingly, the"
"situation  was  one  which  called  for  as  much  speed  as  practicable  in  the"
"investigation”."
"The  American  company  Leasco  made  a 
takeover  bid,  which 
they"
"subsequently  withdrew.  The  price  of 
the  shares  slumped.  Dealings  were"
"suspended.  The Board of  Trade ordered  an investigation.  Two inspectors  were"
"appointed. The tussle between the Inspectors and the Directors of The Pergamon"
"Press was described by Lord Denning, as reproduced below,"
