"","Counsel referred to the judgment of Lord Denning M. R. in Lewis v. Heffer"
"","(3) in which he used the term holding operation after quoting Megarry J."
"","in  John  v.  Rees  (4).  It  arose  in  this  manner.  In  the  course  of  the"
"","submissions in John v. Rees it was the contention of the counsel for"
"","the  plaintiff  that  the  rules  of  natural  justice  apply  not  only  to"
"","expulsion or dismissal, but also to suspension from office, and among"
"","the  cases  cited  by  him  were  Burn  v.  National  Amalgamated  Labourers'"
"","Union of Great Britain and Ireland (5), Megarry J. said at page 305: ""Burn's"
"","case (68) concerned a trade union. A rule required the executive committee"
"","of the union to ""take every means to secure the observance of the Union's"
"","rules"", and authorised it to ""suspend, expel and prosecute members"" and"
"","to  ""remove  any  incompetent  or  insubordinate  officer"".  The  committee"
"","passed a resolution removing the plaintiff from any office held by him, and"
"","preventing him from holding any delegation on behalf of the union for five"
"","years. The plaintiff had been treasurer of his branch, and was chairman"
"","of it at the date of the resolution. The complaint against him related solely"
"","to his conduct as treasurer; and the resolution was passed without hearing"
"","the plaintiff or giving him any opportunity of explaining. P. G. Lawrence,"
"","J., construed the rules strictly, and held that the language of the rule did"
"","not authorise the resolution that was passed. He went on to consider the"
"","position if he were wrong in thus construing the rules, and said: ""I have"
"","no hesitation in holding that the power to suspend or expel a member for"
"acting  contrary 
to 
the  rules","is  one  of  a  quasi-judicial  nature.""  He"
"","accordingly  held  the  resolution  bad  because  the  plaintiff  had  not  been"
"","given an opportunity of being heard in his defence. In relation to the rule"
"","of  natural  justice,  P.  O.  Lawrence,  J.,  thus  made  no  distinction"
"","between  suspension  and  expulsion.  I  would  respectfully  concur:  in"
"","essence suspension is merely expulsion pro tanto. Each is penal, and"
"","each  deprives  the  member  concerned  of  the  enjoyment  of  his  rights  of"
"","membership or office. Accordingly, in my judgment the rules of natural"
