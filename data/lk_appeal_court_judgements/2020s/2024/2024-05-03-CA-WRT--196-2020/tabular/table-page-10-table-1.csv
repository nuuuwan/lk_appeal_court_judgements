"In the aforesaid case the question was laying of an electricity transmission"
"line across two lands belonging to the petitioner. Section 15(2) of the Electricity"
"Act requires that before a licensee enters on any land he shall give 30 days-notice"
"stating  as  fully  and  accurately  as  possible  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  acts"
"intended to be done where the notice should be substantially in the prescribed"
"form. The petitioner alleged that notice P2 dated 06.04.1982 did not set out the"
"proposed  route  for  installation  of  electric  line  over  the  lands  of  the  petitioner."
"However, P2 disclosed as the petitioner admitted in his affidavit, that the notice"
"did state that the second respondent intended to survey the lands, lop off the"
"branches of the trees, mark the trees standing there or, cut down the trees, dig"
"trenches, erect posts, affix wires and perform other  acts.  The Court of Appeal"
"decided  that  the  first  respondent  could  not  possibly,  at  that  stage,  give  any"
"indication as to the route along which the transmission lines should be taken"
"over the lands before he inspected and surveyed the land and hence notice P2"
"was a sufficient compliance with section 15 (2)."
