"","justice  prima  facie  apply  to  any process  of  suspension  in  the  same"
"","way that they apply to expulsion. Lord Denning in Lewis v. Heffer (5),"
"","having quoted the last few lines above said: ""Those words apply, no doubt,"
"","to suspensions which are inflicted by way of punishment, as for instance"
"","when a member of the Bar is suspended from practice for six months, or"
"","when  a  solicitor  is  suspended  from  practice.  But  they  do  not  apply  to"
"","suspensions which are made, as a holding operation, pending enquires."
"","Very often irregularities are disclosed in a government department or in a"
"","business  house;  and  a  man  may  be  suspended  on  full  pay  pending"
"","inquiries. Suspicion may rest on him; and so he is suspended until he is"
"","cleared  of  it.  No  one,  so  far  as  I  know,  has  ever  questioned  such  a"
"","suspension  on  the  ground  that  it  could  not  be  done  unless  he  is  given"
"","notice of the charge and an opportunity of defending himself, and so forth."
"","The  suspension 
in  such  a  case 
is  merely  done  by  way  of  good"
"","administration. A situation has arisen in which something must be done"
"","at  once.  The  work  of  the  department  of  the  office  is  being  affected  by"
"","rumours and suspicions. The others will not trust the man. In order to get"
"","back  to  proper  work,  the  man  is  suspended.  At  that  stage  the  rules  of"
"","natural justice do not apply"": See Furnell v. Whangarei High Schools Board"
"","(6). Geoffrey Lane LJ. in the course of the same judgment at page 360 said;"
"","""So far as the rules of natural justice are concerned, it is suggested that"
"","before the NEC suspended the committees and officers they should have"
"","been heard, and the fact that they were not heard was a breach of the rules"
"","of natural justice sufficient to invalidate the suspension. It seems to me"
"","that  this  suspension  was  an  administrative  action  by  which  by  its  very"
"","nature had to be taken immediately. It was impossible for the NEC at that"
"","stage, and I emphasise those words 'at that stage', to hear both sides. In"
"","most  types  of  investigation  there  is  in  the  early  stages  a  point  at  which"
"","action of some sort must be taken and must be taken firmly in order to set"
"","the wheels of investigation in motion. Natural justice will seldom if ever at"
