"on him: and so, he is suspended until he is cleared of it. No one, so far as"
"I know, has ever questioned such a suspension on the ground that it could"
"not be done unless he is given notice of the charge and an opportunity of"
"defending himself, and so forth. The suspension in such a case is merely"
"done  by  way  of  good  administration.  A  situation  has  arisen  in  which"
"something must be done at once. The work of the department or the office"
"is being affected by roumers and suspicions. The others will not trust the"
"man. In order to get back to proper work, the man is suspended. At that"
"stage the rules of natural justice do not apply, see Furnell’s case (1973)"
"Appeal Cases 660.” (page 17 of the judgment)"
