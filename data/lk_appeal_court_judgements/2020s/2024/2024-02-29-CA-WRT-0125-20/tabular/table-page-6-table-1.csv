"marked as R8, R9 and C 1 and for Lot 9 as evidenced by the documents marked as R20,"
"R22 and C 3 still, the Petitioner disagreed with the compensation offered to those Lots"
"on the basis that the compensation offered is far below the market value. The learned"
"DSG further submitted to the Court that the name reflected in the Gazette Notifications"
"as the Claimant does not create a legal barrier to the actual owner to claim and obtain"
"compensation and a decision has already been taken to pay the compensation for the"
"entirety of the land that had been acquired."
"Analysis"
"The dispute between the parties in the instant Application regarding Lot 4 and Lot 9 of"
"the land known as “Iriyagahapillewa” is twofold;"
"(a) the names of the land mentioned in the Gazette Notifications are incorrect and (b)"
"the amount decided as compensation is below the market value."
"The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argued that the reason that the name"
"of the land was incorrectly mentioned in the Gazette Notifications marked as P2A and"
"P3A, the Petitioner did not receive due compensation for the land acquired. However,"
"the learned DSG appearing for the Respondent submitted that the 2nd Respondent had"
"held an inquiry into the claims for compensation under Section 9 of the Act and the"
"Petitioner had participated in the inquiry and identified as the owner of Lots 4 and 9."
