"In Ranjeet Kumar Ram v. State of Bihar [2015] SCC Online SC 500 the"
"court held that:"
"“Evidence of the child witness and its credibility would depend upon the"
"circumstances of each case. Only precaution which the court has to bear"
"in  mind  while  assessing  the  evidence  of  a  child  witness  is  that  the"
"witness must be a reliable one”."
"Learned High Court Judge in his judgment considered the age of PW1 and"
"discussed  how  he  is  going  to  analyse  his  evidence  in  his  judgment.  The"
"relevant portion is re-produced below:"
"Page 240 of the brief."

"In this case, PW1 is an eye witness. Hence, admissibility of the evidence of"
"an eye witness needs to be discussed very clearly."
"Eyewitness  testimony 
is  one  of  the  most 
important  kinds  of  criminal"
"evidence. In criminal cases, the judges regularly face the difficult but crucial"
"task of evaluating eyewitness’s testimony. This sometimes means checking"
"whether  the  witness’s  story  fits  with  other  established  facts  of  the  case."
"However, the veracity of such a story cannot always be verified or falsified"
"directly.  In  such  cases,  judges  will  have  to  look  at  whether  the  statement"
"comes from a reliable source."
