"CA/HCC/0002/20"
"As  this  case  solely  relies  on  the  evidence  of  the  eye  witness  and  other"
"circumstantial evidence, I conclude that the prosecution had succeeded in"
"adducing  highly  incriminating  evidence  against  the  Appellant  and  thereby"
"established a strong prima-facie case against him. As such we conclude that"
"this is not an appropriate case in which to interfere with the findings of the"
"Learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Puttalam  dated  05/02/2020.  Hence,  we"
"dismiss the Appeal."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Puttalam along with the original case record."
