"Right to Information request made by her. As per the said document the nomination had"
"been  made  on  28.05.2018.  It  is  the  contention  of  the  Petitioner  that  she  was  legally"
"married to the deceased and that the nomination was made on the same basis  of  her"
"being his legal wife."
"However, the Respondents contend that the Petitioner was never legally married to the"
"deceased  as  the  marriage  contracted  has  no  legal  validity.  Hence  though  there  is  a"
"nomination the said nomination lacks legality. The attention of the Court was drawn to"
"the document marked as P 11, the marriage certificate of the Petitioner to the deceased."
"The said marriage had been contracted on 5.12.2016. The Respondents contended that"
"the deceased had had a marriage prior to the purported marriage to the Petitioner. From"
"the said marriage the deceased had a child who is the 5th Respondent. Subsequently, the"
"deceased  had  instituted  divorce  proceedings  and  the  divorce  had  been  granted.  The"
"Respondentsâ€™  contention  is  that  the  decree  nisi  has  been  made  absolute  on  a  day"
"subsequent  to  the  date  of  the  second  marriage.  Hence,  the  argument  that  the  second"
"marriage  is  illegal. As  per  page  36  of  P5,  the  order  nisi  has  been  made  absolute  on"
"13.02.2017.  However, the Petitioner had married the deceased on 5.12.2016, which is"
"prior to the decree nisi being made absolute. At this stage, the learned Counsel appearing"
"for the Petitioner too conceded that the second marriage had been contracted before the"
"decree nisi had been made absolute."
