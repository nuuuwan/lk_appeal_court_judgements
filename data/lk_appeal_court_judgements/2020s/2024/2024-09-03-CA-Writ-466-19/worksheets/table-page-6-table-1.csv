"Constitutional Ouster in terms of Article 61A of the Constitution"
"The  Respondents  have  taken  up  the  stance  that  the  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  in"
"hearing  this  matter 
is  ousted  by  Article  61A  of  the  Constitution  by  which  the"
"decisions of the Public Service Commission are immune to writ jurisdiction of this"
"Court. The Petitioner seeks a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the NPC(P13)"
"and a Writ of Mandamus against the Inspector General of Police and the members"
"of the NPC. However, after the institution of the instant application, by virtue of the"
"20th Amendment to the Constitution, power to consider all matters pertaining to the"
"appointment,  promotion, 
transfer,  disciplinary  control  and  dismissal  of  Police"
"Officers  and  appeals  by  Police  Officers  pending  before 
the  National  Police"
"Commission had been transferred to the Public Service Commission. Accordingly, the"
"caption of this application had been amended by substituting the then members of"
"the  Public  Service  Commission  as  10th  to  17th  Respondents 
in  place  of  NPC."
"Nevertheless, after the effect of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution such power"
"to consider the matters pertaining to appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary"
"control and dismissal of police officers other than the Inspector-General of Police,"
"have been revested with the NPC. Hence the substitution of members of the Public"
"Service Commission has no effect in this application. Further, it is observed that the"
"Petitioner is not seeking any relief against the Public Service Commission or its order."
