"the alleged misconduct that had been committed on 26.04.2012. The Director"
"of the Police Training School had directed ASP/ Y.L. Leelawansa to conduct a"
"Preliminary Investigation. ASP/ Y.L. Leelawansa in any case was a Head of the"
"Department of the appellant. Therefore, he was legally entitled to conduct the"
"said Preliminary Investigation in terms of Section 6.2 of Chapter XLVIII of the"
"Establishment Code.”"
"It  appears  that  the  AAT  was  of  the  view  that  direction  has  been  given  to  the"
"ASP/Leelawansa  to  conduct  the  Preliminary  Investigation  by  the  Director  of  the"
"Police Training College by order of the DIG Training Range. Such circumstances also"
"support  the  stand  of  the  Petitioner  that  there  was  no  direction  from  the  IGP  to"
"appoint the said ASP/Leelawansa as a Preliminary Investigating Officer."
"Further, a definition is given for the “Head of Department” in Clause 1:1:7 in Chapter"
"XLVIII of Volume ii of the Establishment Code in the following manner."
"1:1:7 “Heads of Departments” means the Heads of  Departments and"
"other officers listed in Appendix I of Volume I of the Establishments Code"
"and  other  officers  appointed  from  time  to  time  by  the  Cabinet  of"
"Ministers as Heads of Departments."
"Appendix I of Volume I of the Establishments Code stipulates that Inspector General"
"of Police  is the Head of the Police Department. Therefore, it is apparent that the"
"ASP/Leelawansa was not vested with the authority to hold the preliminary inquiry by"
"the Head of Department of the Petitioner. Accordingly, the conclusion of the  AAT"
"that, the ASP/ Y.L. Leelawansa in case of the matters pertaining to instant application,"
"was a Head of the Department of the Petitioner and therefore, he was legally entitled"
"to conduct the said Preliminary Investigation in terms of Section 6.2 of Chapter XLVIII"
"of the Establishment Code is a complete misinterpretation of law. Accordingly, the"
"order of the AAT cannot be sustained in law."
"The Petitioner has taken up several other grounds, that may be considered by this"
"Court, such as irregularities and inconsistencies in the evidence led and produced by"
"the Respondents against the Petitioner at the Preliminary and the Formal Inquiries."
"In view of the above my findings, I am of the view that consideration of such matters"
"does not arise in the above context."
