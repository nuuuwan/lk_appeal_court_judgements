"officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection"
"of the evidence as a whole.‚Äù"
"The fact that the appellants as well as the 1st accused were well known to the"
"victim was an undisputed fact. The evidence of PW-01 led at the trial has clearly"
"established the fact that the appellants were instrumental in calling the PW-01"
"out from his home. It was the 2nd appellant who has attacked the victim first."
"Thereafter, the 1st accused indicted had inflicted cut injuries on him. According"
"to the uncontradicted evidence of PW-01, when he fell on the ground as a result,"
"the 1st appellant had attacked him with a club."
"The fact that the JMO has observed only 2 cut injuries does not mean that the"
"victim was not attacked by the appellants in the manner stated by him in his"
"evidence. According to PW-01, the 1st attack had been to his left eye. When the"
"doctor examined the victim, he has observed injuries on both eyes of PW-01 as"
"the cut injury too had been towards both his eyes. The doctor may not have been"
"in a position to categorize the injuries to the eyes as separate injuries. It is quite"
"possible that although PW-01 had been assaulted with a club, it may not have"
"caused injuries to him."
"The history given by the patient to the doctor is very much consistent with the"
"evidence of PW-01."
