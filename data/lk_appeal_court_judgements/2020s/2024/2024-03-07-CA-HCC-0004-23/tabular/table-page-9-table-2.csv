"E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, in his book The Law of Evidence Volume I at page"
"224 states thus;"
"“But even in criminal cases, it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove"
"a motive or the adequacy of the motive, if any, in order to establish the"
"charge. The motive which induces a man to do a particular act is known"
"to him and him alone. Therefore, the prosecution is not bound to prove a"
"motive for the offence, though it can suggest a motive, and when it does"
"so, the judge or jury can examine it. Where there is clear evidence that a"
"person has committed an offence, it is immaterial that no motive has been"
"proved,  or  that  the  evidence  of  motive  in  not  clear.”  (See-  Emperor  Vs."
"Balaram Das 49 Cal. 358)."
"Therefore,  it  is  not  necessary  to  prove  the  motive  at  all.  A  conviction  is"
"possible without any motive being disclosed."
