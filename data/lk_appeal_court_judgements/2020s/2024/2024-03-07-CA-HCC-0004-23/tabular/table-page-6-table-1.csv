"","Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal"
"As the  grounds of appeal  urged by the  learned Counsel for  the appellants are",""
"interrelated, I will now consider all the grounds of appeal together, drawing my",""
"attention to the submissions made in that regard by the learned Counsel for the",""
"appellants  as  well  as  the","learned  Senior  State  Counsel  on  behalf  of  the"
"respondent, namely, the Attorney General.",""
"In his submissions before the Court, the learned Counsel for the appellants relied",""
"mainly on the MLR marked P-02 to argue that the injured have received only two",""
"cut injuries contrary to the claim by him in his evidence that he was attacked by",""
"all three accused mentioned in the indictment.",""
"It was his argument that it was only the 1st accused indicted, who pleaded guilty",""
"to the charge at the very outset of the trial, caused the  injuries and the medical",""
"evidence does not provide any evidence against the appellants.",""
"He was of the view that given the contradictory nature of the evidence of PW-01",""
"and the medical evidence, the conviction against the appellants was bad in law,",""
"and moved for the acquittal of the appellants on that basis.",""
"The learned Senior State Counsel narrating the facts that led to the incident as",""
"elicited  by  way  of  evidence,  pointed  out  the  seriousness  of  the  cut  injuries",""
"inflicted on the victim. It was her position that although the JMO has observed",""
"cut injuries,  which can be attributed to the 1st  accused indicted, the evidence",""
"clearly provides that the appellants too had attacked the victim.",""
"She pointed out to the uncontradicted evidence of PW-01, that the 2nd appellant",""
"attacked him with a hand clip and the 1st appellantâ€™s action after he fell on the",""
"ground, where he has assaulted him with a club.",""
"It was her view that since the learned High Court Judge has well considered the",""
"evidence  and  the  relevant  law  in  his  judgement  and  has  given  a  reasonable",""
"sentence, the appeal should stand  dismissed, as there is no basis to interfere",""
"with the conviction and the sentence.",""
