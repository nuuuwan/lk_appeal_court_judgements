"After leading the evidence of police witnesses who had conduced investigations"
"into  the  matter,  the  prosecution  has  closed  its  case.  Accordingly,  the  learned"
"High Court Judge has decided to call for a defence of the appellant."
"The appellant has decided to make a dock statement. He has admitted that the"
"deceased child was given to him and his wife to be looked after, and has claimed"
"that since they could not afford to look after her, he took the child on the day of"
"the incident in order to hand over the child to her grandmother. Since he could"
"not handover as no one was at the house of the grandmother, he has claimed"
"that  he  returned  to  Nochchiyaagama  along  with  the  child,  and  while  walking"
"towards his house, the child ran in front of him on the bank of the bridge they"
"were passing."
"Although he shouted at her not to run and also assaulted her with a small stick,"
"she has continued to run and  had fallen  off the bank and rolled over. He has"
"claimed that when he ran towards her to check, but the child was unconscious,"
"and  believing  that  she  has  suffered  a  blockage  of  phlegm,  he  held  her  cheeks"
"tight,  opened  her  mouth  and  attempted  to  remove  the  phlegm,  but  failed."
"Thereafter, he has claimed that he took the child to his house and after obtaining"
"some money, brought the child to the hospital. He has claimed innocence and"
"stated that he did not commit a crime."
