"injury that had caused the death. The injury number 02 and 03 had also been"
"contusions near the right-side ear and the eye of the child. The 4th, 5th and 6th"
"injuries identified had been 27 finger nail abrasions on the cheeks and the chin"
"of  the  child.  He  has  opined  that  such  fingernail  abrasions  can  occur  when"
"someone attempts to cover the face of the child and when the child resists such"
"attempts. The injury number 07 was also a group of abrasions over the right side"
"of the chest just below the armpit. The injury number 08 had been a group of"
"similar injuries on the left side of the chest just below the left armpit. The JMO"
"has  opined  that  such  injuries  can  occur  when  someone  holds  a  child  of  this"
"tender age from the two armpits and violently shakes or violently lifts such  child."
"The injury number 09, 10 and 11 has been scars of an injury that had occurred"
"previously, and the JMO has described them as burn injuries. The injury number"
"12 and 13 had been described as scars observed on the two knee joints, which"
"may be a result of a fall."
"The internal injury number 14 has been identified as a tear of the upper lip of"
"the child. The JMO has opined that this kind of injury cannot occur as a result"
"of a fall without causing corresponding injuries to the face, and has opined that"
"this injury has been caused by an intentional assault. The injury number 15 was"
"a subdural haemorrhage to the head, which has caused internal bleeding. The"
"JMO has opined that such an injury can occur due to an  assault or applying"
"force onto the head, and he has also opined that such an injury can happen as"
"a result of a motor traffic accident or even due to a fall or an accident."
"The injury number 16 has also been an internal injury caused to the frontal lobe"
"of the brain. The JMO has opined that the said injury was an injury caused as a"
"result of the injury number 01 observed by him."
"Giving evidence, the JMO has clearly opined that the injuries which caused the"
"death  of  the  child  cannot  occur  as  a  result  of  a  fall,  and  has  given  a  detailed"
"reasoning for his opinion."
