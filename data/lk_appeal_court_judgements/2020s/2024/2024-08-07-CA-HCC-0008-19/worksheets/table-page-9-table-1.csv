"I am also unable to agree with the contention that the learned High Court Judge"
"has compartmentalized the evidence. On the contrary, it is quite apparent that"
"the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  the  totality  of  the  evidence  in"
"coming to his findings. The learned High Court Judge has considered the fact"
"that the deceased was under the care of the appellant, her living conditions while"
"being taken care, and the evidence of fellow villagers in that regard. He has well"
"considered the evidence of the prosecution as well as the position taken up by"
"the appellant in his defence to consider whether a reasonable doubt has been"
"created or a reasonable explanation has been provided against the evidence led"
"before the trial Court."
"I do not find a basis to consider that the learned High Court Judge has heavily"
"relied on the expert evidence to convict the appellant."
"No doubt that the learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence of the"
"JMO in detail, it is clear that the JMO’s evidence has only been considered as a"
"part of the circumstantial evidence available before the Court."
"In the dock statement, the position taken up by the appellant had been to the"
"effect  that  the  child  while  running  away  from  him,  fell  over  a  bank,  and  was"
"unconscious when he reached her. The JMO has found a contusion on the child’s"
"forhead  which  has  caused  her  death.  It  is  clear  from  the  version  of  events  as"
"narrated  by  the  appellant  in  his  dock  statement,  he  has  made  an  attempt  to"
"explain the injury and also the nail marks found on the child’s face and also near"
"her armpits to show that he made an attempt to revive her. The  learned High"
"Court Judge has considered the medical evidence in that context, and not only"
"relying on such evidence to convict the appellant."
"It appears that since the explanation by the appellant was to suggest that the"
"death of the child was a result of an accident, the learned High Court Judge has"
"considered  it  as  an  attempt  by  the  appellant  to  show  that  the  incident  comes"
"within the general exceptions as stated in the Penal Code. It has been determined"
