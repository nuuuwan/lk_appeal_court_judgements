"Further, an eyewitness’s testimony is probably the most persuasive form of"
"evidence  presented  in  court,  but  in  many  cases,  its  accuracy  is  dubious."
"There  is  also  precedent  that  erroneous  eyewitness  evidence  can  lead  to"
"wrongful convictions sending people to prison for years or decades, even to"
"death row, for crimes they did not commit."
"When considering the evidence of an eye witness, the Court should look at"
"the demeanour of the witness, the inherent probability of the account, any"
"internal inconsistencies in the account, whether the account is consistent"
"with previous statements by the witness, whether the witness has any bias"
"against the accused or any family or group to which the accused belongs,"
"whether the evidence at the crime scene supports the account, and whether"
"the  witness’s  testimony  is  supported  by  the  testimony  of  other  witnesses."
"These factors are very important as the burden of proof is on the prosecution"
"in all criminal cases."
