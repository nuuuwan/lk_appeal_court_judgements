"Accordingly,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  succeeding  Judge  can"
"proceed with the case adopting the evidence taken by his predecessor"
"even  without  recording  the  adoption  of  evidence  when  there  is  no"
"demand by an accused person to resummon and rehear the witnesses."
"However, it is to be noted that it is advisable to record the consent of"
"the parties whenever the evidence is adopted and then proceed before"
"the succeeding Judge."
