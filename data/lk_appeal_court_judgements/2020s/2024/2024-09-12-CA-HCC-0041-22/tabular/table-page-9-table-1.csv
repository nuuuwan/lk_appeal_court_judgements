"wrote  the  Judgment  and  dismissed  the  action.  According  to  the  said"
"Supreme Court decision, one of the options available to the succeeding"
"Judge  is  to  act  on  the  evidence  already  recorded  by  his  predecessor."
"Therefore, even if no evidence has been led before the Judge who writes"
"the Judgment, the succeeding Judge can act on the evidence already"
"recorded by his predecessor. What the Supreme Court emphasized in"
"the said Judgment is that it is obligatory on the succeeding Judge to"
"have the case called in the open Court and notify the parties that he is"
"required  to  deliver  the  Judgment.  In  the  aforesaid  case  of  Central"
"Finance Company PLC V. Chandrasekera, the learned Judge who heard"
"the evidence in the Commercial High Court was elevated to the Court"
"of Appeal. However, even if the Judge who heard the evidence is  in a"
"High Court, the same principles apply and the succeeding Judge can"
"write the Judgment acting upon the evidence already recorded by his"
"predecessor after notifying and informing the parties of the case."
