"LA No: SC/SPL/LA/267/2018 (Rajapakse Gedara Nandasena alias"
"kirikolla V. The Hon. Attorney General) – decided on 05.04.2024 as"
"follows:"
"“This  amendment  removed  the  right  of  the  parties  to  civil  actions  to"
"demand  the  resummoning  and  rehearing  of  witnesses.  Following  the"
"amendment,  this  right 
is  now  confined  only  to  accused  persons 
in"
"criminal cases."
"This amendment also restricted the accused’s rights, which he previously"
"enjoyed. After the amendment, there is no compulsion on the part of the"
"Court to resummon and rehear witnesses and commence the trial afresh"
"when an application is made by the accused; the part “in which case the"
"trial shall commence afresh” found in the original proviso was removed."
"By removing that portion, the legislature granted the Court the discretion"
"to decide whether to allow the accused’s application to resummon and"
"rehear  witnesses,  based  on 
the 
facts  and  circumstances  of  each"
"individual case.”"
