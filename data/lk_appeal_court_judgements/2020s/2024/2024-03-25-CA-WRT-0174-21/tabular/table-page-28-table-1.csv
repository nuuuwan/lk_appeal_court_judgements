"Complaint made by Nissanka Senadhipathi. The Petitioner states that the Petitioner made a"
"further  application  subject  to  the  objection,  that  the  Petitioner  has  not  received  any"
"document  in  relation  to  the  Inquiry,  and  that  even  though  the  Petitioner  was  made  a"
"Respondent, he has not been provided with the Complaint that is made the subject matter to"
"the 
impugned 
inquiry.  The  Petitioner  states 
that 
therefore, 
the  Petitioner  made  an"
"application 
to 
the  commission 
requesting 
the  copy  of 
the  complaint  made  and 
the"
"proceedings pertaining to the inquiry."
"Thereafter, the Petitioner presented himself before the said Commission on the 30.06.2020"
"together  with  the  Counsels  appearing  for  the  Petitioner.  The  Petitioner  states  that  the"
"Counsel appearing for the Petitioner raised a preliminary objection before the Commission as"
"to the Jurisdiction of the said Commission to conduct the impugned inquiry. The Petitioner"
"states  that  it  was  contended  by  the  Counsel  appearing  for  the  Petitioner  and  the  other"
"Respondents  summoned  by  the  Commission,  that  the 
impugned 
inquiry  could  not  be"
"sustained before the Commission and that in such circumstances, the Commission could not"
"issue summons on the Petitioner and the other Respondents named thereto, and that such"
"action is Ultra Vires and illegal.  Despite the preliminary objections raised by the Counsels for"
"the Petitioner, and also by the other Respondents summoned by the Commission, the 1st -3rd"
"Respondents overruled the objection and refused to make any order regarding the same and"
"stated inter alia that, the Commission has come to a conclusion regarding jurisdiction at the"
"time  of  accepting  the  complaint  filed  by Mr.  Nissanka  Senadhipathi,  and  thus,  there  is  no"
"necessity to make order in such regard and merely and simply continued with the inquiry."
"Thereafter, the Counsel appearing for the Petitioner made an application to the Commission"
"that, the Petitioner would appear before the Commission, however, subject to the objection"

"""complaint  of  political  victimization  made  by  Nissanka  Senadhipathi,  the  Chairman  of  the"
"Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pvt.) Ltd."" (here in after referred to as the Complainant). The"
"Petitioner states that however, neither the complaint nor the allegation against the Petitioner"
