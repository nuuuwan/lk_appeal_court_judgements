"the money from the 11th Respondent to pay the bank and once the Petitioners obtain the"
"said dues from Maga Neguma, the Petitioners could pay the 1st Respondent."
"T
he main contention of the learned Counsel is that the Petitioners have performed the work"
"for the State when they entered into contracts with Maga Neguma to which the Petitioners"
"have to receive the payments. To carry out the said road construction work, the Petitioners"
"have obtained several loans as the working capital. These facilities were obtained in the"
"form of TOD’s and loans from the 1st Respondent, which the Petitioners were unable to"
"pay as a result of a non-payment to the Petitioners by the 11th Respondent. The Petitioners"
"contend that the People’s Bank is a State bank and therefore the Petitioners have obtained"
"the loan from the State. Hence, the argument that the Petitioners have obtained loans to"
"carry out construction work for the State."
"T
his Court is unable to agree with the said submission as the Petitioners have obtained a"
"loan not from the State but from the 1st Respondent which is a creature of a statute with a"
"distinct legal entity. The relationship between the Petitioners and the 1st Respondent is a"
"contractual relationship pertaining to obtaining a loan from the 1st Respondent bank. This"
"contractual relationship is independent of the work the Petitioners alleged to have carried"
"out for Maga Neguma."
"T
he Petitioners obtained the facilities from the 1st Respondent by mortgaging the property"
"in the schedule as security. There is no contest between the parties as to the fact that the"
"Petitioners have failed to honour the facility given by the 1st Respondent. The Petitioners"
"are not contending that the 1st Respondent cannot avail themselves of the statutory rights"
"granted  to  them.  However,  the  Petitioners  alleged  that  the  amounts  claimed  by  the  1st"
"Respondent are in excess and the interest charged is unreasonable, ultra vires, and bad in"
"law."
