"It has been held in W. E. De Zylva, v. The Queen- 66 NLR 92 that"
"even in a charge of Criminal Breach of Trust, if the time period exceeds"
"one year, the charge is defective and illegal. In this case, the accused"
"was charged for committing criminal breach of trust between the 7th"
"day of January 1959 and the 8th day of January 1960. It was held that"
"the charge, by taking in a period in excess of one year, was defective"
"in that it contravened the provisions of section 168 (2) of the Criminal"
"Procedure Code. Such a charge is illegal and not merely irregular."
"[Emphasis added]"
