"Considering the grounds upon a retrial should be considered, in the case of L.C."
"Fernando Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka 79-II NLR 313 at 374 it was held:"
"“It is a basic principle of the criminal law of our land, that a retrial is to be"
"ordered only, if it appears to the Court that the interests of justice so require."
"The charge laid against the accused is of serious nature, and it may be, a"
"trial  Court  may  find  the  accused  guilty  at  a  retrial  upon  relevant  and"
"admissible evidence. But it must be remembered that the acquisitions have"
"been made about seven years ago."
"…Further, the trial had been long and protracted. There have been no less"
"than thirty-five trial dates. The accused would have to bear undue hardship"
"and  heavy  expense  to  defend  himself  again.  I  must  also  state  that  the"
"defence in no way contributed to the reception of inadmissible and irrelevant"
"evidence, which prejudice the trial."
"Under the circumstances, it seems to me to be harsh and unjust to order a"
"retrial. It does not appear to me that the interests of justice require a retrial.”"
