"It  is  well  settled  law  that  the  duty  of  a  trial  Judge  is  to  consider  the  evidence"
"placed before the Court by both the prosecution and the defence as a whole, and"
"come  to  his  findings,  rather  than  compartmentalizing  as  happened  in  the"
"impugned Judgement."
"In the case of James Silva Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 SLR 167,"
"the trial Judge stated that, “I had considered the defence of the accused and I"
"hold  that  it  is  untenable  and  false  in  the  light  of  the  evidence  led  by  the"
"prosecution.”"
