"The incident relating to this case has occurred on 14-08-1996, nearly 28 years"
"ago. As observed correctly by the learned High Court Judge in the judgement as"
"well, it has taken nearly 20 years after  the incident for the  1st  witness to give"
"evidence  before  the  trial  Court.  By  that  time,  two  of  the  accused  had  already"
"been dead, and after the conviction, another accused had also passed away."
"The evidence of the key witnesses when they gave evidence nearly 20 years after"
"the incident shows that they have forgotten most of the material points. There is"
"no basis to believe that if they were to be called upon to give evidence again some"
"28 years after the event, their evidence would be reliable or can be relied upon"
"to find the accused guilty."
"The appellants had been in incarceration from the date of their conviction on 08-"
"11-2017, which amounts to more than five years in total."
"For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that no purpose would be"
"served by sending the case back for a re-trial after such a long period from the"
"date of the crime."
"Therefore, I acquit the accused appellants from the charges."
