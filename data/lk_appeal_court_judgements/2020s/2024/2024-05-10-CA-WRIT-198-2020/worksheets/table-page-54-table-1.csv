"pretended by this return, that the vice-chancellor's court had any power to degrade. Neither does"
"it appear that Dr. Bentley was ever summoned to answer this contempt ; and it is against natural"
"justice to deprive a man of his right before he is heard ; therefore if there was a custom so to"
"do,  such  custom  would  be  absolutely  void  ;  and  it  is  a  thing  of  daily  experience  to  grant"
"prohibitions to Spiritual Courts, if they deny the defendants a copy of the libel, because such"
"denial is against natural justice. And now to offer a common instance, viz. suppose an officer of"
"this  Court  should  show  any  contempt  thereof,  could  he  be  deprived  of  his  office  for  such"
"contempt? Certainly he could not. It is true, they who have argued for the university insisted, that"
"the  proceedings  there  are  according  to  the  civil  law,  and  this  they  have  done  to  justify  the"
"suspension, without being summoned to answer the contempt; but it does not appear upon the"
"return (upon which this Court is (164] to judge), that they proceed there by the civil law ; and if"
"so, then the Court must intend that they proceed by the common law, which they have not done,"
"for there is no manner of proof that the doctor was surnmoned to appear to answer the contempt;"
"and it can  never  be  said,  that a court which proceeds according to the common (a) law, shall"
"suspend or degrade a person without being heard or summoned. It is said likewise, that this was"
"not a proceeding by virtue of a charter alone, but by a charter-confirmed by Act of Parliament."
"Now admitting that to be true, it must be granted that convictions, even upon Acts of Parliament,"
"are frequently quashed, for not summoning the persons convicted, though not required by the"
"statute,  because  it  is  still  against  natural  justice  to  convict  without  hearing,  The  want  of  a"
"summons is an objection that can never be got over. Had the custom been returned to deprive"
"without summons, it had been void, as against natural justice. If a justice of peace convict any"
"man without a summons, such conviction is void. I heard a learned civilian say, that God himself"
"would not condemn Adam for his transgression until he had called him to know what he could"
"say in his defence. Gen. iii. 9. Such proceeding is agreeable to justice. Admitting the university"
"has a jurisdiction, yet this Court will inquire what they have done, and how they have used that"
"jurisdiction, as it was done in * Bushel's9 case, where it was insisted, that the merits of the cause"
"could not be inquired into upon the return of a habeas corpes, but it was over-ruled ; and this"
"Court cannot affirm the proceedings in this case without over-ruling Bushel's case, and several"
"other authorities of the like nature."
"For which reasons the Court was unanimous in granting a peremptory mandamus; and in Easter"
"term, in the tenth year of George the First, the doctor was restored to his degree."
