"Respondent, 1950 it was said by Lord Radcliffe, that,",""
"“It 
is  that  characteristic  that  the  Controller","lacks 
in  acting  under,"
"","Regulation 62. In truth when he cancels a licence he is not determining a"
"","question: he is taking executive action to withdraw a privilege because he"
"","believes and has reasonable grounds to believe that the holder is unfit to"
"","retain it. But, that apart, no procedure is laid down by the Regulation for"
"","securing  that  the  licence  holder  is  to  have  notice  of  the  Controller's"
"","intention to revoke the licence, or that there must be any inquiry, public"
"","or private, before the Controller acts.  The licence holder has no right to"
"appeal  to  the  Controller  or","from  the  Controller.  In  brief,  the  power"
"","conferred upon the Controller by Regulation 62 stands by itself upon the"
"","bare  words  of  the  Regulation  and,  if  the  mere  requirement  that  the"
"","Controller must have reasonable grounds of belief is insufficient to oblige"
"","him to act judicially, there is nothing else in the context or conditions of"
"","his jurisdiction that suggests that he must regulate his action by analogy"
"to judicial rules”.",""
