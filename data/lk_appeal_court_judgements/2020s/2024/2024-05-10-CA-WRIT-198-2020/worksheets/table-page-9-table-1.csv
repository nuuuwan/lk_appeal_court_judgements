"“The first clear denial of the role of natural justice occurred in a case from"
"Ceylon  in  which  the  Privy  Council  held  that  a  textile  trader  could  be"
"deprived of his trading licence without any kind of [a] hearing. The charge"
"against him was that his firm had falsified paying-in slips when banking"
"coupons under the scheme of control. The Controller in fact arranged an"
"inquiry in which the trader and his witnesses were heard. The Supreme"
"Court  of  Ceylon,  following  familiar  English  authorities,  held  that  the"
"circumstances demanded a fair hearing, but that it had in fat being given."

"necessary."
"The judgment, delivered by Lord Radcliffe, stated that there was no ground"
"for holding that the Controller was a acting judicially or quasi-judicially;"
"that he was not determining a question but withdrawing a privilege; and"
"that  nothing  in  the  regulations  or  in  the  conditions  of  his  jurisdiction"

"that there was nothing to consider beyond the bare words, and that the"
"right to a hearing could be determined as if the question had never before"
"arisen in an English court."
"Not long afterwards (what was then) the Queen's Bench Division held that"
"a London taxi driver’s license could be revoked without a hearing by the"
"Metropolitan Police Commissioner. Here again, the licensing authority did"
"not in fact act without granting a hearing: the driver was allowed to appear"
"before the licensing committee, but the committee would not allow him to"
"call a witness to controvert the evidence of the police. He complained that"
