"“So far as the rules of natural justice are concerned, it is suggested that"
"before  the  National  Executive  Committee  suspended  the  committee  and"
"officers they should have been heard, and the fact that they were not heard"
"was  a  breach  of  the  rules  of  natural  justice  sufficient  to  invalidate  the"
"suspension.  It  seems  to  me  that  this  suspension  was  an  administrative"
"action  which  by  its  very  nature  had  to  be  taken  immediately.  It  was"
"impossible  for  the  National  Executive  Committee  at  that  stage-  and  I"
"emphasise those words  “at that stage”  – to hear both sides. In the most"
"types of investigation there is in the early stages a point at which action of"
"some  sort  must  be  taken  and  must  be  taken  firmly  in  order  to  set  the"
"wheels of investigation in motion. Natural justice will seldom if ever at that"
"stage  demand  that  the  investigator  should  act  judicially  in  the  sense  of"
"having to hear both sides. No one’s livelihood or reputation at that stage"
"is in danger. But the further the proceedings go and the nearer they get to"
"the imposition of a penal sanction or to damaging someone’s reputation or"
"to inflicting financial loss on someone the more necessary it becomes to"
"act judicially, and the greater the importance of observing the maxim audi"
"alteram partem. It seems to me in the present case, so far as one can judge"
"on the facts before us, natural justice does not demand that anyone should"
"be invited to provide an explanation or excuse before that suspension was"
"imposed.” (page 28 of the judgment)"
"The facts of the case in very brief appear in the passage reproduced below"
