"In addition to what was said above on the maxim ex facto jus oritur, in every"
"dispute if a party wants to find, there can be enough factual disputes. But the"
"dispute this court in this WRIT application has to decide is not whether the tea"
"was adulterated or not."
"The question for this court is whether it was of importance to notify the petitioner"
"before the suspension took place or not."
"The  right  (or  even  the  privilege  for  that  matter)  of  the  respondents  to  collect"
"samples, test them, come to findings not disputed by the petitioner. The dispute"
"is whether purportedly acting on those findings, whether the respondents, or any"
"one or more of them, had a duty in law, to ask the petitioner, is there anything"
"for him to say for himself, before his right to produce tea is interfered with by"
"suspending his license."
