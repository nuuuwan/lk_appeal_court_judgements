"be in court, but what is material is to consider whether that is the question in"
"issue in the application for writ. As it is said “law arises from facts” (Ex facto jus"
"oritur). The law which has arisen from the facts of this case is whether before"
"suspension  of  the  petitioner  on  02.07.2020  the  petitioner  should  have  been"
"informed,  in  a  manner  that  will  make  it  possible  for  the  petitioner  to  say"
"something on his behalf, or not."
"As  far  as  that  is  concerned,  there  is  no disputed  fact  in  this  case,  which  this"
"court is asked to decide."
"The  argument  of  the  Petitioner  is  that  it  was  not  given  any  prior  notice  of"
"suspension, and not afforded an inquiry as provided for in section 8(2) the Tea"
"Control Act. Respondents accept the above position especially that prior notice"
"was not given by the following position they take at paragraph 92 of the written"
"submissions."
