"This  was  addressed  by  no  other  person  than  Alexander  Hamilton  himself  in"
"Federalist Papers3  No 84 saying,"
"‘The most considerable of the remaining objections is that the plan of"
"the convention contains no bill of rights. Among other answers given to"
"this, it has been upon different occasions remarked that the constitutions"
"of several of the States are in a similar predicament. I add that New York"
"is of the number. And yet the opposers of the new system, in this State,"
"who profess an unlimited admiration for its constitution, are among the"
"most intemperate partisans of a bill of rights. To justify their zeal in this"
"matter, they allege two things: one is that, though the constitution"
"of New York has no bill of rights prefixed to it, yet it contains, in the"
"body  of  it,  various  provisions  in  favor  of  particular  privileges  and"
"rights, which, in substance amount to the same thing; the other is, that"
"the Constitution adopts, in their full extent, the common and statute law"
"of  Great  Britain,  by  which  many  other  rights,  not  expressed  in  it,  are"
"equally secured.’"
