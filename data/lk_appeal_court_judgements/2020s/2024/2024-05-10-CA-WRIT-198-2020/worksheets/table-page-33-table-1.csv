"","years. The plaintiff had been treasurer of his branch, and was chairman"
"","of it at the date of the resolution. The complaint against him related solely"
"","to his conduct as treasurer; and the resolution was passed without hearing"
"","the plaintiff or giving him any opportunity of explaining. P. G. Lawrence,"
"","J., construed the rules strictly, and held that the language of the rule did"
"","not authorise the resolution that was passed. He went on to consider the"
"","position if he were wrong in thus construing the rules, and said: ""I have"
"","no hesitation in holding that the power to suspend or expel a member for"
"","acting  contrary 
to 
the  rules 
is  one  of  a  quasi-judicial  nature.""  He"
"","accordingly  held  the  resolution  bad  because  the  plaintiff  had  not  been"
"","given an opportunity of being heard in his defence. In relation to the rule"
"","of  natural  justice,  P.  O.  Lawrence,  J.,  thus  made  no  distinction"
"","between  suspension  and  expulsion.  I  would  respectfully  concur:  in"
"","essence suspension is merely expulsion pro tanto. Each is penal, and"
"","each  deprives  the  member  concerned  of  the  enjoyment  of  his  rights  of"
"","membership or office. Accordingly, in my judgment the rules of natural"
"","justice  prima  facie  apply  to  any process  of  suspension  in  the  same"
"","way that they apply to expulsion. Lord Denning in Lewis v. Heffer (5),"
"","having quoted the last few lines above said: ""Those words apply, no doubt,"
"","to suspensions which are inflicted by way of punishment, as for instance"
"","when a member of the Bar is suspended from practice for six months, or"
"","when  a  solicitor  is  suspended  from  practice.  But  they  do  not  apply  to"
"","suspensions which are made, as a holding operation, pending enquires."
"","Very often irregularities are disclosed in a government department or in a"
"","business  house;  and  a  man  may  be  suspended  on  full  pay  pending"
"","inquiries. Suspicion may rest on him; and so he is suspended until he is"
"","cleared  of  it.  No  one,  so  far  as  I  know,  has  ever  questioned  such  a"
"","suspension  on  the  ground  that  it  could  not  be  done  unless  he  is  given"
"","notice of the charge and an opportunity of defending himself, and so forth."
"","The  suspension 
in  such  a  case 
is  merely  done  by  way  of  good"
