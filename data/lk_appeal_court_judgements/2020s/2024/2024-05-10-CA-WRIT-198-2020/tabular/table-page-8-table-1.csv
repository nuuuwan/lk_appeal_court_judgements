"or  otherwise.  The  Constitution  of  1978  commences  on  a  basis,  at  least  in"
"principle,  similar  to  the  American  constitution,  although  the  phrase  “We  the"
"people….” is not there. But the Preamble starts by saying, “The PEOPLE OF SRI"
"LANKA having, by their Mandate freely expressed and granted….” It also says,"
"that,  “WE,  THE  FREELY  ELECTED  REPRESENTATIVES  OF  THE  PEOPLE  OF"
"SRI  LANKA, 
in  pursuance  of  such  Mandate,  humbly  acknowledging  our"
"obligations 
to  our  People  and 
gratefully 
remembering 
their  heroic  and"
"unremitting struggle to regain and preserve their rights and privileges so that"
"the  Dignity  and  Freedom  of  the 
Individual  may  be  assured,  Just,  Social,"
"Economic and Cultural Order attained….”"
"Although  there  is  a  privileged  class,  which  comes  within  the  scope  of  social"
"science in any country, law is a refination (I mean a refinement, but better to have"
"a word that emphasizes the action of refining) of one of those social sciences, in"
"the scope of which; and under a constitution such as that of 1978 in Sri Lanka,"
"only “privilege” recognized by law is immunity which the constitution describes;"
"and all the other kinds of phenomena that exists enabling people to perform acts,"
"including the manufacture of tea, are rights. A right is regulated by a licence,"
"that is true. It is done for the public good and welfare, not because the state"
"is the fountain that bestows that  “right” like a king granting a privilege."
"The “right” belong to the people; it is “regulated” for the people; and it is done"
"by  the  people;  albeit  through  their  representatives,  for  convenience.  That  is  a"
"democracy. That is an Act that empowers granting, suspending; and cancelling"
"licences. The Constitution at its Article 14(g) recognizes, “the freedom to engage"
"by  himself  or  in  association  with  others  in  any  lawful  occupation,  profession,"
"trade, business or enterprise;….” The production of tea is one such occupation,"
"profession, trade, business or enterprise. Furthermore, like all agriculture is, it"
"is a method of production of wealth. Hence granting a license either by the state"
"or some public or private authority on its behalf does not mean that it is a grant"
"of a privilege."
