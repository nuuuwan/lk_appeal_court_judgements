"Hence that case can be even categorized under a judgment in which"
"the question of the applicability of the rules of natural justice never arose."
"Therefore, whereas Denning L. J., said the suspension in question was"
"a  punishment  Geoffery  Lane  J.,  said  the  applicability  of  rules  of  natural"
"justice  does  not  arise  hence  what  the  respondent’s  cite  as  favourable  to"
"them was clearly said in obiter."
"Furthermore  Denning  L.J.,  commencing  his  speech,  in  his  customary"
"short sentences of precise meaning said,  “This is an urgent case. So we must"
"proceed 
to  give 
judgment  at  once”. 
(page  02  of 
the 
judgment)  Therefore"
"admittedly, to observe with respect, the questions have not been considered in"
"great depth."
"Denning L.J., had referred to John vs. Rees (1968) in the aforesaid case."
"It is pertinent to note what Megarry J., said in that case. One of the questions"
"considered in that case was the applicability of the rule, audi alteram partem."
"Although 
it  was  considered 
in  regard  to  “expulsion”  and  “ipso  facto"
"cessation  of  membership”,  it  applies  in  equal  force  to  the  difference"
"between “suspension” and “cancellation” in the present case."
"It was said,"
"“In the present case, there has not in terms been any process of expulsion."
"Instead, there has been the process which, on Mr. Sparrow's argument,"
"resulted in what for brevity may be described as an ipso facto cessation of"
"membership  which,  he  contended,  ""got  round  all  problems  relating  to"
"from  the  point  of  view  of  the  members, 
expulsion.""  Considered"
"however,  the  practical  result  is  indistinguishable  from  expulsion."
"Before, 
they  were  members;  after, 
they  had  been  deprived  of 
their"
"membership against their will. The precise legal description of the process"
"by which this occurred, whether by destruction of their own membership,"
