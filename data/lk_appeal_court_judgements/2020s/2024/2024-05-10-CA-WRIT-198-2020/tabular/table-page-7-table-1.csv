"","‘It has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights are, in their"
"","origin,  stipulations  between  kings  and  their  subjects,  abridgements  of"
"","prerogative in favour of privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to"
"","the prince. Such was MAGNA CHARTA, obtained by the barons, sword in"
"","hand, from King John. Such were the subsequent confirmations of that"
"charter  by  succeeding  princes.  Such  was","the  PETITION  OF  RIGHT"
"","assented to by Charles I., in the beginning of his reign. Such, also, was the"
"","Declaration of Right presented by the Lords and Commons to the Prince"
"","of  Orange  in  1688,  and  afterwards  thrown  into  the  form  of  an  act  of"
"","parliament  called  the  Bill  of  Rights.  It  is  evident,  therefore,  that,"
"","according to their primitive signification, they have no application to"
"","constitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people, and"
"","executed by their immediate representatives and servants. Here, in"
"","strictness,  the  people  surrender  nothing;  and  as  they  retain  every"
"","thing they have no need of particular reservations. ""WE, THE PEOPLE"
"","of the United States, to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our"
"","posterity,  do  ORDAIN  and  ESTABLISH  this  Constitution  for  the  United"
"","States  of  America.""  Here  is  a  better  recognition  of  popular  rights,  than"
"","volumes of those aphorisms which make the principal figure in several of"
"","our State bills of rights, and which would sound much better in a treatise"
"","of ethics than in a constitution of government.’ ’ [Emphasis added in this"
