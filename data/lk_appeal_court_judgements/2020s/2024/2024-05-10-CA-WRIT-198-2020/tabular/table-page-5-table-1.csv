"‘The rights themselves thus defined by those several statutes, consist in a"
"number  of  private  immunities;  which  will  appear,  from  what  has  been"
"premised,  to  be  indeed  no  other,  than  either  the  residuum  of  natural"
"liberty,  which  is  not  required  by  the  laws  of  society  to  be  sacrificed  to"
"public convenience;  or else those civil privileges, which society hath"
"engaged  to  provide,  in  lieu  of  the  natural  liberties  so  given  up  by"
"individuals’."
