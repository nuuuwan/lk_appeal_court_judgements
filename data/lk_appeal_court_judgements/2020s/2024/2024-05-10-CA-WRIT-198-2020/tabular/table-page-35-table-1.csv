"","To quote the first passage relied upon by the first respondent in the speech"
"of Lord Denning in full it was said.",""
"","“But  then  comes  the  point:  Are  the  National  Executive  Committee  to"
"","observe the rules of natural justice? In John v. Rees Mr. Justice Megarry"
"","held that they were. He said (at page 397): “Suspension is merely expulsion"
"","pro tanto. Each is penal, and each deprives the member concerned of the"
"","enjoyment  of  his  rights  of  membership  or  office.  Accordingly 
in  my"
"","judgment the rules of natural justice prima facie apply to any such process"
"","of suspension in the same way that they apply to expulsion.”"
"","“Those words apply, no doubt, to suspensions which are inflicted by way"
"","of punishment: as for instance when a member of the bar is suspended"
"","from  practice  for  six  months,  or  when  a  solicitor  is  suspended  from"
"","practice.  But  they  do  not  apply  to  suspensions  which  are  made,  as  a"
"","holding  operation,  pending 
enquiries.  Very  often 
irregularities  are"
"","disclosed in a Government department or in a business house: and a man"
"","may be suspended on a full pay pending enquiries. Suspicion may rest"
"","on him: and so, he is suspended until he is cleared of it. No one, so far as"
"","I know, has ever questioned such a suspension on the ground that it could"
"","not be done unless he is given notice of the charge and an opportunity of"
"","defending himself, and so forth. The suspension in such a case is merely"
"","done  by  way  of  good  administration.  A  situation  has  arisen  in  which"
"","something must be done at once. The work of the department or the office"
"","is being affected by roumers and suspicions. The others will not trust the"
"","man. In order to get back to proper work, the man is suspended. At that"
"","stage the rules of natural justice do not apply, see Furnell’s case (1973)"
"","Appeal Cases 660.” (page 17 of the judgment)"
