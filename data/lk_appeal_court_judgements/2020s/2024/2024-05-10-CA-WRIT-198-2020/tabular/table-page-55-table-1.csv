"In  the  present  case  too,  the  01st  respondent  was,  under  a  duty  to  hear  the"
"petitioner before P.02 and P.03 were issued. Furthermore, the 01st respondent,"
"at the very least, had 03 days to do so."
"Hence,  I  hold  that  there  was  a  duty  cast  upon  the  Tea  Controller  to  hear  the"
"petitioner before deciding whether to suspend or not as per section 8(2) of the"
"said Act."
"In the circumstances, this Court grants  the reliefs (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j) of the"
"petition of the petitioner dated 29.07.2020."
