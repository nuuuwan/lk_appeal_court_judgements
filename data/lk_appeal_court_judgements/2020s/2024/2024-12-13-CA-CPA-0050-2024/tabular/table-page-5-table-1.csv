"They attempted to obtain a written statement from the Registrar of the Matara"
"High  Court  before  filing  the  new  appeals  in  any  other  High  Court,  but  were"
"unsuccessful in doing so."
"Thereafter, for whatever the reason, the Petitioner filed 33 appeals in the High"
"Court of Galle on 22nd April 2024. These appeals were accepted by the registry"
"and assigned numbers ranging from LTAP/1681/2024 to LTAP/1713/2024."
"The Petitioner claims that on 29th April 2024, the learned High Court Judge of"
"Galle,  without  providing  an  opportunity  for  a  hearing  to  the  Appellant  (the"
"Petitioner  in  the  present  application),  proceeded  to  make  the  impugned  order,"
"dismissing all the appeals, including the present appeal. This is a clear violation"
"of the principle of natural justice, audi alteram partem. Additionally, it is stated"
"that the said order was never communicated to the Petitioner. The certified copy"
"of  the  order  filed  by  the  Petitioner  indicates  that  there  was  no  appearance  on"
"behalf of either party in the High Court of Galle."
"The learned High Court Judge of Galle observed that, since the appeal stemmed"
"from  an  order  made  by  the  Labour  Tribunal  of  Matara,  it  should  have,  under"
"ordinary circumstances, been filed in the High Court of Matara. I concede that"
"the Petitioner ought to have pursued this course of action. Nevertheless, as per"
"the prevailing law, the Appellant is entitled to file the appeal in any of the High"
"Courts within the province."
"Governing statutory provisions"
"To  clarify  the  position  above,  I  will  first  cite  the  relevant  provisions  of  the"
"applicable statutes below."
"Article 154 (P) of the Constitution provides as follows;"
"‘154P (1) There shall be a High Court for each Province with effect from the"
"date  on  which  this  Chapter  comes  into  force.  Each  such  High  Court  shall  be"
"designated as the High Court of the relevant Province.’"
