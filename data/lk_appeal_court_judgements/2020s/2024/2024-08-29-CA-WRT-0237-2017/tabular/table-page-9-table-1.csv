"T
he  petitioner  did  not  produce  any  acceptable  evidence  to  show  that  the"
"Land Reform Commission was the owner of the two paddy lands in issue."
"The  commissioner  has  no  reason  to  believe  that  there  was  a  real  dispute"
"regarding ownership. Even the LRC had not produced any documents to the"
"effect that it was the owner of two paddy lands in issue. Therefore, the order"
"of the Commissioner of Agrarian Development is well within the law. We see"
"no reason to grant the reliefs sought by the petitioner. The application of the"
"petitioner is therefore, dismissed."
