"his  judgment  that  the  only  explanation  that  can  be  given  to  the  said"
"statement  of  the  appellant  is  that  his  brother  has  assaulted  him  by"
"something that was used to attack the deceased."
"There  is  nothing  wrong  with  that  observation  made  by  the  learned"
"Judge because it is apparent from the evidence that only the appellant,"
"the  first  accused,  and  the  deceased  were  there  when  this  incident"
"occurred.  Therefore,  the  appellant’s  brother  must  have  attacked  the"
"deceased with some weapon, as it was not possible for the deceased to"
"attack himself. In the said circumstances, the only inference that could"
"be drawn from the appellant’s statement that “...යද්දිම අයේ තිබුණ මැරිච්ච"
"යෙනාට  යොටපු  එයෙන්  මට  යෙටුවා.”    is  that  the  appellant’s  brother  has"
"attacked the appellant by using the same thing that was used to attack"
"the deceased."
"In addition, the third ground raised by the learned President’s Counsel"
"was that the learned trial Judge expected proof of the defence case. The"
"learned  Trial  Judge  observed  that  the  defence  that  was  taken  in  the"
"dock statement that he went to the place of the incident to settle the"
"dispute  had  not  been  suggested  to  the  prosecution  witnesses  and"
"therefore,  the  unreliable  dock  statement  does  not  cast  a  reasonable"
"doubt on the prosecution case. The contention of the learned President’s"
"Counsel was that the said observation is erroneous because it amounts"
"to proving of the defence case."
"I regret that I am unable to agree with the said contention of the learned"
"President’s Counsel because if the appellant took up a certain position"
"that was not taken up in cross-examining the prosecution witnesses, it"
"is  correct  to  conclude  that  it  is  an  unacceptable  afterthought.  When"
"PW-1 and PW-4 stated in their evidence that the appellant and the first"
"accused came together armed with an iron bar and a dagger, it has not"
"been even suggested to these witnesses that the appellant did not come"
"with the first accused, and he came later to that place. In addition, it"
"has not been suggested to the prosecution witnesses that the appellant"
