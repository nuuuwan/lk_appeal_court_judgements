"been suggested to PW-4 on behalf of the appellant that her evidence of"
"hearing  such  shouting  is  false  or  that  her  evidence  that  one  of  them"
"came with an iron bar and the other person came with a dagger is false."
"In the case of Himachal Pradesh V. Thakur Dass (1983) 2 Cri. L.J."
"1694  at  1701  V.D.  Misra  CJ  held  that  “whenever  a  statement  of  fact"
"made by a witness is not challenged in cross-examination, it has to be"
"concluded that the fact in question is not disputed. Similarly, in Motilal"
"V. State of Madhya Pradesh (1990) Criminal Law Journal NOC 125"
"MP 
it  was  held  that  “Absence  of  cross-examination  of  prosecution"
"witness of certain facts, leads to inference of admission of that fact.”"
"It was held in the previously stated judgment of  Queen V. Mahatun,"
"that  it  is  not  essential  to  prove  a  pre-arranged  plan  to  establish  the"
"existence of a common intention. However, in the case at hand, the pre-"
"arrangement  is  clearly  established  because  when  the  twin  brothers"
"reached the house of the deceased, the first accused had told, brother"
"come, he is here (අයියේ වයෙන්, ඉන්නවා).  Thereafter, both of them grabbed"
"the  deceased  and  assaulted  him.  It  clearly  reflects  that  the  appellant"
"came  with  his  brother 
in  search  of  the  deceased.  Their  common"
"intention  with  a  pre-plan  of  causing  a  fatal  injury  to  the  deceased  is"
"also apparent as they came with an iron bar and a dagger."
"The Assistant Judicial Medical Officer was of the opinion that the fatal"
"head injury could have been caused by an iron bar. PW-1 stated that"
"twin brothers came together, they assaulted the deceased and one of"
"them struck the deceased with an iron bar. PW-4 has also stated in her"
"evidence that the first accused and the appellant came together, they"
"caught and held the deceased, and the deceased was beaten. She stated"
"further that three of them wrestled there, then the deceased fell on the"
"ground and after he fell, two of them continued to beat the deceased."
"Furthermore, PW-4 stated that the deceased had been dragged about"
"fifty meters from home and even when the police officers came there,"
"two of them were beating the deceased."
