"T
he learned High Court Judge, in his judgment had extensively discussed"
"the identification of the Appellants by PW1. The defense did not succeed in"
"creating a doubt with regard to the identification of the Appellants. Hence,"
"in this case, the identification of the Appellants is not an issue as claimed by"
"the Respondent."
"F
urther,  I  consider  it  worthy  to  mention  the  remorse  expressed  by  the"
"Appellant to PW1. The 2nd Appellant along with the 1st Appellant had gone to"
"PW1’s  house  after  her  return  from  the  hospital.  The  2nd  Appellant  had"
"confessed to PW1 revealing facts about the way they planned the attack and"
"their motive. She had also told her the composition of the acid that was used"
"in  the  attack.  Although  the  1st  Appellant  denied  the  offence  he  failed  to"
"answer  the  question  put  forward  by  PW1  regarding  the  clothes  he  was"
"wearing when he attacked the her with acid. This had also been considered"
"by the learned High Court Judge to arrive at his decision."
"T
he  principle  of  the ‘Common  Intention’ is  that  if  two  or  more  people  who"
"possess  the  same  intention  get  together  for  the  purpose  of  achieving  their"
"common target and they act in furtherance of the common intention of all,"
"in such an instance all persons who have participated in the commission of"
"the act would be become jointly liable and will face criminal charges together."
"I
n this case evidence transpired that the Appellants had actuated common"
"intention  at  the  time  of  committing  the  offence.    They  had  the  common"
"intention to achieve the particular consequences. As long as they entertain"
"such intention jointly, they will be held jointly responsible for their actions."
