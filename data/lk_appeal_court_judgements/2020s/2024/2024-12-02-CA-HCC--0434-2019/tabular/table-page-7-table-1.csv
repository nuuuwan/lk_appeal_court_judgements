"According to PW1 the substance recovered from the Appellant weighed about"
"25.110  grams.  The  production  was  properly  entered  in  the  production"
"register  and  dispatched  to  the  Government  Analyst  Department.  But  the"
"Government Analyst weighed the production at 24.74 grams which is 1.36"
"grams  less  than  the  original  weight.  Comparing  with  the  net  weight  5.58"
"grams  of  Heroin,  the  discrepancy  is  very  much  notable  in  this  case.  This"
"cannot  be  simply  disregarded  without  any  plausible  explanation.  But  the"
"prosecution  was  unable  to  explain  the  discrepancy  in  the  weight  of  the"

"Naturally,  the  Defence  can  challenge  the  chain  of  custody  evidence  by"
"questioning whether the evidence presented at trial is the same evidence as"
"what was collected from the accused person."
"The Appellant takes up the position that the amount of Heroin which had"
"been  mentioned  in  the  indictment  was  not  recovered  from  her.  But  she"
"admits that she was arrested on the date mentioned in the indictment at her"
"residence."
"In this regard, the learned High Court Judge in his judgment had not made"
"any  comments  about  a  discrepancy  in  weight  in  the  given  case.  In  the"
"absence  of  any  comment  regarding  this  particular  point;  no  doubt,  the"
