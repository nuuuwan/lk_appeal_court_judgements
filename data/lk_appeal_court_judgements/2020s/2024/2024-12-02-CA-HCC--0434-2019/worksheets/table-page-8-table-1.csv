"Appellant had not been afforded a fair trial. Thereby this has caused great"
"prejudice to her."
"In the final ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellant contended that"
"the  dock  statement  of  the  Appellant  was  not  properly  considered  by  the"
"learned High Court Judge.  Even though the dock statement of an accused"
"has less evidential value our courts never hesitated to accept the same when"
"it creates a doubt on the prosecution case. In this case I consider it is very"
"important to consider the dock statement of the Appellant."
