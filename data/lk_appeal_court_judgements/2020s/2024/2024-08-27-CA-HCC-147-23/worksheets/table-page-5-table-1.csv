"It has held that “section 127 of the CPC empowers the Magistrate to record any"
"statement made to him before the commencement of any inquiry or trial,"
"section 127 (3)especially deals with the recording of a statement, being a"
"confession. It requires the Magistrate not to record any such statement"
"unless upon questioning the person making it that he has reason to"
"believe that it was made voluntarily”."
"Therefore, it is very clear that their Lordships have held that even if the"
"confession is made to a Magistrate the voluntariness of the confession has to"
"be gone in to before admitting in evidence."
"Therefore section 80(3) of the Evidence Ordinance only stipulates the"
"genuineness of the document and not the voluntariness of the document."
"The Law of Evidenceby E.R.S.R Coomaraswamy Volume 2, book 1, page 136,"
"has analysed the scope and basis of Sectoin 80 and goes on to compare section"
"79 and 80 of the Evidence Ordinance and goes on to say that “section 80 does"
"not render admissible any particular type of evidence, but only dispenses with"
"the necessity for formal proof in the case of certain documents taken in judicial"
"proceedings or in accordance with the law. It presumes that all acts done in"
"respect of the document were rightly and legally done”. It has gone onto site"
"Queen v Wittie 63 N.L.R 121, where Sansoni J has said, “The presumption is"
"that all necessary formalities purporting to have been performed have in fact"

"154 at 158, where it has said that there in presumption that a confessional"
"statement was spontaneously and voluntarily done.”"
"Therefore, section 80 of the Evidence Ordinance does not take away the fact"
"that the voluntariness of the confession should be gone into. Therefore, it is the"
"opinion of this court that when a magistrate records a confession the"
"voluntariness of the statement has to be gone into."
"Hence as per the voluntariness of the confession also the above mentioned case"
"law is important and it has further held as below that “section 24 provides that"
"a confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in criminal proceedings if"
"it appears to Court to have been caused by any inducement threat or promise"
"having reference to the charge against the accused person proceeding from any"
"person in authority,or from any other person in the presence of the person in"
"authority and which is sufficient in the opinion of Court to give the accused"
"person grounds of supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or"
"avoid any evil in reference to the proceedings against him.”"
"The case law further says, “That this exception which renders a confession"
"irrelevant in criminal proceedings is based on English law and Coomaraswamy"
"has noted that Section 24 is similar to Article 22 of the Stephen’s Digest (the"
