"The deceased mother, namely Leelawathi, had given evidence on oath and had"
"stated in the High court that the deceased had been about 16/17 years at the"
"time of the offence and was the eldest of the 5 children she has had. The"
"deceased had gone missing on a date that she cannot remember and having"
"waited for a few days, she had lodged a complaint to the police. After a few"
"days, the police had taken her to Madhunagala forest, where she has seen"
"decapitated body parts, which had been beyond recognition but she had"
"identified a piece of cloth to have belonged to her deceased son, by the stitches"
"she is supposed to have made on it, just before the disappearance. Police also"
"has shown her a bottle which they believed had contained a poisonous"
"substance. This witness had been cross examined lengthily but she had stood"
"the test of cross-examination well."
"Thereafter, the prosecution had led the evidence of PW-02, namely Sirisena,"
"who is supposed to have given the information to the police on seeing scattered"
"body parts of a human being in the Madhunagala forest, when he took his"
"cattle to graze."
"Next, the prosecution had led the evidence of the learned magistrate who had"
"recorded a statement under section 127 of the Criminal Procedure Code on"
"09/04/1982. The learned magistrate had been retired at the time he had given"
"evidence and he had done so after 28 years since retiring. According to his"
"evidence, the accused-appellant was produced to his chamber by the police on"
"08/04/1982 and the accused-appellant had expressed his desire to make a"
"confession. According to his evidence, he had explained verbally the legal"
"implications of a confession and had ordered the prison authorities to keep him"
"in a separate room until the next date for him to reconsider the decision to"
"make a confession. As the next date had been a Saturday and as he had not"
"been able to get the assistance of a stenographer, the learned magistrate"
"himself had proceeded to write it in his own handwriting. Before doing so he"
"had proceeded to question the appellant whether he was under any promise,"
"threat or inducement. All those questioning had been recorded in his own hand"
"writing before the commencement of the confession. As the answers had been"
"in the negative, he had proceeded to write down the entire confession in his"
"own handwriting. The witness had been extensively cross examined as to the"
"propriety and the legality of the confession but he had stood the test of cross-"
"examination satisfactorily. The position of the defence had been that the"
"appellant never made a confession. At the end of the confession, the learned"
"magistrate has recorded the affirmation that the appellant made the confession"
"voluntarily and it was recorded rightly and correctly. After concluding the"
"evidence of the learned magistrate, the learned trial judge had heard the"
"submissions of both parties and had proceeded to admit the confession in"
"evidence."
