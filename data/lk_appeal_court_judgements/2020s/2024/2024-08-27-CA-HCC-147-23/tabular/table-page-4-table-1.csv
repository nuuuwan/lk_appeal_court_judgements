"But before admitting the confession in evidence, an inquiry has been held to"
"ascertain the voluntariness of the confession, as the defense had objected to"
"the marking of the confession in evidence. During the inquiry for the"
"voluntariness of the confession, the Magistrate had been lengthily cross"
"examined but he had stood the test of cross-examination well, as stated above."
"Under Section 80 of the Evidence Ordinance, whenever any document is"
"produced before any court purporting to be recorded during any judicial"
"proceeding such as a confession or a statement by any prisoner or accused has"
"been taken down and signed by any judge or magistrate, the courts shall"
"presume that the document is genuine and that such evidence, statement or"
"confession was duly taken."
"Hence section 80(3) of the Evidence ordinance has stated that a confession"
"duly recorded by a magistrate can be presumed to be genuine and duly taken."
"Therefore, the question arises whether the term “duly taken” means that a"
"confession recorded by a magistrate, whether a court can accept, without going"
"into the voluntariness of the confession."
"In all the decided cases relating to confessions recorded by learned"
"magistrates, when such confessions have been admitted in evidence, provisions"
"of Section 24 of the evidence ordinance have been adhered to. Therefore, it is"
"the opinion of this court that even if the magistrate has recorded a confession,"
"it is best for every court to go into the voluntariness of the confession before"
"admitting it in evidence."
"The main ground of appeal taken by the counsel for the appellant was the"
"admissibility of the confession made by the accused-appellant to the"
"magistrate."
"Under section 127 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) a magistrate"
"can record any statement or confession made to him and if it is a confession,"
"the procedure has been described under section 127 (3) of the code, where it"
"has been stated very clearly that “a magistrate shall not record any such"
"statement being a confession unless upon questioning the person making it he"
"has reason to believe that it was voluntary.”"
"Hence the basic principle behind a confession is that it has to be voluntarily"
"made without any threat or inducement."
"In the case of Nuwan De Silva V Attorney General 2005 1 SLR 146, a five"
"bench judgment by their Lordships in the Supreme Court, where S.N. Silva CJ"
"has held with the others agreeing to the steps to be followed before admitting a"
"confession made to a Magistrate being admitted in evidence."
