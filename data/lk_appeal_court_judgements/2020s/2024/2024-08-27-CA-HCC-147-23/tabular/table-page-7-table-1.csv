"initial on the side, where certain additions and alterations have been made"
"during the recording. Thereafter, at the end of the confession, he had got the"
"accused to sign and the learned magistrate himself has endorsed, according to"
"the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, that it had been made"
"voluntarily."
"All this has been very meticulously considered by the learned trial judge,"
"therefore the contention of the learned counsel for the accused-appellant, that"
"the confession is wrongly admitted in evidence is without any merit."
"According to the contents of the confession, the accused-appellant had been in"
"the company of the deceased and the first accused on the date of the incident,"
"the time had been very late in the night and during this meeting they had"
"consumed liquor. During the meeting the deceased by the first accused not to"
"shout and the accused-appellant, along with another unknown person had"
"assaulted the deceased. Thereafter the second accused had cut the deceased"
"and had separated his neck from the body. This he says has been done on the"
"instructions of the first accused. But the learned Trial judge had been careful"
"not to use this statement against the first accused."
"Therefore, according to the above mentioned confession, the culpability of the"
"accused-appellant had been very clearly adduced. Thereafter, the learned trial"
"judge in his judgement has considered to see whether the above mentioned"
"portion of the confession has been corroborated by any other evidence, and he"
"has come to the conclusion that the evidence of the deceased mother, who had"
"found the parts of the deceased body being scattered all over in the jungle,"
"which were found by a person who has gone to tie his cattle to graze in the"
"jungle (PW-03)."
"According to the confession of the second accused-appellant, before the neck of"
"the deceased had been separated from the body, the first accused had made"
"him drink poison from a bottle, according to the evidence of PW-01, PW-03 and"
"the police, there had been a small bottle found near the scattered body. This"
"particular body had been found on 11th of March, 1982, and the mother of the"
"deceased had complained to the police with regard to the disappearance of the"
"son a few days prior to the 11th of March 1982."
"Although the learned counsel for the has stated that the post mortem evidence"
"had been contrary to the contents of the confession, the learned JMO, who"
"gave evidence on the report of Professor Niriella has stated in evidence that"
"although the cause of death could not be specifically stated due to the"
"decomposed body, the JMO has said that death could have occurred in the way"
"it has been described in the confession. Therefore, we see no disparity in the"
"evidence of the JMO and the evidence given in confession."
