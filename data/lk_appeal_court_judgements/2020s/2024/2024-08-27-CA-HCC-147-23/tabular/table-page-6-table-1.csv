"Law of Evidence E.R.S.R Coomaraswamy Vol. 1, Pg 404). In English law, the"
"exception is stated in the often quoted Dictum of Lord Summer in Ibrahim v R"
"CM 5256, which reads as follows,… no statement by an accused is admissible"
"against him unless it is shown by the prosecution to have been a voluntary"
"statement, in the sense that it had not been obtained from him either by fear of"
"prejudice or hope or advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority."
"Following on the lines of the position in English law, it has been constantly"
"held by our courts that it is the burden of the prosecution to establish beyond"
"reasonable doubt that the confession is not rendered irrelevant by any"
"inducement, threat or promise as stated in Section 24. If it appears to a court"
"that any of the vitiating factors of Section 24 appears to have caused the"
"accused to make a statement, the court should rule that the statement is"
"irrelevant. E.H.T Gunasekara J, in the case of Queen v Cecilin, observed that"
"the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code referred to above and of Section"
"24 should be read together. On this basis he stated as follows: “In my Opinion"
"a confession is made voluntarily if it made is circumstances that do not render"
"it inadmissible by reason of the provisions of Section 24 of the Evidence"
"Ordinance.””"
"Further downwards the judgement has lengthily analysed Section 24 and the"
"responsibility on the magistrate to question the accused with regards to the"
"voluntariness of his to make the confession. Finally, his lordship S.N. Silva has"
"held that, “Although the question is for the judge, he should approach it"
"much as a jury would, were it for them. In other words, he should"
"understand the principle and the spirit behind it, and apply his common"
"sense, and we would add, he should remind himself that voluntary in"
"ordinary parlance means “of one’s own free will””."
"Hence as per the above judgment even if the confession has been recorded"
"by a Magistrate it has to be gone in to with regard to the voluntariness of"
"the confession before it is admitted in evidence."
"In the instant matter, the learned magistrate has questioned the accused very"
"lengthily with regard to his voluntariness to make the confession and whether"
"there was a person in authority who was trying to influence him to make the"
"confession. Further, the appellant was taken away from police custody and"
"remanded, and the learned Magistrate had given him one day to think it over"
"and come back to court and make the confession. Therefore, even if there was"
"inducement or threat from the police, while he was in the police custody, there"
"would be no threat, when the appellant came from remand and made the"
"statement."
"Thereafter, the magistrate has been careful enough to write down in his own"
"writing, as there was no stenographer available. He had also taken steps to"
