"The next ground of appeal is that the accused had been improperly implicated"
"in the confession and the trial judge has accepted it without proper analysis."
"This we observe to be wholly incorrect because the accused-appellant hadbeen"
"very clearly implicated in the confession and it had been corroborated by the"
"circumstantial evidence played by PW-01, PW-03, police and the doctor. all"
"these portions of evidence have been meticulously analysed by the trial judge."
"This is very clear by Paragraph 2 in page 16 of the judgement, where he had"
"said that the accused-appellant, along with the dead first accused and two"
"others, unknown to the prosecution, had committed this offence on a pre-"
"arranged plan. The murderous intention of the accused-appellant is clearly"
"displayed by the description of the accused-appellant of the incident. In light of"
"the evidence placed by the prosecution, the accused-appellant had made"
"statement from the dock, in which he has not denied the fact that he made a"
"confession to the magistrate, but has gone on to state that he had been"
"tortured  by the police while in remand custody. But the learned trial judge had"
"observed that at the time he had been produced to make a confession, he had"
"not stated anything with regard to the torture he had to undergo in the hands"
"of the police. Therefore, he has rejected the dock statement and had concluded"
"that since the confession had been admitted in evidence, which has explained"
"the culpability of the accused-appellant and those factors had been"
"circumstantially corroborated by PW-01, PW-03, police and the doctor."
"Therefore, we find the conclusion of the trial judge is factually and legally"
"correct. As such, we find that the conviction and sentence entered by the Trial"
"Judge is hereby affirmed."
