"he faced. That is the very reason why he has given answers stating that he cannot"
"remember  certain  things,  and  if  he  has  stated  things  in  the  police  statement,"
"what he said was correct. That does not mean that he was lying before the Court"
"or attempting to narrate a previously concocted story before the Court."
"I do not find a basis to believe that it was the mother of PW-01 who instigated"
"this type of an allegation against the appellant and PW-01 has given evidence at"
"the insistence of his mother."
"There is nothing in the evidence before the trial Court that PW-01’s family or his"
"mother in particular had any animosity towards the appellant. They had been"
"neighbours in their village and had no reason to make a false allegation against"
"him.  The  mother’s  evidence  clearly  shows  that  when  she  was  told  that  the"
"appellant and another person held her son and took him to an abandoned house,"
"the mother being an adult had the ability to suspect what may have happened."
"Her  evidence    shows  that  she  had  been  overwhelmed  by  emotions  and  had"
"promptly taken the child to the police station to lodge a complaint. Although the"
"complaint has been recorded on the following day, the evidence establishes that"
"they have gone to the police on the evening of 05-03-2008, soon after the mother"
"was informed of the incident, but it was the police who had failed to take steps"
"to record a statement promptly. This cannot be attributed as a delay in lodging"
"a complaint under any circumstance."
"Although  the  mother’s  version  as  to  the  manner  in  which  the  appellant  was"
"arrested and the police investigator’s evidence in that regard differs somewhat, I"
"find that it is not a matter that creates a doubt as to the incident per se, and a"
"matter which should not be held against the evidence of the victim child and his"
"mother in that regard."
"I find no basis in the contention that the victim child not telling in his evidence"
"before the Court that he told the doctor who examined him the history regarding"
"the incident as a reason to disregard the evidence as to the history given by the"
"doctor who examined the child when he was admitted to the hospital."
