"","Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal"
"At  the  hearing  of  the  appeal,  the","learned  President’s  Counsel  strenuously"
"contended that the evidence given by the victim child was to the effect that he",""
"did  not  know  the  appellant  and  he  was  a  stranger  to  him  when  this  incident",""
"occurred.",""
"It was his position that the victim child has come to know about the names and",""
"the  identity  of  the  appellant  as  well  the  other  person  because  of  his  mother",""
"revealing their names to him, and also after they were arrested on suspicion.",""
"It  was  his  position  that  such  evidence  does  not  establish  the  identity  of  the",""
"appellant beyond reasonable doubt before the Court.",""
"It was the contention of the learned President’s Counsel that the evidence of PW-",""
"01 was not credible and per se contradictory. It was pointed out that the evidence",""
"of the victim child when he gave evidence before the trial Court had been to the",""
"effect  that  he  met  the  other  person  called  Damith  near  the  road,  and  the",""
"appellant when he entered the abandoned house. However, his statement to the",""
"police had been that he met both of them on the road.",""
"It  was  his  position  that  the  victim  child  has  given  evidence  as  to  the  alleged",""
"perpetrators only at the instigation or under the influence of his mother, and not",""
"by clearly identifying who committed the crime on him. The learned President’s",""
"Counsel submitted that what he termed as an inter se contradiction between the",""
"evidence of the mother of the victim and that of the police officer who conducted",""
"investigations as to how the arrests were made are very much contradictory to",""
"each other.",""
"It was his position that the mother being an interested witness and her evidence",""
"being not rational, such evidence should not have been relied on by the learned",""
"trial  Judge.  It  was  contended  further  that  relying  on  the  history  given  by  the",""
"victim  in  the  judgment  was  also  wrong  since  it  was  not  consistent  with  the",""
"version of events as narrated by PW-01.",""
