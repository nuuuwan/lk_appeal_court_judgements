"However, it is clear from his evidence when taken as a whole, at the time of this"
"incident, he has not known the names  of the appellant and the other person."
"However, it is also clear that the victim knew the appellant and the other person"
"well since they were persons who lived in the neighbourhood."
"The  subsequent  evidence  of  PW-01,  where  he  says  that  he  did  not  know  the"
"appellant,  has  to  be  considered  in  that  context  and  not  in a  manner  to  argue"
"that the evidence of PW-01 had been to the effect that the appellant and the other"
"person were strangers to him. His evidence and that of his mother clearly shows"

"I  am  in  no  position  to  agree  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to"
"consider the question of identity in the correct perspective in his judgment."
"I  find  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  well  analyzed  the  evidence  with"
"regard to the fact whether the PW-01 knew the appellant before the incident and"
"whether he has told the truth about it to the Court. Only after coming to a firm"
