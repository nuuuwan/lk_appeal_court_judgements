"in which bias or prejudice for or against the accused, the witnesses, or"
"the cause which is being tried is eliminated.”"
"The  Appellant  in  his  dock  statement  denied  the  allegation  levelled  against"
"him and took up the position that some unknown persons had entered his"
"house  and  assaulted  the  inmates.    The  Appellant  had  failed  to  put  this"
"position to the prosecution witnesses during the cross examination."
"In  this  case,  the  prosecution  had  led  very  strong  circumstantial  evidence"
"against the Appellant and it is consistent only with the guilt of the Appellant"
"and is totally inconsistent with his innocence. Hence, the grounds raised in"
"the written submission of the Appellant are devoid of any merit."
"As the circumstances established were consistent with the Appellant’s guilt"
"and inconsistence with his innocence, I proceed to dismiss his appeal."
"The appeal is dismissed."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  send  this  judgment  to  the  High"
"Court of Kalutara along with the original case record."
