"more than one year against such a person, the Disciplinary Authority may authorize"
"the payment of salary not exceeding half thereof to the Officer concerned."
"Thus, it is important to take into consideration the provisions of the above section 27:10:2 in"
"which  it  is  stipulated  unambiguously  that  the  disciplinary  authority  may  authorize  the"
"payment of salary not exceeding half thereof to the officer concerned if the delivery of the"
"verdict of the Court takes a period more than one year. The Respondents cannot dispute the"
"fact that a period of more than one year has elapsed from the date of serving the indictment"
"to  the  Petitioner  in  the  said  case  No.  HC  1063/2020.    Hence,  a  duty  is  cast  upon  the"
"disciplinary authority in terms of the said section 27:10:2 to exercise its discretion to consider"
"authorizing a payment of salary not exceeding half thereof to the Petitioner. No material has"
"been made available to the Court as to why the disciplinary authority should not exercise its"
"discretion in favor of the Petitioner allowing payment of half the salary to him."
"It appears that the Petitioner's rights have been affected as the disciplinary authority has not"
"arrived at any conclusion giving due effect to the said section 27:10:2, particularly about the"
"payment of half the salary. It is to be noted that at the time of filing the instant Application,"
"the Petitioner has not been served with the indictment and also the formal disciplinary inquiry"
"against the Petitioner was pending. Furthermore, the PSC  also made its above decision on"
"05.07.2023 after the Petitioner filed the instant Application. Considering the Ouster Clause"
"reflected in Article 61A and the other constitutional provisions regarding the PSC, this Court"
"needs to give careful consideration to the alleged grievances of the Petitioner as he being a"
"public servant does not have many forums to seek redress.  Hence, I take the view that the"
"facts and circumstances of this Case are unique for this Court to make an appropriate order"
"to give due effect to the said section 27:10:2 which deals with the payment of half the salary."
