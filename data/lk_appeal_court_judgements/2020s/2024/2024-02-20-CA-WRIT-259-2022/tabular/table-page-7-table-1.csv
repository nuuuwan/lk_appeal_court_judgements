"incapacitated or disqualified to function as a member. In such an event, the Court should first"
"be  satisfied  that  one  or  more  of  the  sitting  members  of  the  PSC  are  incapacitated  or"
"disqualified to function as members or that they have assumed a jurisdiction that it does not"
"possess. I have arrived at the above conclusion enhancing the jurisprudence in the relevant"
"area of law that was followed by the erudite Judges in the cases cited above."
"The Petitioner of this case is not impugning the appointment of the members of the PSC or"
"taking  up  similar  objections  against  such  members.  The  submissions  of  the  Petitioner  is"
"mainly focused on the authority of the PSC to revisit a decision taken previously by another"
"set of members of the PSC. However, it cannot be assumed that the PSC has exceeded its"
"jurisdiction by revisiting an earlier decision taken by another set of members, as far as the"
"PSC has not acted beyond the purview declared in Article 55 (3) of the Constitution. Thus, I"
"am convinced that the PSC has taken both the above decisions on 14.03.2023 and 05.07.2023"
"with  proper  legal  authority.  In  light  of  the  above,  I  am  of  the  view  that  this  Court  has  no"
"jurisdiction  to  review  the  aforesaid  decisions  of  the  PSC,  made  on  05.07.2023.  The  said"
"decision of the PSC to revisit the earlier decision that was made on 14.03.2023 can be inquired"
"into only by the Supreme Court."
"Having considered the application of the said Ouster Clause, I must henceforth examine what"
"reliefs can be provided to the Petitioner. In regard to this, I need to draw my attention to the"
"legal  provisions  upon  which  the  PSC  has  taken  its  decision  dated  05.07.2023.  It  can  be"
"assumed that the PSC has taken the said decision in terms of section 27:10 of Chapter XLVIII"
"of Volume II of the E-Code. The said section 27:10 reads;"
