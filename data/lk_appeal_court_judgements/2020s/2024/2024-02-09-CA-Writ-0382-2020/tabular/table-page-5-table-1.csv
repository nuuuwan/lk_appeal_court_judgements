"The Petitioner contends that the 6th and 7th Respondents, in their application"
"to the Debt Conciliation Board, did not contest the validity of deed No. 1828"
"('X  4').  It  was  further  argued  that  in  the  application  ('X  1'),  the  6th  and  7th"
"Respondents identified the deed ‘X 4’ as an outright transfer. However, in Part"
"V  of  the  application  to  the  Debt  Conciliation  Board  ('X  1'),  the  6th  and  7th"
"Respondents specifically mentioned deed No. 1828 ('X 4') as the deed in issue."
"Consequently, it is evident that the 6th and 7th Respondents sought relief from"
"the Debt Conciliation Board concerning deed No. 1828 ('X 4'). No relief was"
"sought regarding Mortgage Bond No. 221 ('X 5'), as asserted by the Petitioner."
"Therefore, the Petitioner's claim that the 1st to 5th Respondents, the Chairman,"
"and the Members of the Debt Conciliation Board, awarded reliefs not prayed"
"for  by  the  6th  and  7th  Respondents  lacks  merit.  Additionally,  despite  the"
"Petitioner's assertion that the 6th and 7th Respondents described deed No. 1828"
"('X  4')  as  an  outright  transfer  in  their  application  to  the  Debt  Conciliation"
"Board, it is evident from application 'X 1' that they explicitly characterized it"
"as a conditional transfer."
"The Petitioner contends that the 6th and 7th Respondents lack the locus standi"
"to file an application under Section 17 of the  Debt Conciliation Ordinance."
"This argument is grounded on the assertion that the 6th and 7th Respondents"
"are not debtors of the Petitioner; instead, the 6th Respondent is considered a"
"secured  creditor  of  the  Petitioner  under  Mortgage  Bond  No.  221  ('X  5')."
"Additionally, since the 7th Respondent is not a party to the Mortgage Bond,"
"she,  too,  lacks  the  legal  standing  to  bring  the  application  before  the  Debt"
"Conciliation Board."
"However, it is important to note, as previously stated in this judgment, that the"
"application  by  the  6th  and  7th  Respondents  to  the  Debt  Conciliation  Board"
"('X1')  is  not  based  on  Mortgage  Bond  No.  221  ('X  5')  but  on  conditional"
"transfer No. 1828 ('X 4'), to which the 7th Respondent is a party. Consequently,"
"the Petitioner's submissions on this matter are deemed to be without merit."
"As mentioned earlier in this judgment, even following the execution of deed"
"No.  1828  ('X  4')  on  15th  September,  2006,  the  7th  Respondent  retained"
"possession. On the very same day the transfer deed 1828 was executed, the"
"Petitioner  entered  into  a  lease  agreement with  the  7th  Respondent.  It  is  my"
"opinion  that  the  execution  of  the  lease  agreement  was  a  strategic  move"
"intended to bypass the reality that deed of transfer No. 1828 ('X 4') was, in"
"fact, executed to secure the funds lent to the 7th Respondent."
