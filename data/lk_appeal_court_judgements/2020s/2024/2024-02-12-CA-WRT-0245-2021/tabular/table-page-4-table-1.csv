"No. 03 of 1988 and the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, directing"
"the 1st Respondent to protect the Sinharja forest, directing the Respondents"
"to prepare an updated management plan for Sinharaja National Heritage and"
"Wilderness  area  and 
for  Sinharaja  Forest  Reserve 
in  consultation  with"
"pertinent  stakeholders  and  implementation  of  a  plan  of  action  to  address"
"threats and fill management gaps in conservation and protection of Sinharaja."
"Seeking  an  Order  in  the  nature  of  a  Writ  of  Mandamus  compelling  the"
"Respondents to demarcate the boundaries of the Sinharaja National Heritage"
"and Wilderness area and the Sinharaja Forest Reserve."
"The contention of the Respondents was that there had been a roadway that"
"was in existence for several decades used by the people to travel from Neluwa"
"to  Deniyaya.  The  portion  of  the  said  roadway  which  is  from  Lankagama  to"
"Deniyaya is outside the Sinharaja World Heritage Site and such portion has"
"been  widened  and  renovated.  A  certain  portion  of  the  said  roadway  which"
"traverses through the Sinharaja Heritage Site has been reconstructed without"
"widening  up  the  existing  roadway  which  will  not  cause  any  damage  to  the"
"forest.  There  was  never  a  new  construction  of  a  roadway  through  the"
"Sinharaja World Heritage. In these circumstances, the learned State Counsel"
"has  taken  up  the  position  that  several  reliefs  sought  by  the  Petitioners  are"
"either  granted  or  public  duty  does  not  arise  to  issue  Writs  of  Mandamus"
"against the Respondents and therefore, the matter has now become futile."
"This is a public interest litigation. The contention of the learned State Counsel"
"was that the Respondents had renovated the right of way in dispute which"
"traversed through the Sinharaja Forest without causing any damage to the"
"forest.  These 
facts  are 
to  be  substantiated  with  cogent  and  adequate"
"documentary  evidence.  It  appears  to  this  Court  that  before  supporting  the"
"main matter, tendering a comprehensive objection by the Respondents, and"
"hearing both parties in this regard, this Court is not in a position to come to"
"a  conclusion  that  the  matter  is  futile.  The  learned  State  Counsel  has  not"
"addressed 
the  prayer 
(g)  seeking  a  Writ  of  Mandamus  directing 
the"
"Respondents  to  demarcate  the  boundaries  of  the  said 
forest. 
In  those"
