"Upon 
receiving 
further 
complaints 
regarding 
non-compliance  with 
the"
"regulations concerning the prescribed distances to schools and religious places,"
"the  Commissioner  General  of  Excise  directed  the  license  holder  to  submit  a"
"plan  prepared  by  the  Government  Superintendent  of  Surveys,  illustrating  the"
"linear 
distance 
from 
the 
hotel 
to 
the 
schools 
and 
religious 
places28."
"Subsequently, the license holder appealed to the Minister of Tourism to grant"
"the license without the Government Superintendent of Surveysâ€™ plan29."
"Afterwards, the new owner applied30 to extend the liquor license issued to the"
"8th Respondent, Arugambay Surfers Villa, until the end of 2017. However, the"
"extension was not granted, as the current license holder had placed objections"
"on record31. Subsequently, the Excise  Department requested  a report  from the"
"Divisional  Secretary32  and  the  Police  of  Pottuvil33  to  assess  whether  the  new"
"applicant was a suitable candidate for a license, and both authorities34 provided"
"favorable 
responses.  Following 
this,  Dr.  Kethiswaran  Pillai  once 
again"
"requested the Excise Department to issue the license in his name35. In response,"
"the  Excise  Department  informed  him  that  no  license  would  be  issued  for  the"
"year  2018  due 
to 
the  ongoing  court  proceedings  concerning 
the  premises"
"related to the license36."
"According  to  the  1st  to  7th  Respondents,  following  the  amicable  resolution  of"
"the legal proceedings, the 8th Respondent submitted applications for FL07 and"
"FL08 
licenses37,  which  were 
subsequently 
recommended  by 
the  Deputy"
"Commissioner  of  Excise  (Legal)38.  Thereafter,  the  Commissioner  General  of"
"Excise 
informed 
the  Divisional  Secretary  of  Pottuvil  by 
letter  dated  19th"
