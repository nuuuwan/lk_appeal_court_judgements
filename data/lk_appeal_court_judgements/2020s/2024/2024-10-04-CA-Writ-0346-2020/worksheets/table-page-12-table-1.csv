"The 1st to 7th Respondents state that the 8th Respondent subsequently submitted"
"a sketch; however, no such sketch has been produced in court. In letter ‘1R44,’"
"the 8th Respondent acknowledged the discrepancies between the boundaries in"
"the  application  and  the  title  deed.  Furthermore,  the  8th  Respondent  indicated"
"that the licensed premises would be relocated within the same land to comply"
"with  the  distance  criteria46.  However,  relocating  the  licensed  premises  within"
"the  land  will  not  resolve  the  distance  criteria  as  per  Gazette  ‘1R59’;  it  is  the"
"linear distances from boundary to boundary that must be considered47."
"Additionally, the recommendation from the Assistant Commissioner of Excise"
"(Eastern  Province)48  to  obtain  a  Government  Superintendent  of  Surveys  plan"
"was  not  fulfilled  by  the  8th  Respondent.  The  requirement  for  a  Government"
"Superintendent  of  Surveys  plan  under  Clause  13(h)  of  Gazette  ‘1R59’  cannot"
"be replaced by a sketch. According to the 1st to 7th Respondents, the Divisional"
"Secretary once again indicated that there was public protest to the issuance of"
"the license49; however, no inquiry was conducted as required under Clause 21"
"of the Gazette notification ‘1R59.’ Despite this, the Commissioner General of"
"Excise  authorized  the  Divisional  Secretary,  Pottuvil,  to  issue  the  licenses50."
"Consequently, on 18th June 2020, the FL07 and FL08 licenses were issued for"
"the year 2020, valid until 31st December 2020."
