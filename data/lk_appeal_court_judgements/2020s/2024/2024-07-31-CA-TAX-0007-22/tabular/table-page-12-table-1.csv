"As mentioned hereinbefore the TAC has correctly identified the sources of income of"
"the  Appellant  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  profit.  Even  though  the  right  to"
"entitlement for the economic benefits derived by the SVF Portfolio  has been sold to"
"CLC  Assets  Management  by  the  participation  agreement,  the  Appellant  remains  the"
"legal owner of the SVF Portfolio. Therefore, the lease rentals collected by the Appellant"
"become part and parcel of the profit of the Appellant."
"Hence, the Court is of the opinion the view that the Assessor is correct in attributing"
"the income accrued by the SVF Portfolio to the Appellant and accordingly, the TAC"
"also did not err in affirming the decision of the CGIR on the above matter. The Court"
"answer the third question of law in the negative and in favour of the Respondent."
