"TAC to reconsider them.‚Äù"
"To determine whether the determination of the Respondent and TAC amounts to double"
"taxation, the Appellant should have produced evidence before the Respondent and the"
"burden  of  proof  lies  with  the  Appellant.  This  Court  is  not  supposed  to  consider  the"
"questions of facts but not questions of law. Since the Appellant has failed to raise this"
"matter before the Respondent and produce evidence to establish its position there is no"
"question of law for this Court to consider in terms of TAC Act, and hence I answer the"
"fifth question of law in the negative and in favour of the Respondent."
"For  the  reasons,  enumerated  in  this  judgment,  I  hold  that  the  decision  of  the  Tax"
"Appeals Commission to affirm the determination of the Respondent  and dismiss the"
"appeal is according to law."
