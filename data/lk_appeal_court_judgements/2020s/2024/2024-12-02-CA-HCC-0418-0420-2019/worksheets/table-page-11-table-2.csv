"21. His  Lordship,  Howard  CJ  in  the  case  of  King  vs.  H.  R.  S.  Fernando  48"
"NLR 249 at page 252 has stated,"
"“We have given careful consideration to the question as to whether we should"
"direct a retrial. The offence was alleged to have been committed on December"
"30,  1945.  The  case  for  Crown  rested  on  the  credibility of  Mary  Nona.  The"
"evidence  in  regard  to  this  witness’s  identification  of  robbers  cannot  be"
"regarded as satisfactory. Its assailability will be increased by the passage of"
"time. The chances of a conviction in the event of fresh trial are in our opinion"
"remote. In these circumstances the appeal is allowed and there will be no order"
