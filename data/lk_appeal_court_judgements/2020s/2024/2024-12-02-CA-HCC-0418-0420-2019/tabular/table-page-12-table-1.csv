"22. His  Lordship  Gratiaen  J,  in  the  case  of  P.  M.  Peter  Singho  vs.  M.  B."
"Werapitiya 55 NLR 155 at page 157 has stated,"
"“I have anxiously considered whether I should send the case back for re-trial"
"before  another  Magistrate.  The  charges  against  the  accused  are  of  serious"
"nature  and  it  may  be  that,  upon  the  relevant  and  admissible  evidence,  his"
"conviction would have been justified. But we are here concerned with offences"
"alleged to have been committed over four years ago, and it does not seem to"
"me  just  to  call  upon  him  to  defend  himself  a  second  time  after  such  an"
"unconscionable lapse of time. I, therefore, set aside the conviction and acquit"
"the accused”."
