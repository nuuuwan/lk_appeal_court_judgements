"predecessor Judge who reserved order be nominated to deliver the same."
"The successor Judge has disallowed the application, though, he has not"
"given reasons for doing so."
"16. The predecessor Judge who reserved the aforesaid order had only been"
"transferred  to  another  station  and  nominated  to  sit  in  a  different  High"
"Court, hence the predecessor Judge has continued to function as a High"
"Court Judge. He has not been absent from office due to an illness or any"
"other  inhibition.  The  predecessor  Judge  has  not  been  hindered  from"
"delivering  the  order  reserved  by  him  upon  being  nominated  to  do  so."
"Also, the successor Judge has not been hindered in making the request to"
"the relevant authority to nominate the predecessor Judge to deliver such"
"pending order. Despite the existence of such circumstances, the successor"
"Judge  due  to  unknown  reasons  has  decided  against  making  such  a"
"request."
"17. Further, the successor Judge has erred in concluding that the predecessor"
"Judge has not recorded the demeanor and deportment of PW1 and PW3."
"The Learned Counsel for the appellants has drawn my attention to page"
"1363 of the brief to manifest the instances on which the predecessor Judge"
"has  in  fact  recorded  the  demeanor  and  deportment  of  the  relevant"
"witnesses  led  on  behalf  of  the  prosecution  and  also  to  support  the"
"contention  that  such  fact  was  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  successor"
"Judge in those circumstances."
"18. Such misdirection and omissions by the successor Judge, it is contended"
"has denied a fair trial to the appellants. The Learned Additional Solicitor"
"General,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the  complainant-respondent  has  not"
"disputed  the  contention  of  the  Learned  Counsel  for  the  appellants.  He"
"has admitted that the appellants have been denied a fair trial."
"19. Due to the matters alluded to above, I conclude that there is no necessity"
"to consider the remainder of the grounds of appeal at this moment."
