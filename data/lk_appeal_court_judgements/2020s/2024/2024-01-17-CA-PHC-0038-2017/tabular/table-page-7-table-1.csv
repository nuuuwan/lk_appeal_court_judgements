"However, I am of the view that the matters considered in the above-mentioned"
"case were much different to the appeal  before this Court. In the said case, the"
"application has been dismissed on the basis that the petitioner has sought to set"
"aside a non-existing order, alleged to have been given on a certain date."
"In  the  case  under  consideration,  the  appellant  has  sought  to  set  aside  the"
"judgement  pronounced  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Tangalle  in  an"
"application to challenge the order made by the learned Magistrate of Tangalle,"

"It is settled law that in an inquiry of this nature, the burden of proof is in the"
