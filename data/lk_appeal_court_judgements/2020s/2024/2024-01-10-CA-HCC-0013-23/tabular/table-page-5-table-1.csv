"that  the  entire  incident  took  place  with  the  consent  of  the  victim"
"which is the core of the whole case, and the evidence of the appellant"
"is uncontradicted."
"But 
the  evidence  of 
the  victim 
is  uncorroborated  and 
is  with"
"contradictions and omissions."
"At this point we consider the submissions made by the Counsel for"
"the respondent who said that a mother would not leave a sick child"
"to go and see the paramour. But in the instant matter we find that"
"the mother had not left the child all alone but with the grand parents"
"with  whom 
the  child  had  been 
living  all  along  and  since 
the"
"separation of the parents. Therefore, the victim had not left the child"
"all alone in the house."
"The  charge  submitted  against  the  appellant  is  one  of  rape  and  for"
"which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt  that"
"the consent of the victim was never present during the entirety of the"
"case for the prosecution."
"But 
the  evidence  of 
the  appellant  and 
the  victims  being  not"
"corroborated by any other witness raises a serious doubt with regard"
"to the consent of the victim in the instant case."
"The appellant has taken the same stand of consent right along the"
"case and as such his position is not an afterthought."
"But we find the trial judge had failed to consider the improbabilities"
"in the case for the prosecution but had whole heartedly and blindly"
"believed the evidence of the victim which had denied a fair trial to the"
"appellant."
"Therefore,  we  are  unable  to  agree  with  the  submissions  of  the"
"Counsel for the respondents and we are compelled to conclude that"
"the evidence of the appellant had created a serious doubt in the case"
"for the prosecution."
