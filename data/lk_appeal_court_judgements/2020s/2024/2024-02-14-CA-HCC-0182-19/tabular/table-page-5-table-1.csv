"In the instant case, it is very clearly discussed and considered above that the"
"appellant had been present in the mob which came to the house of Farook and"
"how he had been armed and how he was seen attacking the deceased."
"As  such  we  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  prosecution  has  performed  its  duty  in"
"proving the case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt hence, we see"
"no merit in the instant appeal as such the appeal is dismissed."
