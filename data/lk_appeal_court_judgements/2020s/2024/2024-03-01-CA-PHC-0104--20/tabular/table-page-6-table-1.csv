"The accused in the relevant Magistrate’s Court case has been charged in terms"
"of the Animals Act, and had pleaded guilty to the charge preferred against him."
"The  learned  Counsel  who  represented  the  appellant  when  the  matter  was"
"supported for notice before the Provincial High Court has taken up a position on"
"the  basis  that  the  charge  against  the  accused  in  the  Magistrate’s  Court  was"
"defective  and  the  order  of  the  learned  Magistrate  was  therefore  invalid.  As"
"correctly determined by the learned High Court Judge, I find no basis to agree"
"with such a contention. It is abundantly clear from the charge preferred against"
"the accused in the Magistrate’s Court case that he has been well informed of the"
"fact  that  the  charge  against  him  was  transporting  one  head  of  cattle  in  the"
"relevant  vehicle  without  having  a  valid  permit,  and  thereby  committing  an"
"offence in terms of the Animals Act."
"It appears that the accused had legal representation when he was charged before"
"the Court. Although there may be a defect in the penal provision mentioned in"
"the charge, it is clear that when the accused pleaded guilty, he knew very well"
"what the offence against him was, as the offence was well described. Therefore,"
"I find no basis for the argument that the vehicle inquiry had been held based on"
"a wrong conviction. I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered"
"the  Judgements  of  our  Superior  Courts  in  that  regard  and  overruled  the  said"
"position."
"However,  I  am  of  the  view  that  if  the  order  that  led  to  the  confiscation  of  the"
"vehicle was considered in its correct perspective when the application for notice"
"in relation to the revision application filed before the Provincial High Court was"
"supported for notice, there was good and sufficient basis to issue notice on the"
"respondents and consider the application on its merits."
