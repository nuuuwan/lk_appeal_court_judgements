"owner  was  privy  to  the  offence.  (See  Nizar  vs.  Inspector  of  Police"

"The section 3A itself shows that the obligation of an owner of a vehicle subject"
"to confiscation under this provision is significantly different when compared with"
"the relevant provisions of the Forest Ordinance as well as other statutes which"
"have similar provisions."
"In terms of the proviso of the section 40 (1) of the Forest Ordinance as well as"
"the  decisions  of  our  Superior  Courts  in  relation  to  the  said  provision,  the"
"requirement in terms of the Forest Ordinance in an inquiry held in terms of the"
"proviso  of  section  40  (1)  is  to  show  that  the  owner  had  no  knowledge  of  the"
"offence being committed and he took all precautions to prevent the offence being"
"committed."
"The requirement in terms of the Animals Act is to establish either one of those"
"two requirements where the legislature by its wisdom has enacted the relevant"
"statute in such a manner."
"Therefore, I am of the view that the only guidance that can be taken from the"
"Judgements pronounced by our Superior Courts in terms of the similar provision"
"in  the  Forest  Ordinance  would  be  the  interpretation  given  to  the  words  ‘all"
"precautions to prevent the use’ and apply the same in considering the evidence"
"led in an inquiry in terms of the Animals Act. I am of the view that although the"
"words ‘all precautions’ have been stated in the section, that need not mean that"
"an owner of a vehicle needs to prove all possible precautions, but the precautions"
