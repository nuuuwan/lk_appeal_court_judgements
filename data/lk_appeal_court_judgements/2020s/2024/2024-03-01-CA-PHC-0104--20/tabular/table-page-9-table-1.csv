"that the owner is expected to take under the given facts and the circumstances."
"I am of the view that this has to be considered on a case-by-case basis in relation"
"to the facts and the circumstances relevant to each case and not by applying a"
"strict yardstick in that regard."
"When considering the evidence led at the inquiry before the learned Magistrate"
"of Mt. Lavinia, it was only the registered owner who has given evidence."
"In his evidence he has stated that he purchased the vehicle in question having"
"utilized the money he earned by working overseas. According to him, he has paid"
"Rs. 500,000/- to purchase the vehicle and had obtained a finance facility of Rs."
"1.5 million, where he had been paying an installment of Rs. 55,000/- per month."
"He had stated that he used to park his vehicle in  the Pettah Cross Street and"
"used the vehicle to transport goods from shops situated in the vicinity, and used"
"to earn about Rs. 70,000/- per month in the process."
"He has claimed that on the date of the alleged offence, the vehicle was parked at"
"his  aunt’s  place  in  Dehiwala  area  and  he  came  to  know  that  the  vehicle  was"
"taken  into  custody  for  allegedly  transporting  a  cow.  He  has  admitted  that  the"
"driver  of  the  vehicle  who  was  charged  before  the  Magistrate’s  Court  was  his"
"father,  but  has  stated  that  he  was  not  privy  to  the  offence  committed  by  his"
"father and he has not engaged in any illegal activity. The appellant has claimed"
"the vehicle on that basis."
"It  is  clear  from  his  evidence-in-chief  that,  apart  from  stating  the  fact  that  he"
"never  engaged  in  any  illegal  activities,  he  has  not  stated  that  he  took  all"
"reasonable precautions to prevent the offence being committed."
"However, he has been specific that he had no knowledge of the offence. Under"
"cross-examination, he has explained that he too lives near the house where his"
"father is living with his family, and had stated that the father used to take the"
"vehicle with his permissions. He has claimed that on the date of the incident, he"
"only came to know only after the detention of the vehicle by the police that the"
"father has taken the vehicle, which was parked at his aunt’s place."
