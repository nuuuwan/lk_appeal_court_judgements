"relevant portion of the judgment is re-produced below:","",""
"","According to the law of Evidence, as of right it would not be possible for a",""
"","party to a criminal or civil case to present a physical object as an item of",""
"","evidence, on its own standing. This is because it would not come within",""
"","any  one  of  the  four  categories  of  ‘evidence’  also  referred  to  as  ‘judicial",""
"","evidence,’  recognized  by  the  law  of  Evidence,  namely  ‘oral  evidence,’",""
"","‘documentary  evidence,’  ‘contemporaneous  audio-visual  recordings’  and",""
"‘computer  evidence.’  The","latter","two  categories  of  evidence,  namely"
"‘contemporaneous  audio-visual","recordings’  and 
‘computer","evidence’"
"gained  recognition","in 
the  eyes  of 
the 
law  by 
the  Evidence","(Special"
"Provisions) 
Act,","No. 
14 
of 
1995.  What 
is","contemplated 
by"
"‘contemporaneous","audio-visual 
recordings’ 
are 
recordings","of 
the"
"","occurrence  of  the  facts  in  issue  or  relevant  facts  embedded  in  certain",""
"","media, and they can take the form of audio recordings, video recordings,",""
"","audio-visual or video recordings, and still photographs. Section 60 of the",""
"","Evidence Ordinance  which provides  that  oral evidence must  in  all cases",""
"","whatsoever, be direct, provides further, in its second proviso that,” if oral",""
"","evidence  refers  to  the  existence  or  condition  of  any  material  thing  other",""
"","than a document, the court may, if it thinks fit, require the production of",""
"","such  material  thing  for  its  inspection”.  (Emphasis  added.)  Such  material",""
"","things when produced at a trial are referred to as real evidence. Thus, it",""
"","would be seen that the law of Evidence has not completely precluded the",""
"","presentation of physical material as evidence. Therefore, the sequence to",""
"","be followed in the presentation of a physical object as real evidence would",""
"","be,  first,  to  present  oral  evidence  regarding  the  existence  or  condition  of",""
"such  a  physical  object,  and","thereafter,  secondly, 
invite","the  Court 
to"
"","consider permitting the production of such physical object for inspection.",""
"","What  is  important  to  note  is  that  in  terms  of  section  60  of  the  Evidence",""
