"to PW19 at 23:45 hours."
"Thereafter,  PW8  was  called  to  give  evidence  to  corroborate the  evidence  of"

"The burden of proof usually  lies upon the person who brings a claim in a"
"dispute. 
It 
is  often  associated  with  the  Latin maxim semper  necessitas"
"probandi incumbit ei qui agit, a translation of which is: ""the necessity of proof"
"always lies with the person who lays charges."" Hence an accused person has"
"no burden to prove his case except where he pleads a general or a special"
"exception in the Penal Code, where he will then be required to bring evidence"
"to prove the defence."
"Therefore, a person can only be convicted based on cogent and unambiguous"
"evidence as that 'presumption of innocence' is the hallmark and glory of our"
"system of criminal justice."
"Further,  in  a  drug  related  prosecution,  the  evidence  adduced  by  both  the"
"prosecution  and  the  defence  should  be  considered  very  carefully  to  avoid"
"anybody 
taking  undue 
advantage.  Establishment 
of  high  degree 
of"
"probability is an indispensable requirement in all drug related prosecutions."
"Probability holds a very important role when it comes to convincing the judge"
"on a specific point as more probable one of the two or more possibilities are,"
"where  then  there  will  be  a  better  chance  for  the  judge  to  get  convinced."
"Probability is of utmost importance during criminal investigation and is used"
"to  assess 
the 
significance  of 
various 
types  of 
evidence.  To  accuse"
"someone “beyond 
reasonable  doubt” it  becomes  quintessential 
to  have"
"strong evidence and for the sake of that one has to make few assumptions"
"to reach certain conclusions, the possibility of these assumptions to be true"
"is specifically know as principle of probability in legal terms."
