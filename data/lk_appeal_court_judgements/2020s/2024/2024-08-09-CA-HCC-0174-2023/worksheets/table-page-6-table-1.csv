"CA/HCC/174/23"
"As the appeal grounds raised by the Appellant are inter-related, the grounds"
"will be considered together in this case."
"In this case, police officers had conducted the raid upon an information that"
"the  Appellant  was  expected  at  Maliban  Junction,  Ratmalana.  They  set  off"
"from the STF Head Quarters and reached Ratmalana in a car and a cab. A"
"person was arrested there and when they were returning via Attidiya Road,"
"the  informant  had  given  second  information  to  PW8  that  the  Appellant  is"
"enroute to Kaduwela in a three-wheeler bearing No. WP YU-372. Hence the"
"team  proceeded  to  Kaduwela.  Although  they  had  waited  at  Kaduwela  till"
"15:30  hours,  the  three-wheeler  did  not  turn  up.  At  that  time  PW8  had"
"received  third  information  that  the  Appellant  is  expected  near  Millenium"
"Food Centre on the Maharagama-Piliyandala Road. The Cab was stationed"
"near YMCA Maharagama and PW1 and P8 had proceeded in a car with three"
"other officers to Millenium Food City. According to PW1 they had arrived at"
"the Millenium Food Centre at 17:25 hours while PW8 had stated that they"
"arrived at 14:00 hours. PW1 further contradicted his own evidence saying"
"that  they  reached  Millenium  Food  Centre  at  16:00  pm.  The  contradictory"
"evidence  regarding  arrival  time  is  given  much  significance  in  this  case,  as"
"the informer had given three pieces of information. As such the contradictory"
"evidence given by PW1 and PW8 regarding the arrival time certainly affects"
"the probability of events which had been heavily relied on by the prosecution."
"According  to  PW1  first  they  had  gone  to  Maliban  Junction  in  Ratmalana."
"From  there  the  police  party  had  gone  to  Kaduwela  and  finally  they  had"
"arrived at Maharagama. As per the ODO meter of the Cab, it had run 112"
"Km for the entire operation. Considering the distance between Bauddhaloka"
"Mawatha to Maliban Junction, Maliban Junction to Kaduwela, Kaduwela to"
"Maharagama  and  then  from  Maharagama  to  Police  Narcotics  Bureau,  the"
"distances  covered  by  the  cab  is  excessive.  No  plausible  explanation  was"
"adduced by the prosecution to iron out the excessive mileage. This too raises"
