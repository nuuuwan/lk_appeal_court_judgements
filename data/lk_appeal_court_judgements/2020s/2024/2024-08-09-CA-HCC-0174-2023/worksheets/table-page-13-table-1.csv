"was discharged, Learned High Court Judge had used the recovery evidence"

"As correctly argued by the Defence Counsel, this has caused great prejudice"
"to the Appellant and he was not afforded a fair trial."
"In 
this  case 
the  raid  was  conducted  upon  receiving 
three  pieces  of"
"information.  Further,  the  arrest  and  recovery  of  productions  has  failed  to"
"pass the probability test in this case mainly due to the existence of glaring"
"inconsistencies  between  evidence  given  by  PW1  and  PW8  and  non-"
"production of the real evidence which was vital to the case. Had the Learned"
"Trial Judge looked into the evidence presented in its correct perspective, he"
"should have accepted the evidence given by the Appellant."
"Further,  the  Appellant  had  not  afforded  a  fair  trial  as  guaranteed  in  the"
"Constitution."
"Guided  by  the  above  cited  judicial  decisions,  I  conclude  that  the  appeal"
"grounds  advanced  by 
the  Appellant  have  very  serious 
impact  on 
the"
"prosecution case."
