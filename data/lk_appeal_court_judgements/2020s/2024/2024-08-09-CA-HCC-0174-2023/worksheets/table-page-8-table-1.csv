"“Oral evidence must, in all cases whatever, be direct; that is to say–"
"(1)  If  it  refers  to  a  fact  which  could  be  seen  it  must  be  the"
"evidence of a witness who says he saw that fact;"
"(2)  If  it  refers  to  a  fact  which  could  be  heard,  it  must  be  the"
"evidence of a witness who says he heard that fact;"
"(3)  If  it  refers  to  a  fact  which  could  be  perceived  by  any  other"
"sense  or  in  any  other  manner,  it  must  be  the  evidence  of  a"
"witness who says he perceived that fact by that sense or in that"
"manner;"
"(4)  If  it  refers  to  an  opinion  or  to  the  grounds  on  which  that"
"opinion is held, it must be the evidence of the person who holds"
