"CA/HCC/174/23"
"According to PW1 the purpose for which the Appellant came to the boutique"
"was to handover heroin to a nearby boutique. But PW8 in his evidence stated"
"that according to the informer, the purpose for his arrival was to weigh the"
"Heroin from a retail shop."
"According  to  the  evidence  of  PW1  and  PW8,  once  the  three-wheeler  was"
"stopped in front of the car in which the STF Officers were waiting, PW8 had"
"given a call to the informant. Thereafter two STF Officers in civil attire had"
"been  sent  to  approach  the  three-wheeler  driver.  Thereafter  only  PW1  had"
"gone near the three-wheeler. It is in evidence that the two STF Officers who"
"were sent near the three-wheeler were asked to behave as normal people and"
"the Appellant was not blocked by anybody, enabling him to get down from"
"the three-wheeler and to proceed to the boutique. Hence the Counsel for the"
"Appellant contended that it is highly improbable to believe that the Appellant"
"remained  inside  the  three-wheeler  without  even  getting  down  till  all  steps"
"were taken by PW1."
"The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed by the"
"prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding."
