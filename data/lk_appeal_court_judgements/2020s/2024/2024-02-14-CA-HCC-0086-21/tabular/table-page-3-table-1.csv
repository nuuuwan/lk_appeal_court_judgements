"imprisonment. It has been ordered that the default sentences should be served"
"consecutively."
"The Grounds of Appeal"
"At the hearing of this Appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated"
"the following two grounds of appeal for the consideration of Court."
"1.  The date of the offence and the place of offence has not been proved by"
"the prosecution."
"2.  The prosecution has failed to adduce any evidence to establish that the"
"accused was present on the alleged date and place of the offence."
"Facts in Brief"
"Since the grounds of appeal are in relation to the date and the place of offence, I"
"will now summarize the evidence led before the Court in that regard."
"PW-01, who was the victim child, had been a 12-year-old at the time relevant to"
"this incident. The evidence led before the Court clearly establishes the fact that"
"although he was 18 years of age at the time he gave evidence, he was a person"
"who  has  studied  only  up  to  grade  3  and  a  person  who  is  unable  to  read  and"
"write. It appears that the learned High Court Judge has taken note of this fact,"
"and  before  allowing  the  prosecution  to  lead  evidence  of  PW-01  had  satisfied"
"himself by posing several questions to PW-01 as to whether he is a person who"
"can  give  evidence  before  the  Court,  could  understand  the  proceedings  and"
"whether the Court can rely on his evidence, despite him being almost an illiterate"
"person."
"Having satisfied on the above facts, the learned High Court Judge has allowed"
"the prosecution to lead his evidence. It is clear from his evidence that he was"
"unable  to  remember  the  date  upon  which  he  faced  the  grave  sexual  abuse"
"incident."
