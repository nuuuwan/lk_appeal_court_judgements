"At the conclusion of the trial, when the learned High Court Judge decided to call"
"for a defence from the appellant, he has made a dock statement and had only"
"stated that he has done nothing wrong to PW-01 and because of that to discharge"
"him from the case."
"It  appears  from  the  line  of  cross-examination  of  the  witnesses  including  the"
"victim that the stand taken by the appellant had been a mere denial. It has been"
"suggested  to  the  victim  that  when  the  complaint  was  made  in  relation  to  the"
"other incident, PW-01 failed to mention anything about the incident relating to"
"the  indictment  because  no  such  incident  happened.  However,  the  victim  had"
"denied that position and stated that such an incident occurred as stated by him"
"in his evidence."
