"Furthermore,  refusal  to  consider  a  party's  case  has  to  be  distinguished"
"from refusal to accept the party's argument. As Lord Goddard CJ said:"
"to  allow  an  order  of  mandamus  to  go  there  must  be  a  refusal  to"
"exercise the jurisdiction. The line may be a very fine one between"
"a wrong decision and a declining to exercise jurisdiction; that"
"is  to  say,  between  finding  that  a  litigant  has  not  made  out  a"
"case, and refusing to consider whether there is a case."
