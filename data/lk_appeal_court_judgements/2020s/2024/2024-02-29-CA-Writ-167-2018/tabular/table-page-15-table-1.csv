"But, if not for coffee, tea or any other cultivation, the land in the ownership of"
"the state does not produce wealth. It lies barren. The subsequent legislation such"
"as Land Development Ordinance of 1935 having recognized this truth introduced"
"provisions  to  grant  temporary  permits  to  “unauthorized”  users.  Under  the"
"Ordinance there is an excellent scheme to encourage such users to cultivate and"
"to make land productive of wealth which culminates in the Crown grant."
"P.02, the circular dated 15.06.1995 regularizes “unauthorized” occupation prior"
"to 15.06.1995, which is an arbitrarily set and hence unreasonably decided date."
"But that is not the question in this case. The petitioner has established that she"
"has been cultivating since 1980s. If she is not granted the permit under the law,"
"then, that inaction could be remedied by mandamus issued by this Court."
