"I  am  of  the  view  that  none  of  the  conditional  orders  made  by  the  learned"
"Additional Magistrate are orders made with clarity which can be implemented. It"
"is  imperative  on  a  Magistrate  when  making  conditional  orders  to  identify  the"
"place  or  the  structure  or  the  issue  where  the  nuisance  should  be  prevented."
"When  making  such  an  order,  a  Magistrate  needs  to  consider  all  the  relevant"
"factors  and  consider  where  the  balance  of  convenience  lie.  There  should  be  a"
"time limit fixed by such an order as well."
"I am unable to find any of the basic matters that should be stated in an order of"
"this  nature  has  been  mentioned  by  the  learned  Additional  Magistrate,  so  that"
"the conditional order can be carried out."
"After  making  the  above  two  orders,  it  appears  that  the  learned  Additional"
"Magistrate has carried out an inspection of the place where the alleged nuisance"
"is taking place. There had been a public disturbance at the inspection as several"
"persons have come forward claiming that if the drainage system is closed, they"
"will be affected as a result."
"Several  other  parties  have  intervened  to  the  case  after  the  inspection.  The"
"petitioner  has  also  intervened  in  the  matter  as  the  party  responsible  for  the"
"construction  of  the  drainage  system  and  maintenance  of  the  roads  within  the"
"Western Provincial Council area."
"After  having  considered  the  submissions  made  by  the  intervening  parties,  the"
"learned Additional Magistrate, on 02-08-2023, has made the following order."
