"Interpreting the term, the ‘balance of probability’ Lord Denning, in the case of"
"Miller Vs. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 AER 372, observed that:"
"“If  the  evidence  is  such  the  tribunal  can  say  we  think  it  more  probable"
"than not the burden is discharged.”"
"At this juncture, I would like to reproduce the judgement cited by the learned"
"Counsel 
for  the  appellant,  pronounced 
in  the  Court  of  Appeal  by  A.W.A."
"Salam, J. in Case No. CA/PHC/108/2010 dated 26-08-2014, which refers to"
"the mode of proof that is required in an inquiry under the Forest Ordinance:"
"“Even  assuming  that  the  owner  of  the  vehicle  was  under  a  duty  to  show"
"cause  against  a  possible  order  of  confiscation,  I  find  it  difficult  to  accept"
"the  basis  on  which 
the 
learned  Magistrate  has  entered  an  order 
for"
"confiscation on the merits of the inquiry. It was the evidence of the owner"
"that  he  had  given  instructions  to  the  employee  (driver)  not  to  engage  the"
"lorry  for  any  other  purpose  other  than  to  transport  items  which  do  not"
"require  a  permit.  The  testimony  of  the  owner  has  not  been  discredited"
"under  cross-examination.  There  has  been  no  previous  instance  where  the"
"driver has been charged for similar offences."
"When  someone  is  under  a  duty  to  show  cause  that  he  has  taken  all"
"precautions against the commission of similar offences, I do not think that"
"he  can  practically  do  many  things  than  to  give  specific  instructions.  The"
"owner  of  the  lorry  cannot  be  seated  all  the  time  in  the  lorry  to  closely"
"supervise for what purpose the lorry is used. In an order of confiscation of"
"the vehicle, then however much the owner comes forward and says that he"
"gave  instructions  not  to  make  use  of  the  vehicle  for  illegal  purposes,  by"
"reason of the fact that he is on the monthly payment, the vehicle has to be"
"confiscated.  This  approach  does  not  appear 
to  be 
reasonable  and"
"acceptable  in  law.  In  an  inquiry  of  this  nature,  what  the  owner  has  to"
