"hawk-eye on the daughter and sending the daughter for extra classes in order to prevent the"
"daughter from being at home."
"PW 2 has further testified that the appellant would undress the daughter in her presence and"
"it was the evidence of the said witness that she had tried to advise the appellant as she was"
"a “Daham Pasal” teacher and the appellant had denied the acts but it was the evidence of the"
"said witness that the appellant had got caught in the act."
"This witness has admitted the fact that the police complaint was made only in the year 2007"
"when the daughter was 15 years of age and the witness had admitted that 1 1/2 years prior"
"to  lodging  the  complaint  she  had  been  aware  of  the  sexual  abuse  that  the  daughter  was"
"subjected to at the hands of the appellant which prompted the Court to question her to the"
"effect ""මේ අවුරුදු එක හමාර මහත්තයාට විරුද්ධව කිසිවක් කරන්මන් නැතුව ඉවසමෙන හිටියා දරුවට"
"ඕන මගුලක් මවච්චාමව කියලා.""."
"The witness in the answer has testified that she was hell-bent on settling the issue amicably"
"and preserving the marriage as the three children need a father and she wanted a husband"
"and also wanted to safeguard her profession. Witness further testified that another reason"
"which prevented her from complaining to the police was that the appellant was her first love"
"and they had kindled their love affair during the time, she was doing her Advanced Level Exam"
"and the relationship culminated in marriage. The appellant was overly suspicious of her and"
"explained the circumstances which prompted her to make a police complaint. Witness PW 2"
"has testified that the appellant had locked her up in a room and had assaulted her with a stick"
"and when she went to make a complaint in that regard, she had lodged a complaint in relation"
"to the sexual abuse committed to her daughter by the appellant."
"This witness further explaining the failure to make a prompt complaint has testified that since"
"the appellant had threatened her and her daughter, they refrained from going to the police."
"Witness reiterated that she had seen the appellant abusing the daughter and that she had"
"been  informed  of  the  disgraceful  acts  of  sexual  abuse  committed  on  the  daughter  by  the"
"appellant. In cross-examination, the witness has admitted that on 05.08.2007, the appellant"
"had  come  in  search  of  her  at  her  school  and  that  there  had  been  a  dispute  between  the"
"appellant and the witness over the latter coming home late and that she had been assaulted"
"which prompted her to inform her sister."
"It was her evidence that they had complained the following day with regard to the assault."
"Witness has further admitted that the daughter had accompanied her to the police station"
"and on the same day she lodged a complaint relating to the sexual abuse committed on the"
"daughter by the appellant. It was the evidence of the said witness that all five family members"
"sleep in one room on two beds and on one occasion, she had seen the appellant putting his"
"hand under the mosquito net and abusing the daughter but it was her evidence that she had"
"pretended to be asleep."
"PW 2 has admitted the fact that the appellant who was unduly suspicious of her had advised"
"her with regard to her conduct. It warrants mentioning that it was suggested to the witness"
"that due to the assault on her by the appellant over illicit affairs she was having, the witness"
"had falsely implicated the appellant which suggestions were denied by the witness."
