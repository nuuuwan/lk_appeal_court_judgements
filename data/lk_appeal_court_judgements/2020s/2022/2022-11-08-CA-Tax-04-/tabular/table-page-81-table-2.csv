"v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra), we took a similar view in"
"paragraph 94:"
"“[94] There is nothing in section 33 (2) to indicate that the assessor shall indicate"
"his opinion in specific language and in a specific manner in writing. The formation"
"of assessor’s opinion can be gathered from the language used in any notice or"
"any intimation letter sent by him to the taxpayer supported by the contents of the"
"record maintained by the Respondent”."
