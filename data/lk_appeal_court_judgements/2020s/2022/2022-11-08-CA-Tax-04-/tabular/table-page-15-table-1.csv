"is engaged in the manufacturing activity of making of an article. His contention was"
"such  activity  shall  relate  to  the  assembling  or  joining  of  an  article  by  whatever"
"process  adapting  for  sale  any  article,  packaging,  bottling,  putting  into  boxes,"
"cutting, cleaning, polishing, labelling or in any other way preparing an article for"
"sale other than in a wholesale or retail activity."
"[43]  Dr.  Kanag-Isvaran  submitted  that  no  part  of  the  agreement  entered  into"
"between RMCC/PSL with the Appellant indicates that the Appellant is undertaking"
"a manufacturing function, and the manufacturing function is undertaken by RMCC"
"and PSL. His submission was that the Appellant has not in any way participated or"
"engaged in any of the activities referred to, under the definition “manufacture” in"
"section 83 of the VAT Act. He submitted that RMCC and PSL who run their own"
"business in their own facilities and purchase their raw material and manufactured"
"the products in question with their own labor and own expertise. He contended"
"that 
in  the  present  case,  RMCC  and  PSL  are  physically  engaged 
in  contract"
"manufacturing  activities,  and  manufactured  products  on 
their  own  and 
the"
"Appellant has merely purchased goods manufactured by contract manufacturers."
"[44]  Dr.  Kanag-Isvaran’s 
submission  was 
that 
the  Appellant  only  provided"
"specifications,  moulds  and  colours  or  ingredients  to  be  added  on,  in  order  to"
"differentiate the shape of the products which are the usual practices in any field of"
"business.  Dr.  Kanag-Isvaran  however,  argued 
that  such  practices  cannot  be"
"construed to classify the Appellant as the manufacturer. He further submitted that"
"RMCC and PSL are contract manufacturers, and a contract manufacturer is in law"
"regarded  as  the  manufacturer.  His  contention  was  that  in  the  absence  of  any"
"statutory provision, the concept of a deemed manufacturer cannot be applied in"
"respect of the supply of goods."
"[45]  His  second  argument  was  that  the  Appellant  has  paid  VAT  on  the  supplies"
"made by the contract manufacturers but the Appellant did not claim an input credit"
"in respect of such purchases or charged VAT for persons to whom it had sold these"
"goods  since 
it 
is  only  engaged 
in  the  activity  of  buying 
from  the  contract"
"manufacturers. He contended that the Appellant has not claimed input tax credit"
"in respect of such purchases and thus, it has not charged VAT for persons to whom"
"it has sold goods.  He further submitted that RMCC and PSL are registered with the"
"Inland Revenue Department as manufacturers for VAT purposes, and issued VAT"
"invoices  in  respect  of  the  present  transaction  indicating  that  they  have  made"
"supplies of goods. His third argument was that the Appellant is only engaged in"
"buying and selling products manufactured by the RMCC and PSL, and therefore,"
