"“The  mere  omission  of  any  income  from  the  return  does  not  constitute  the"
"offence. The omission may be due to an oversight or it may even be deliberate,"
"but not willfully with intent to evade tax. A taxpayer is entitled to construe the"
"taxing statute and make his return  in accordance with the understanding of it."
"An  omission  based  on  a  mistaken  view  of  the  law  or  facts  does  not  attract"
"punishment. The taxing authorities are not bound by the taxpayer’s  views of the"
"law or by his methods of accounting. They are free to reject his interpretation"
"and assess him on what they think is the correct basis.... to attract punishment,"
"the omission must be done deliberately and with the evil intention of defeating"
"unlawfully the object of the statute by knowingly presenting a false picture of the"
"income of the person making the return by omitting therefrom material which"
"the tax payer knowns should be properly be there....."
"The false statement or entry must be deliberately made with the knowledge that"
"it is false and with the evil intention of thereby misleading the taxing officer. The"
"object  of  the  false  statement  or  entry  should  be  to  defeat  the  purpose  of  the"
"statute, to deny to the revenue its legitimate dues. A statement of entry which"
"is in fact false if made inadvertently or honestly in the belief that it is true"
"does not attract punishment, even if the taxpayer stood by the statement"
"or entry if passed undetected” (emphasis added)"
