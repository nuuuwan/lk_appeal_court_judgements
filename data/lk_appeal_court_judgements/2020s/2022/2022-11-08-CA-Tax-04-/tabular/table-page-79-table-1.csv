"intended to evade tax. It was further held that for an accused to be guilty, it must"
"be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt that the real intention"
"is to evade tax as opposed to a constructive one."
"[258]  The  learned  Senior  Additional  Solicitor  General  however,  argued  that  the"
"Respondent is not required by section 33(2) to prove that the Appellant’s failure"
"to make a full and true disclosure of all the material facts necessary to determine"
"the amount of tax payable by him was done with the evil intention of misleading"
"the Assessor. She argued that where it can be shown that there were reasonable"
"grounds for the Assessor to form an opinion from the available materials that the"
"Appellant  has  failed  to  make  a  full  and  true  disclosure  of  all  the  material  facts"
"necessary to determine the amount of tax payable by him, the Appellant cannot"
"be freed from its tax liability under the VAT Act."
"[259]  Section  33(2)  is  not  a  penal  provision  that  imposes  a  punishment  for"
"committing  a  criminal  offence  willfully  with  intent  to  evade  or  assist  any  other"
"person to evade tax, like in Chellappah v. Commissioner of Income Tax (supra) or"
"Piyadasa v. Vaz (supra).  In my view, section 33(2) of the VAT Act only empowers"
"the Assessor to assess the taxpayer beyond the three year period for the making"
"of  the  assessment  where  he  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  taxpayer  has  willfully  or"
"fraudulently  failed  to  make  a  full  and  true  disclosure  of  all  the  material  facts"
"necessary to determine the amount of tax. There is no additional burden  on the"
"Assessor to prove intentional tax fraud or intentional tax evasion before making"
"an assessment in the extended time period specified in section 33(2)."
"[260]  It  is  relevant  to  note  that  section  33(2)  refers  to  the  elements  of  either"
"“willfully” or “fraudulently;” and not “willfully and fraudulently” and thus, there is"
"no need for the Assessor to prove fraud in all situations, and it is sufficient for the"
"Assessor to form an opinion that the taxpayer has willfully failed to make a full and"
"true disclosure of all the material facts necessary to determine the amount of tax"
"payable by him."
"[261]  In  HSBS  Electronic  Data  Processing  Lanka  (Pvt)  Ltd  v.  The  Commissioner"
"General  of  Inland  Revenue    (supra),    Janak  Silva  J.,  relying  on  the  interpretation"
"given by Basnayaka J. (as he was then) held that the VAT Act, being a fiscal rather"
"than a penal statute, the word “willfully” in section 33 (2) means deliberately or"
"purposely without reference to bona fides. In this context, we  have to look at the"
"applicability of Section 33 (2) of the VAT Act. I must emphasize that Section 33 (2)"
"requires  the  assessor  to  form  an  opinion  that  the  taxpayer  has  willfully  or"
