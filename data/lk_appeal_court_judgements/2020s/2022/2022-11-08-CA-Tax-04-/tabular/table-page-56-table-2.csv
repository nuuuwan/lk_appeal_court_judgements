"the following reasons:"
"1.  The time bar to issue an assessment in respect of the taxable periods January"
"2006-August 2006 lapsed in August 2009 i.e., prior to the receipt of the letter"
"of intimation and the notice of assessment. Each of the assessments made for"
"the  periods,  January  to  July  2006  have  been  made  after  the  expiry  of  the"
"relevant statutory period for making an assessment in terms of section 33 (1)"
"of the VAT Act and accordingly, such assessment is of no force or avail in law."
"The  Appellant  relied  on  section  33  (1)  of  the  VAT,  which  provides  that  the"
"assessment or additional assessment shall be made within 3 years from the"
"end of the taxable period in respect of which the return is furnished or the"
"assessment was made as the case may be."
"2.  No valid assessment can be made in compliance with section 33 of the VAT"
"Act without serving the notice of assessment on the taxpayer and therefore,"
"an unserved notice of to the taxpayer within the time bar period for making"
"of an assessment is not valid;"
"3.  Though the notice of assessment must be served on the taxpayer prior to the"
"expiry  of  the  statutory  time  bar  period  for  making  the  assessment,  in  the"
"present case, each of the assessments has been served on the Appellant after"
"the expiry of the time bar period i.e.,11.09.2009. Accordingly, such assessment"
"is  also  of  no  force  or  avail  in  law.  The  Appellant  referring  to  the  notice  of"
"assessment  has  taken  up  the  position  that  the  notice  of  assessment  dated"
"17.08.2009 was received by the Appellant on 11.09.2009."
