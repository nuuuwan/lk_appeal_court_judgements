"agreement’s  points  to  the  taxable  supply  of  goods  by  the  Appellant  and  the"
"provision of manufacturing services by RMCC and PSL for and on behalf of the"
"Appellant,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the  substance  of  the  agreements  and  the"
"activities performed by the parties in the entire manufacturing process."
"[90] The VAT Act provides that “supply of services” means any supply which is not"
"a supply of goods, but includes any loss incurred in a taxable activity for which an"
"indemnity  is  due.  In  Robinson  v.  Graves  (1935)  1  KB  579),  in  distinguishing  a"
"contract for service (work and labour) from a sale of goods, Acton J. stated that"
"where the substance of the contract was that skill and labour should be exercised"
"upon the production of the portrait, and it was only ancillary to that contract that"
"there  would  pass  from  the  artist  to  his  customer  some  materials.  As  those"
"materials were the paint and the canvas, the contract was considered to be one of"
"service (work and labour)."

"v. Graves (supra) at p. 588:"
