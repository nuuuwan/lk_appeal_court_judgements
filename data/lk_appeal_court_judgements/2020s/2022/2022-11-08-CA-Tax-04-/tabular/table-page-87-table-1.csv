"[280] It is absolutely clear that the material documents including the activity wise"
"breakups  for  VAT  declared,  representing  liable  and  exempt  activities  for  the"
"determination  of  the  VAT  liability  were  in  the  custody  of  the  Appellant  but  the"
"record does not indicate that they were not disclosed to the Assessor.  It is clear"
"from the record that the Assessor had no evidence of facts sufficient to make an"
"early assessment as all the necessary information and all relevant documents had"
"not been disclosed to the Assessor in time to make the assessment in time."
"[281] In my view that Assessor had reason to form an opinion first that the full"
"supplies had not been truly declared and been under-assessed by the Appellant"
"in its returns. The second is that the Assessor had reason to form an opinion that"
"such under-assessment has occurred by reason of the willful (deliberate, voluntary"
"and purposeful)  failure on the part of the Appellant to disclose fully and truly all"
"material facts (supplies) necessary to determine the amount of the tax payable by"
"the  Appellant.  Both  these  conditions  had  been  satisfied  and  therefore,  the"
"Assessor was entitled to make the assessments beyond the period of three years,"
"but within the period of five years from the end of the taxable periods in respect"
"of which the return is furnished."
"[282]  In my view, the taxpayer cannot invoke the time bar objection against his"
"own willful, deliberate and voluntary act of failing to submit all the material facts,"
"i.e. all supplies in time, necessary to determine the amount of tax payable by him,"
"in violation of his statutory obligation imposed by the VAT Act. In the result, the"
"assessor  was  justified  in  invoking  Section  33  (2)  of  the  VAT  Act  in  making  an"
"assessment for the relevant periods. For those reasons, I hold that the assessments"
"made for the periods from January 2006 to July 2006 are not time-barred."
"Questions of law Nos: 4 & 5"
"Is the determination of the TAC against the weight of evidence?"
"In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, did the TAC err in law when it"
"came to the conclusion it did?"
"[283] For those reasons, In my view, the TAC has properly examined and evaluated"
"the relevant evidence, applied the relevant legal principles and come to the correct"
"conclusion in confirming the determination made by the Respondent."
