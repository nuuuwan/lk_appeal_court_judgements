"rights and obligations and the surrounding circumstances as a whole, whether"
"the  Appellant,  can  be  properly  characterised  as  a  “travel  agent”  or  a  mere"
"“handling agent”."
"[80] In the context, it is the substance of the contract document as a whole has to"
"be taken into consideration, and not merely the form in which a word is used, as"
"there  may  be  different 
types  of  contracts 
that  may  closely 
resemble 
the"
"commercial contracts such as in the present case."
"Different types of manufacturing arrangements"
"[81]  Apart 
from 
the  dispute  at  hand, 
the  question  which  arises 
for  our"
"consideration is whether in substance, the said contract was a contract for buying"
"and  selling  or  a  contract  for  a  supply  of  goods  or  services,  or  a  contract  for"
"manufacture and supply, or a contract for mere work and labour."

"finished  and  intermediate  product  or  finished  product,  and  different  types  of"
"services including supply of goods ancillary to services in the supply chain."
"[83]  As  various  outsourcing  activities  in  the  manufacturing  industry  can  take"

"having  regard  to  the  obligations  and  activities  intended  by  the  parties  to  be"
"performed in a commercial agreement."
"[84] The Appellant submits that the substance of the agreements with RMCC and"
