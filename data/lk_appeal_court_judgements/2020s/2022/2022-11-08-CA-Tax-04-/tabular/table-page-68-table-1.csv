"[219] In both cases, Samarakoon, J. held that no valid assessment can be made"
"until notice of assessment is sent to the taxpayer or no lawfully valid assessment"
"can be made without first serving a notice of assessment on the taxpayer unless"
"the Assessor could have maintained a book or register in which an assessment is"
"entered. Accordingly, in the absence of such a practice in Sri Lanka, making of an"
"assessment without giving notice of assessment within the time bar period is not"
"valid."
"[220] The question that arose in Ismail v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra)"
"and  in    D.M.S.  Fernando  and  another  v.  Ismail  (supra)  was  whether  the  duty  is"
"imposed  on  the  Assessor  who  rejects  a  return  in  terms  of  section  93(5)  of  the"
"Inland Revenue Act No. 4 of 1963 (as amended) to state reasons, and if so, whether"
"the communication of reasons in writing is mandatory and requires compliance."
"[221]  The 
  question  of  whether  the  time  bar  applies  to  the  making  of  the"
"assessment or the notice of assessment was considered in Stafford Motor Company"
"(Pvt) Limited v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CA Tax 17 of 2017 decided"
"on 15.03.2019). Janak de Silva J., stated in Stafford Motor Company (Pvt) Limited v."
"Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) that the  question of whether the"
"time bar applies to the making of assessment or the notice of assessment did no"
"arise for determination either in the Court of Appeal case, or in the Supreme Court"
"case, and therefore, there is no binding precedent established in the said two cases"
"on the said issue (Vide-page 9 of the judgment)."
"[222] It is relevant to note that the Court of Appeal in Cables v. CGIR (supra) and"
"John keels Holdings v CGIR (supra) refused to follow the decision of the Court of"
"Appeal in Commissioner General Tax v. Chettinand Corporation 55 NLR 556, Honig"
"& Others (Administrator of Emmanuel (Honig) v. Sarsfield (H. M. Inspector of Taxes)"
"Ch.  Div.  (1985)  STRC  31  (CA)  /  (CA)  (1986  STC  246  and  Stafford  Motors  v  CGIR"
"(supra)."
"[223]  The  decisions 
in  all  these  cases  were  based  on  the  well  established"
"proposition that the making of the assessment and serving of notice of assessment"
"are two different acts. In Honig & Others (Administrators of Emmanuel (Honig) v."
"Sarsfield  (H.  M.  Inspector  of  Taxes)  (supra),  some  weeks  before  the  time  limit  in"
"section  40  of  the  Taxes  Management  Act,  1970,  the 
Inspector  of  Taxes  on"
"16.03.1970  raised  assessments  against  the  administrators  of  Emanuel  Honig  by"
"signing  certificates  to  that  effect  where  he  entered  into  the  assessment  book"
"stating  that  he  had  made  assessments  on  the  administrators.  The  notices  of"
"assessment were issued on 16.03.1970 but did not reach the administrators until"
"after 07.04.1970. The time bar for the making of the assessment was 06.04.1970"
"under sections 34(1) and 40 of the Taxes Management Act, 1970."
