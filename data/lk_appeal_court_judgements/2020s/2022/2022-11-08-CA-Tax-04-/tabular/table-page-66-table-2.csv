"Revenue (supra) held that the “making of the assessment” is same as “giving of"
"assessment” and therefore, no lawfully valid assessment can be made without first"
"serving a notice of assessment. Samarakoon J., stated at pp. 24-25 as follows:"
"“Therefore, both Justice Victor Perera and the learned Chief Justice have"
"based  their  judgments  in  the  premise  that  “making  the  assessment”  is"
"same as “giving notice of assessment”” This was why it had been argued in"
"CA  Tax  17/2017  that  no  lawfully  valid  assessment  can  be  made  without  first"
"serving  a  valid  notice  of  assessment.  The  Division  of  this  Court  in  C.A.  Tax"
"17/2017  though  that  this  is  a  practical  impossibility.  A  letter  cannot  be  sent"
"without  being  written.  But  what  was  meant  is  not  this.  The  argument  of  the"
"appellant is that an “assessment” becomes valid only when the “notice” is given."
"This position was the basis of Ismail despite those two cases were concurred with"
"the duty to give reasons. The position of the appellant is that an “assessment” is"
"no “assessment” until “notice of assessment” is given. The position could have"
"been otherwise, viz. an “assessment” could have been a valid assessment, as soon"
