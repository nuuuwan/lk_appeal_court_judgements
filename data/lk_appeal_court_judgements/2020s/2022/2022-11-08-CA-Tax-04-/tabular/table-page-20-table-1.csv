"[","59] From the wording of section 83, it is clear that a manufacture is a process of"

"section 83 and no other meaning can be assigned to a manufacturer.",""
"[60] The argument of the learned Senior Additional Solicitor General is, however,",""
"that 
the  VAT  Act  does  not  describe  what  physical  acts  would  amount","to"
