"[","46] On the other hand, the learned Senior Additional Solicitor General submitted",""
"that the wholesale and retail supply of goods is carried out by a manufacturer or","",""
"importer are subject to VAT. She submitted, however, that the different acts which","",""
"are covered under the definition of “manufacture” do not necessarily coincide with","",""
"the person who is deemed to be the manufacturer for the purposes of the VAT Act.","",""
"[","47]  Her  submission  was  that  the  Appellant  is  engaged  in  the  exploitation  of",""
"intangible property as a sole and only licensee of Unilever, in terms of Article 3 of","",""
"the  Trade  Mark  Agreement","in  connection  with","the  manufacture,  packing,"
"advertising  and","sale  of  Unilever  products.  She","further 
submitted 
that 
the"
"exploitation of intangible property is a taxable activity as defined in section 83 of","",""
"the  VAT  Act.  Her  contention  was  that  in  terms  of  section  3  of  the  Trade  Mark","",""
