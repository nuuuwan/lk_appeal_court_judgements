"for the calculation of time limit of 2 years specified in section 140 (10) commences",""
"‘from the date of the oral hearing’ and ‘not from the date of filing of the petition",""

"[26]  I  will  now  turn  to  the  submission  made  by  the  learned  Additional  Solicitor",""
"General that the word ""shall” used in section 10 is normally to be interpreted as",""
"connoting a (directory) and not mandatory provision. She submitted that the effect",""
"of  any  breach  does  not  render  the  determination  invalid  in  the  absence  of  any",""
"consequences being specified in the legislation. Her submission was that the  Tax",""
"Appeals Commission Act does not spell out any sanction for the failure on the part",""
"of the Tax Appeals commission to comply with the time limit set out in section 10",""
"of the Tax Appeals Commission Act. She invited us to hold that the time limit set",""
"out  in  section  10  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act  is  only  directory,  and  not",""
"mandatory.",""
"Mandatory-directory classification",""
"[27] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Act stipulates that the Tax Appeals Commission",""
"shall make its determination within 270 days of the commencement of the hearing",""
"of the appeal. Superficially, the effects of non-compliance of a provision are dealt",""
"with  in  terms  of  the  mandatory-directory  classification.  Generally,  in  case  of  a",""
"mandatory provision, the act done in breach thereof is void, whereas, in case of a",""

some  other"
"consequences  may 
follow 
(P.M.  Bakshi,","Interpretation  of  Statutes,  First  Ed,"
