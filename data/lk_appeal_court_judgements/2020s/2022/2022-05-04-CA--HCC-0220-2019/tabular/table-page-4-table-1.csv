"court will be slow in overruling her decision on the demeanour and"

is  manifestly  wrong  where"

In  case  of  State  of  U.P.  V.  M.K.  Anthony  [1985]  CRI.L.J.  493,"
"Indian Supreme Court held:"
"“While  appreciating 
the  evidence  of  a  witness, 
the"
"approach must be whether the evidence of the witness read as a"
"whole appears to have a ring of truth. Once that impression is"
"formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the Court to scrutinise"
"the 
evidence  more 
particularly 
keeping 
in 
view 
of 
the"
"deficiencies,  draw-backs  and 
infirmities  pointed  out 
in 
the"
"evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is"
"against  the general tenor of the evidence given  by the witness"
"and whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as"
"to render it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial"
"matters  not 
touching 
the  core  of 
the  case,  hyper-technical"
"approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or there"
"from 
the  evidence,  attaching 
importance 
to  some

"error  committed  by  the  investigating  officer  not  going  to  the:"

"evidence as a whole. If the Court before whom the witness gives"
"evidence  had  the  opportunity  to  form  the  opinion  about  the"
"general  tenor  of  evidence  given  by  the  witness,  the  appellate"
"Court which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight"
"to  the  appreciation  of  evidence  by  the  trial  Court  and  unless"
"there  are  reasons  weighty  and 
formidable 
it  would  not  be"
"proper to reject the evidence on the ground of minor variations"
"or infirmities in the matter of trivial details. …”"

learned  Counsel  for 
the  appellant  also  submitted 
that 
the"
"evidence of the Deputy Government Analyst who was called by the"
"defence  was, 
that 
the  weapon  alleged 
to  be  recovered  on 
the"
"statement  made  by 
the 
appellant 
and  was  produced  by 
the"
"prosecution,  was  defective.  However, 
the  said  witness  clearly"
"testified  that  irrespective  of the technical  defects,  the weapon  can"
"be used to fire, and also that it has been used before."
