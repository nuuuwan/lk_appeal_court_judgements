"In this regard, I refer to the observation made by the Supreme Court"
"of  India  in  Whirlpool  Corporation  v  Registrar  of  Trademarks,"
"Mumbai, (1998) 8 SCC 1. It was that"
"“Under  Article  226  of  the  Constitution,  the  High  Court,  having"
"regard to the facts of the case, has the discretion to entertain or"
"not to entertain a writ petition. But the High Court has imposed"
"upon itself certain restrictions one of which is that if an effective"
"and  efficacious  remedy  is  available,  the  High  Court  would  not"
"normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has"
"been consistently held by this Court not to operate as a bar in at"
"least  three  contingencies,  namely,  where  the  writ  petition  has"
"been filed for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights"
"or  where  there  has  been  a  violation  of  the  principle  of  natural"
"justice  or  where  the  order  or  proceedings  are  wholly  without"
"jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged.”"
