"The 4th Respondent who was the secretary to the treasury, who had issued the"
"Circular  No.  1  of  2013  had  stated 
in  his  statement  of  objections  that  the"
"aforesaid circular does not have any statutory force and therefore cannot be"
"enforced by way of a Writ of Mandamus. He had denied the fact that the 2nd"
"Respondent is a state-controlled entity and had stated that the applicability of"
"the  aforesaid  circular 
is  only  to  the  employees  of  the  public  enterprises."
"Therefore,  the  4th  Respondent  has  taken  up  the  position  that  the  aforesaid"
"circular does not apply to the Petitioners."
