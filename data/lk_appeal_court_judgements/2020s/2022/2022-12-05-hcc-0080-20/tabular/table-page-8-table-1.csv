"necessary equipment for a raid of this nature,  and left the  police  station after"
"checking the other officers who took part in the raid and the police jeep to ensure"
"that  nothing  unwarranted  is  carried  by  any  member  of  the  raiding  party.  His"
"evidence was that all this took just 5 minutes and he and his team left the station"
"at 6.45 in the morning."
"The question here is whether it is possible for a reasonably prudent person to do"
"all  these  things  and 
leave 
in 
just  5  minutes  after  the 
information.  When"
"questioned 
in  this  regard,  PW-01  has  explained,  saying  that  since 
it  was"
"important  to  take  action  immediately,  he  left  the  station  within  5  minutes."
"However, the information he received had been that the trafficker would come"
"around 7.30 in the morning to the location mentioned by the informant. That"
"means PW-01 had over 50 minutes he only had to travel about 500-600 meters"
"to reach the location. Therefore, it is not possible to believe the need for the PW-"
"01 to act immediately as claimed. If the information was that the trafficker would"
"come within 5-10 minutes, such an information can be treated as an information"
"that needs very fast action. In such a scenario, even an officer leaving the station"
"without 
following  all  the  required  procedures  can  be 
justified.  Under  the"
"circumstances, I am of the view that the evidence of the PW-01 that he and his"
"team after following all the due procedures, left the station within five minutes"
"is not a piece of evidence that can be considered probable."
"When it comes to the evidence of PW-04 the female police officer who assisted"
"PW-01 in the detection, she has been informed by the officer who was in charge"
"of the police reserve to get ready to go for a raid at 6.30 in the morning. Contrary"
"to  that,  it  has  been  brought  to  the  notice  of  the  Court  that  in  her  notes  with"
"regard to the time, she has mentioned that she was asked to get ready at 6.20"
"am. Her evidence with regard to the time cut across the evidence of PW-01 who"
"says  he  received  the  information  at  6.40  in  the  morning.  If  he  received  the"
"information at that time, it was not probable for the PW-04 to be informed to get"
"ready  for  the  raid  before  the  receiving  of  the  information,  which  leads  to  the"
"question whose evidence is to be believed in this regard. I am of the view that"
