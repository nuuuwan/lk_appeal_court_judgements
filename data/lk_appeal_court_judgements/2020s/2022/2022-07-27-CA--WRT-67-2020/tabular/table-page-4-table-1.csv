"2003. Access International categorically states that number plates for the vehicle concerned"
"“were not issued as we did not receive the required approvals from the designated Officials"
"of  the  Department  of  Motor  Traffic”.  This  letter  also  references  “reject  reports”  dated  27th"
"September  2018  and  11th  April  2019.  In  respect  of  the  latter,  Access  International  had"
"received a “don’t print order” from the Assistant Commissioner of the Department."
"The  reject  report  dated  27th  September  2018  (marked  “R2”)  contains  an  entry  in"
"respect  of  GY-6707  which  states  “Un-issued  Vehicle  No.”,  thereby  lending  support  to  the"
"Respondent’s contention that the number plates for that vehicle were not issued as of 27th"
"September 2018. The vehicle could not have been used if no number plates had  ever been"
"printed. Yet, this Court observes, that for a vehicle that could not have run, interestingly, as"
"noted in the valuation report (discussed below), the meter reading denotes 71933 KM."
"On the other hand, in terms of the Petitioner’s version of the story, this vehicle did in"
"fact have number plates.  However, around the time when the purchase of the vehicle was"
"being completed, the Petitioner was informed by Bandara Auto Traders, through which the"
"vehicle was purchased, that the original number plates had been “misplaced” by the previous"
"owner at a garage where the vehicle was repaired a few months earlier. A matter which the"
"Petitioner admits he did not take seriously. The Petitioner submitted a copy of the complaint"
"made by the previous owner to the Kurunegala Police on the 30th of May 2019 (marked “P10”)."
"It is remarkable that in the written submissions of the Petitioner (at p. 13) a rather"
"cavalier statement is made thus:"
"“Thus, the Petitioner obviously knew at the time of purchasing the said vehicle that"
"the number plates attached to it were not those issued by the Department of Motor Traffic."
"However, as indicated above; his concern was not whether the number-plates were genuine"
"or not; but whether the vehicle was a genuine one duly registered by the Department of Motor"
"Traffic…” [emphasis added]"
"It must be  noted that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  obtain the Original  Certificate  of"
"Registration or a copy thereof issued in 2003 to the original owner. Further, the Petitioner"
"has not obtained affidavits from the previous three owners, to substantiate his position, that"
"number plates had been issued for the vehicle."
