"Had  the  Procurement  Committee  intended  to  invite  the  bidders  to  submit  a  worth"
"certificate to the total value of the several sites of the same hospital that could have been"
"expressly stated in those conditions. In my view, this is the best interpretation that I could"
"give upon the said clause 1.VIII in order to afford equal opportunity to every bidder. It is"
"the duty of the Procurement Committee to express all bidding conditions without creating"
