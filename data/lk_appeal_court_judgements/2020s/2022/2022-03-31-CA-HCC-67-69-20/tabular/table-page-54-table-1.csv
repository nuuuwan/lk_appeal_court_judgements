"The principle of 'withdrawal' from an unlawful assembly was discussed at length in the recent case"
"of  Vithanalage  Anura  Thushara  De  Mel  &  others  vs.  Hon.  AG  SC/TAB/2A  â€”  D/2017,  decided  on"
"11.10.2018.  The  learned  senior  DSG  says  that  two  crucial  questions  arise  for  consideration  in"
"respect of the instant matter."
"(i) 
Did the appellants continue to be members of the unlawful assembly from the start"
"of the transaction which involved causing mischief to the decorations until the point"
"of shooting?"
"(ii) 
Did the appellants (especially the 3rd accused-appellant) disavow the common object"
"by  clear  expressions  leaving  no  doubt  that  he  had  withdrawn  from  the  unlawful"
"assembly?"
"Learned counsel for the respondent argued that the evidence led at the trial clearly indicate that"
"the appellants were part of the unlawful assembly from its inception and had engaged in causing"
"damage to the decorations of the opposite party starting from the clock tower until the location"
"of the shooting. It is probable that, if PW 3 had not intervened, the unlawful assembly would have"
"proceeded to the location of the meeting organized by the victim party. Therefore, until the point"
"of  shooting,  the  appellants  and  the  others  continued  to  be  part  of  the  unlawful  assembly.  The"
"words uttered by the 3rd accused-appellant as indicated by PW 3 is a clear indication of the same."
"Further,  it  was  contended  for  the  respondent  that  there  is  no  evidence  adduced  during  the"
"entirety  of  the  trial  that  either  of  the  appellants  made  public  any 
intention  to  cease  to  be"
"members  of  the  unlawful  assembly.  They  failed  to  directly  or  indirectly  disavow  the  common"
"object or their membership from the unlawful assembly until the point of shooting."
"Thus, for the respondent it was argued that the only logical conclusion which could be arrived at,"
"based on the available evidence is that the appellants continued to be a part of the said unlawful"
"assembly,  even  at  the  time  of  the  shooting.  Although  the 
identity  of  the 
'shooter' 
is  not"
"established,  the  available  evidence  clearly  establish  that  shots  were 
fired 
from  the  group"
"accompanied by the appellants, towards the opposite party which included PW 1, the deceased"
"and the victims (PW 05 & 06). This aspect was analysed by the learned trial Judge in the course of"
"the  judgment  as  well.  Counsel  for  the  respondent  says  that  having  regard  to  the  judicial  dicta"
"referred  to  above,  the 
likelihood  of  a  shooting  taking  place  was  a  real  and  highly  probable"
"considering the nature of the events preceding the shooting."
"The learned Senior DSG submits that it is reasonable to infer beyond reasonable doubt that the"
"members  of  the  unlawful  assembly  and  ought  to  have  foreseen  these  events,  considering  the"
"propensity  towards  violent  behaviour  they  displayed.  It 
is  also 
interesting  to  note  that,  the"
"presence of the 2nd and 3rd accused-appellants was admitted by the defence. Thus, their presence"
"at the location at the time they spoke to PW 3 was never in issue."
"The 4th to 7th accused were acquitted on 26.02.2019 subsequent to the order of the learned trial"
"Judge, when the prosecution closed their case."
"Perusing  the  said  order,  it  is  clear  that  the  basis  upon  which  the  said  4th  to  7th  accused  were"
"acquitted, was due to absence of evidence relating to Identity. However, it is clear that the same"
"issues  do  not  apply 
to 
the  convicted  1st,  2nd  and  3rd  accused-appellants.  Further,  added"
