"About  these  materials  presented  before  the  Court  on  behalf  of  the  2nd  accused-appellant,  the",""
"learned trial Judge has arrived at adverse finding as follows;",""
"(i)","“When  the  3rd  accused-appellant  led  a  violent  mob  which  was  armed  with  illegal"
"","weapons,  both  1st  and  2nd  accused-appellants  would  have  foreseen  a  calamity  like"
"","this.  Accordingly,  they  are  not  exempted  from  the  liability  stemming  from  the  acts"
"","committed by this unlawful assembly.”"
"(ii)","“The 2nd accused has himself admitted his presence at crime scene and has failed to"
"","explain  what  prompted  him  to  fuel  his  vehicle  between  12.00  am  -  1.00  am  in  the"
"","middle of the night.”"
"(iii)","“Both  the  1st  and  the  2nd  accused,  being  close  political  confederates  of  the  3rd"
"","accused-appellant had not taken any attempt to either subdue or disperse the unruly"
"","mob, a fact that lends credence to infer that, all 3 accused had been instigating the"
"","violent group of people together.”"
