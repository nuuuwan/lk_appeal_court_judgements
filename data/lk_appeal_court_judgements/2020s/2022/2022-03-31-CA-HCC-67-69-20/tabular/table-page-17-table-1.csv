"(iii)","The  CCTV  footage  clearly 
indicated  the  presence  of  firearms  among  this  group  of"
"","persons,  clearly  led  by  the  3rd  accused-appellant.  It  would  be  obnoxious  to  common"
"","intelligence  to  suggest  that  appellants  did  not  have  knowledge  of  the  possession  of"
"","such a firearm by one of the members of the unlawful assembly, when such a firearm"
"","was carried openly."
"(iv)","The  appellants  and  the  members  of  the  unlawful  assembly  very  well  knew  the"
"","campaign  meeting  organised  by  the  opposition  party,  wherein  a  number  of  political"
"","supporters were obviously present."
"(v)","It  would  once  again  be  obnoxious  to  suggest  that,  a  tense  situation  would  not  arise,"
"","when the group of persons led by the appellants were causing damage and removing"
"","the  decorations  adorned  by 
the  opposition  party,  and  proceeding 
towards 
the"
"","premises wherein the meeting was being organised."
"(vi)","In light of the above, the appellants, especially the 3rd accused-appellant, as the leader"
"","of the said group clearly could have foreseen an imminent incident between the two"
"","fractions."
"(vii)","Even  for  the  sake  of  argument,  if  it  is  deemed  that  such  was  not  apparent  at  the"
"","inception, the likelihood of a clash was made plain to the 3rd accused-appellant by PW"
"","3.  Thus,  the  imminent  threat  to  peace,  and  likelihood  of  injury  was  brought  to  the"
"","personal  attention  of  the  3rd  accused-appellant  and  the  2nd  accused-appellant,  who"
"","was accompanying him at the time."
"(viii)","The learned trial Judge has analysed the above in detail, and correctly reasoned as to"
"","why  the  failure  of  the  3rd  accused-appellant  to effectively direct  the  fellow  members"
"","with  regard  to  the  unlawful  assembly  to  disperse  would  entail  liability  under  section"
"","146."
