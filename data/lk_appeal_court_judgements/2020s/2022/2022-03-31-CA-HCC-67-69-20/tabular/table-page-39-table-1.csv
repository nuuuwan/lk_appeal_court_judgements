"innocence""."
"The fact that the weakness of the defence case should not bolster the prosecution case was not"
"correctly  identified  in  the  judgment.  The  learned  trial  Judge  was  not  mindful  that  suspicious"
"circumstances would not entail liability on the accused, and it was the duty of the prosecution to"
"prove  the  case  beyond  reasonable  doubt  based  on  credible  evidence.  At  the  outset 
in  the"
"judgment,  the 
learned  trial  Judge  has  not 
identified  the  proper  manner  of  evaluating  the"
"credibility of witnesses, including the tests relating to evaluating credibility."
"The  importance  attached  in  evaluating  credibility  by  the  trial  Judge  has  been  stressed  by  the"
"superior courts and certain established tests have been laid down."

"to Credibility and testimonial trustworthiness of a witness is a question of fact and not a question"
"of law""."

"is therefore a question of fact for the trial Judge""."
"It has been accepted that 'Credibility' is a matter for the trial judge."
"In Dharmasiri vs Republic of Sri Lanka 2010 (2) SLR 241, Justice Sisira De Abrew referring to the"
"cases of Fraud vs. Brown & Company Limited 20 NLR 282 and Alwis vs. Piyasena Fernando (1993)"
"1 SLR 119 held that ""Credibility of a witness is mainly a matter for the trial Judge, Court of Appeal"
"will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial Judge with regard to the credibility of a witness unless"
"such findings of trial Judge are manifestly wrong""."
"Similar observations were made in the following cases;"

"the  learned  High  court  Judge  has  concluded  that  the  prosecution  had  proved  the  case  beyond"
"reasonable doubt establishing the existence of unlawful assembly and that the 1st to 3rd accused-"
"appellants  were  members  of  that  unlawful  assembly.  It  was  further  argued  that  there  is  no"
"evidence  adduced  during  the  entirety  of  the  trial  that  either  of  the  appellants  had  made  public"
"any 
intention  to  cease  to  be  members  of  the  unlawful  assembly.  They  failed  to  directly  or"
"indirectly  deny  the  common  object  or  their  membership  from  the  unlawful  assembly  until  the"
"point of shooting."
