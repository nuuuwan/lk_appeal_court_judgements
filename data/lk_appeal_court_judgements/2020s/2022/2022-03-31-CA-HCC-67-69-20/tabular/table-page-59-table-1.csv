"On the premises aforementioned this Court sets aside the judgement dated 31.07.2020 whereby"
"the  1st,  2nd  and  3rd  accused-appellants  were  convicted  and  sentenced 
to  death  and  now"
"pronounces a fresh judgment of acquittal from all charges in the indictment."
"The  case  against  the  accused-appellants  were  not  proven  beyond  reasonable  doubt  and  the"
"conviction  is  not  within  the  well-established  principles  of  law  as  enumerated  above.  In  those"
"circumstances, the conviction of the accused-appellants cannot stand in law and is set aside and"
"the  1st,  2nd  and  3rd  accused-appellants  are  acquitted  and  discharged  from  all  charges 
in  the"
"indictment of this case."
"The appeal is allowed and the conviction quashed."
"Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment along with the main case record to the High"
"Court of Rathnapura and a copy of the Judgement to the prison authorities forthwith."
