"accused who was the then Chairman of Kahawaththa Pradeshiya Sabha. The 2nd accused-appellant"
"stood near the Pajero but neither did nor declared anything as inciting the mob. The 1st accused-"
"appellant too was identified nearby, standing outside the vehicle but PW 1 did not see what he"
"was doing."
"PW  1  asserted that  it  was  at that moment  (time  was  around  2.00  am) the  gunshots  were fired."
"Immediately after the shooting, the 3rd accused boarded his vehicle and left the scene and the 1st"
"and  the  2nd  accused  too  left  the  scene  simultaneously.  He  recollected that  the  shots  were  fired"
"and  the  lightening  of  the  shots  was  spotted  in  the  direction  where  the  3rd  accused-appellant’s"
"vehicle had blocked the road. Immediately afterwards, he darted over a nearby parapet wall and"
"sought refuge. In the cross-examination on behalf of the 1st accused-appellant, the fact that of the"
"1st  accused  person  being  outside  the  3rd  accused  person’s  vehicle  at  the  crime  scene  was"
"contested by spotting three omissions in that regard as against his  first statement to the police,"
"statement to the CID and evidence in the inquest."
"In the cross-examination on behalf of the 2nd accused-appellant, it was established that a political"
"rivalry  had  existed  between  PW  1  and  the  2nd  accused  person  who  was  then  the  Chairman  of"
"Kahawaththa  Pradeshiya  Shaba  of  which  PW  1  used  to  be  a  member,  representing  opposing"

"the  3rd  accused  and  Hon.  Thalatha  Athukorala  for  whom  PW  1  functioned  as  a  coordinating"
"secretary  was  suggested  as  both  represented  Nivithigala  Electoral  Seat.  Three  omissions  on  the"
"facts of his (3rd accused) being partially outside the vehicle were spotted light as against the first"
"statement of PW 1, statement to CID and evidence in the inquest. Also, an omission was brought"
"to the notice of the Court that, he had failed to mention the direction from which the shooting"
"was claimed to have emanated in his first statement to the police. Also, it was sought to establish"
"that,  PW  1  did  not  corroborate  PW  3  although  both  alleged  to  have  been  present  at  the  crime"
"scene at the same time."
"The  next  eye  witness  Susantha  Saman  Bodaragama,  Inspector  of  Police  (PW  3)  was  the  OIC  of"
