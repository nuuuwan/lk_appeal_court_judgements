"However, the learned trial Judge has drawn following adverse inferences from the mere presence"
"of the 2nd accused-appellant where the shooting occurred."
"1.  When the 3rd accused led a violent mob which was armed with illegal weapons, both the"
"1st  and  2nd  accused  would  have  foreseen  a  calamity  like  this,  accordingly,  they  are  not"
"exempted from the liability stemming from the acts committed by this unlawful assembly."
"2.  The 2nd accused has himself admitted his presence at crime scene and has failed to explain"
"what  prompted  him  to  fuel  his  vehicle  between  12.00am  -  1.00am  in  the  middle  of  the"
"night."
"3.  Both the 1st and 2nd accused, being close political confederates of the 3rd accused had not"
"taken any attempt to either subdue or disperse the unruly mob, a fact that lends credence"
"to infer that, all 3 accused had been instigating the violent group of people together."
