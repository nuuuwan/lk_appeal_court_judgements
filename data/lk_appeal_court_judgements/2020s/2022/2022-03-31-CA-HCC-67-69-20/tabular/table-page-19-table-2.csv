"Although  witness  Bodaragama (PW  3)  maintained  this  position  very  clearly  and  did  testify  as to"
"the  presence  of  the  1st  accused,  who  was  a  well-known  politician  who  had  served 
in  the"
"Kahawaththa Pradeshiya Sabha, and the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, witness Hathalawatta"
"(PW  1)  stated  that,  he  was 
informed  by  some  persons  that  some  decorations  were  being"
"vandalized and that he came to the main road and after proceeding some distance on the main"
"road, and at or around the Rathnapura Gold House witnessed the shooting. He maintained that"
"upon  the  first  gunshot  being  fired  he  took  cover  behind  an  area  between  two  buildings.  He"
"maintained 
that  he 
thereafter 
saw 
the  1st,  2nd  and  3rd  accused  being  present.  Witness"
"Hathalawatta's evidence was not specific as to where he first saw the 1st accused or what the 1st"
"accused was engaged in doing."
"For the accused-appellants it was argued that the learned High Court Judge had failed to consider"
"the  creditworthiness  in  the  evidence  of  prosecution  witnesses,  especially  of  PW  1  and  PW  3.  It"
"reflects from the evidence clearly, that PW 1 had spoken of only one shooting whereas PW 3 had"
"spoken  of three  gunshots  and  then  a burst.  Moreover,  PW  3  giving  evidence  stated  that  before"
"the first firing, the UNP supporters had hooted at the appellants."
"Then,  after  the  first  firing,  the  UNP  organizers  ran  towards  the  vehicles  pelting  stones  at  them"
"when there was a second burst. None of such evidence had been elicited in PW  1’s version who"
"affirmatively stated about his presence at the scene. It raises serious doubt as to the versions of"
"PW 1 and PW 3, who according to their versions of evidence had taken cover from the gunfire at"
"the  same place  which  is  a  narrow  plot after the  Rathnapura  Gold  House  but had  not  seen each"
"other at all."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  accepted  the  evidence  of  PW  1  stating  that  PW  1's  evidence"
"was  credible  because  his  evidence  was  not  subject  to  any  contradiction.  It  is  important  to  note"
"that the learned trial Judge had failed, in evaluating the evidence of the witnesses, to apply the"
"tests  of  probability  and 
improbability, 
consistency  and 
inconsistency, 
interestedness  and"
"disinterestedness  and  spontaneity  and  belatedness.  The 
learned 
Judge  had  evaluated 
the"
"evidence of the prosecution separately and not as a whole, especially the evidence of PW 1 and"
"PW 3 who were considered to be the two main witnesses and had shifted the burden of proof to"
"the accused-appellants."
