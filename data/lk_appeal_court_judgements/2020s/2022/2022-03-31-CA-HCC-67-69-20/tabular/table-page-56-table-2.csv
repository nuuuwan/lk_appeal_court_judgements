"In the case of The Queen vs P.G. Arasa and Another 70 NLR 404 it was held;"
"""This  court  has  held  on  numerous  occasions  that  mere  presence 
is  not  a  sufficient"
"circumstance  to  justify  an  inference  of  common  intention.  Such  an  inference  would  not"
"have been reached in this case but for inference by the learned Trial Judge to the fact that"
"the second appellant ""did nothing to prevent the first accused from stabbing"". According"
"to  the  evidence  the  stabbing  took  place  so  suddenly  that  it  was 
in  our  opinion  quite"
"unreasonable  to  suggest  to  the 
jury  that  the  second  appellant  should  have  tried  to"
"interfere"""
