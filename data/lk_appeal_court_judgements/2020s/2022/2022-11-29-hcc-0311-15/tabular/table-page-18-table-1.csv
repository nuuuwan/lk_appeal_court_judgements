"from which he acquired the property and demonstrating that it was not by bribery. As"
"this  is  a  matter  in  which  the  onus  is  on  the  accused  person,  it  will  be  sufficient  if  he"
"establishes it on a balance of probabilities,'"
"In L.C. Fernando vs. Republic of Sri Lanka 79 (2) NLR 313 at 319 it was decided that;"
"'The  offence  then  depends  on  the  legal  presumption.  But  that  legal  presumption  will"
"apply  to  the  property  and  will  only  last  ""until  the  contrary  is  proved  by  him'.  The"
"legislature  has  clearly  stated by  whom  ""the  contrary""  is  to  be  proved.  It  is  not  by the"
"prosecution. It is by ""him"", that is the person who owns or has acquires such property."
"He knows best how he acquired it. It Is within his special knowledge. Consequently, he is"
"in a position to show that it was not acquired from bribery what is it that ""he' has to prove"
"or, as the learned Trial Judge stated, contrary of what? Contrary of ""that such property"
"acquired by him by bribery."" He has to prove that the property was not acquired from"
"income or receipts from bribery, i.e., the property was not acquired from any gratification"
"accepted in contravention of Part ii of the Bribery Act'"
