"provisions give a discretionary power to the Civil Court with regard to costs in all actions."
"The said section 211(1) reads;"
"“(1) The court shall have full power to give and apportion costs of every application"
"and action in any manner it thinks fit, and the fact that the court has no jurisdiction"
"to try the case is no bar to the exercise of such power:"
"Provided that if the court directs that the costs of any application or action shall"
"not follow the event, the court shall state its reasons in writing.”"
