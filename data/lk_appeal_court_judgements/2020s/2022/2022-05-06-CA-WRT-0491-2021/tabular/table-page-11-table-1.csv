"In Public Interest Law Foundation vs. Central Environmental Authority and others,"
"CA/Writ/527/2015 (decided on 24.02.2020), Samayawardhena J. held as follows;"
"“Public interest litigation is a hallowed concept. Nevertheless, public interest litigation shall"
"not be converted to public vexatious litigation. Frivolous and vexatious applications cost the"
"judiciary and Government agencies dearly. Such applications inter alia impede the efficacy"
"of the Courts by detracting from the limited time and resources available to devote to cases"
"which legitimately deserve attention. Public interest litigation shall be a boon not a bane.”"
