"Speaking  on  the  said  Section,  Malani  Gunaratne  Case  (supra)  made  the  following"
"observation:"
"“Section  139  (1)  requires  a  Magistrate  to  form  an  opinion  as  to  whether  there  is"
"sufficient ground for proceeding against some person who is not in custody. I am"
"of the view that the opinion to be formed should relate to the offence the commission"
"of which is alleged in the complaint or plaint filed under section 136 (1). The words"
"""sufficient ground"" embraces both, the ingredients of the offence and the"
"evidence as to its commission. The use of the word opinion does not make the"
"action of the Magistrate a purely subjective exercise.  Since the opinion relates  to"
"the existence of sufficient ground for proceeding against the person accused, the"
"material acted upon by the Magistrate should withstand an objective assessment."
"I am of the view that the proper test is to ascertain whether on the material before"
"Court, prima facie, there is sufficient ground on which it may be reasonably"
"inferred  that  the  offence  as  alleged  in  the  complaint  or  plaint  has  been"
"committed by the person who is accused of it.” (Emphasis added)"
