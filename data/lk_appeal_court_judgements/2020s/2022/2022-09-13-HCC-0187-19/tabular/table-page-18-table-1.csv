"The  learned  Judge  has  considered  not  having  previous  convictions"
"and  repentance  for  committing  the  offence  as  mitigatory  factors.  In"
"this case, the accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges and"
"after the trial, the learned High Court Judge found him guilty. I do not"
"find here any evidence of repentance on the part of the appellant."
