"which was taken only at the tail end of the case,  cannot be accepted"
"and thus the said version casts no doubt on the prosecution case."
"E
vidence given by children"
"The  appellant's  counsel  also  contended  that  after  the  incident,  when"
"the mother, PW2, asked what had happened, the daughter, PW1, said"
"nothing.  The  learned  counsel  attempted  to  show  that  PW1  remained"
"silent because nothing happened. However, according to the mother’s"
"evidence, only at that moment, her daughter did not say anything. In"
"a  short  while,  the  mother,  father  and  daughter  went  to  the  police"
"station and lodge a complaint about the sexual abuse."
"A
t the time of the incident, PW1 was a 14-year-old child. In the case of"
"Thimbirigolle  Sirirathana  v.  OIC,  Police  Station,  Rasnayakepura  -  CA"
"No. 194/2015, decided on 07.05.2019, it was discussed the behavior"
"of a child who had experienced sexual abuse. It was held in this case"
"that “when a child is sexually assaulted by an adult, it is also natural"
"for the victim’s family to think twice before making a complaint to the"
"police”.    But  in  the  instant  action,  there  was  no  delay  in  making  a"
"complaint.  Also,  it  was  held  that  “in  cases  of  sexual  offences,  Courts"
"have found that victims of sexual offences can react in different ways."
"Some may complain immediately. Others may feel for example afraid,"
"shocked,  ashamed,  confused,  or  even  guilty  and  may  not  speak  out"
"until some time has passed. There is no typical reaction. (Crown Court"
"compendium  part  1,  May  2016)”.  So,  this  is  a  natural  response  of  a"
"child  who  faced  such  a  situation.  Therefore,  the  mother’s  evidence"
"that  the  daughter  said  nothing  soon  after  she  came  from  the  temple"
"with her father and brother cast no doubt on her evidence."
"T
he trial Judge’s findings should not be lightly disturbed"
"In the aforementioned Court of Appeal judgment, it was also held that"
"“The trial Judge before whom the witnesses testified is the best person"
"11"
