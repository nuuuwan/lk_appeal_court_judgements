"T
he observations of the case Rex V. James Jarvis reported in XX Cox's"
"Criminal Cases, 249 in respect of the offence of kidnapping have been"
"cited in the said Indian Judgement as follows:"
"“Jelf J., has stated the law thus to the jury:"
"Although  there  must  be  a  taking,  yet  it  is  quite  clear  that  an"
"actual physical taking away of the girl is not necessary to render the"
"prisoner  liable  to  conviction;  it  is  sufficient  if  he  persuaded  her  to"
"leave her home or go away with him by persuasion or blandishments.”"
