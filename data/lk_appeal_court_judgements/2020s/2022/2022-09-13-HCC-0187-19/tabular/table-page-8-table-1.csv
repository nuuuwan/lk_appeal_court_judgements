"refusal  to  act  on  the  testimony  of  a  victim  of  sexual  assault  in  the"
"absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to the injury”."
"I
t is needless to state that sexual offences are not committed in public."
"Therefore,  it  is  natural  that  there  would  be  hardly  any  eye-witnesses"
"to  testify  about  the  sexual  abuse.  In  the  case  of  Gurcharan  Singh  V."
"State  of  Haryane  –  AIR  (1972)  SC  2661  also,  it  was  observed  that  in"
"this type of cases court normally looks for some corroboration. It was"
"held thus:"
"“As a rule of prudence, however, court normally looks for some"
"corroboration of her testimony so as to testify its conscience that she"
"is telling the truth and that the person accused of rape on her has not"
"been falsely implicated.”"
"T
he substance of the said decision was that corroboration is needed to"
"prevent false implications. In the case at hand, the fact that the victim"
"came  to  him  is  admitted  by  the  appellant.  The  appellant  also  stated"
"that  he  spoke  to  her  for  3-4  minutes.  Hence,  the  identity  of  the"
"appellant  is  not  an  issue  in  this  case.  The  only  issue  is  whether  he"
"sexually abused her or he only spoke to her for 3-4 minutes."
"I
n  the  case  of  Sunil  and  another  V.  The  Attorney  General  –  (1986)  1"
"Sri L.R. 230, it went on to state that “It is very dangerous to act on the"
"uncorroborated  testimony  of  a  woman  victim  of  a  sex  offence”,  but  it"
"was held further that “but if her evidence is convincing, such evidence"
"could be acted on even in the absence of corroboration”."
"T
he  following  judicial  authorities  clearly  held  that  a  conviction  for"
"sexual  offences  could  be  arrived  on  the  uncorroborative  evidence  of"
"the victim."
"It was held in the cases of The King V. Themis Singho – 45 NLR"
"378, and Premasiri and another V. The Queen – 77 NLR 85 that “In a"
"charge of rape, it is proper for a Jury to convict on the uncorroborated"
