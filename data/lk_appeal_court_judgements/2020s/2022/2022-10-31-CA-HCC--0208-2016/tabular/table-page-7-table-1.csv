"In  Mark  Antony  Fernando  v.  AG  CA/84/97  decided  on  08/10/1998  the"
"court held that:"
"“…the  judge  has  to  decide  (…)  whether  there  was  a  very  great  antecedent"
"probability of the injury resulting in death as opposed to a mere likelihood."
"That  function  cannot  be  delegated  to  the  expert.  The  judge  is  expected  to"
"decide this issue assisted by the evidence of the expert but independently of"
"the opinion expressed by the expert.”"
