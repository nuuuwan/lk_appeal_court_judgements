"I need to reiterate that I am mindful of Basnayake CJ.’s statement on the cursus curiae"
"that  developed  over  the  years  in  this  country.  He  has  observed  in  Bandahamy vs."
"Senanayake 62 NLR 313 (p.345) as follows;"
"“Two Judges sitting together also as a rule follow the decisions of two Judges. Where two"
"Judges sitting together find themselves unable to follow a decision of two Judges, the practice"
"in such cases is also to reserve the case for the decision of a fuller bench, although the Courts"
"Ordinance does not make express provision in that behalf as in case of a single Judge.”"
"In the circumstances, I am of the view that the questions raised by the Petitioner in the"
"instant  application  have  already  been  resolved  in  the  aforesaid  orders  of  this  Court."
"Therefore, based on the arguability principles that should be adopted in respect of matters"
"relating to issuance of notice in a juridical review application, I arrive at the conclusion"
"that there is no arguable case or a prima facie case for this Court to issue formal notice on"
"the Respondents in this application. Therefore, I proceed to refuse this application."
