"Respondents.  In  the  backdrop  of  the  above  orders  made  by  this  Court  and  upon  the"
"circumstances, the Court should be satisfied that there is a prima facie case that ought to"
"be resolved after full argument."
"The scope of section 168 and 169 of the Act"
"The question emanates from this application is whether the Petitioner is entitled to declare"
"the  budget  as  duly  adopted,  under  sections  168  &  169  of  the  Act,  based  on  the  alleged"
"reason that there were no alternative proposals presented by Members (apart from the 3"
"amendments  which  were  duly  considered  and  defeated)  and  also  on  the  basis  that  the"
"budget or any portion of it has not been neither modified nor rejected. It is observed that"
"the Petitioner has not afforded an opportunity for Members to take a vote on the budget"
"and  the  budget  he  has  tabled  is  relevant  to  a  period  after  the  first  two  years  since  the"
"commencement of the office of the Pradeshiya Sabha."
"I have already dealt with and determined similar questions relating to this application in;"
