"(the 5th Respondent) to the 1st Respondent for arbitration in terms of section 4(1) of the"
"Industrial Dispute Act, No. 43 of 1950 (as amended) (hereinafter referred to as the Act)."
"At  the  end  of  the  Arbitration  process  the  1st  Respondent  held  that  the  7th  added"
"Respondent should be entitled to an award of Rs. 200,000/- (document marked as P9)."
"After the award was published in the Gazette Notification marked as P10, the Petitioner"
"field  repudiation  papers  against  the  award.  By  P9,  the  1st  Respondent  ordered  the"
"Rekadahena Plantation (Pvt) Ltd to pay Rs. 200,000/= to the 7th added Respondent for"
"the mental injuria caused to him as a result of sudden ejectment from the quarters and"
"the damages caused to his furniture. One of the arguments of the learned Counsel for"
"the Petitioner is that under the labour legislation of the Country, an Arbitrator has no"
"power to grant  awards for mental injuria."
"In addition to the written submissions filed by the Petitioner, at the argument the learned"
"Counsel appearing for the Petitioner made a lengthy oral submission. On behalf of the"
"2nd - 5th Respondents the learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted to Court that he"
"is  ready  to  abide  by  any  decision  of  the  Court.  The  Petitioner  has  tendered  further"
"written submissions after the conclusion of the argument."
"One of the arguments of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that there are factual"
"errors in the ‘reference’ made by the Minster to the 1st Respondent for Arbitration and"
"even  though,  citing  those  errors  on  behalf  of  the  Petitioner  an  application  had  been"
"made before the commencement of the arbitration proceedings to the 1st Respondent to"
"re-refer the ‘reference’ to the Minsters to correct those errors,  the 1st  Respondent did"
"not allowed that application but commenced the inquiry on the defective  ‘reference’"
"and concluded the inquiry."
"Section 4(1) of the Act provides thus;"
"“the Minister may, if he is of the opinion that an industrial dispute is a minor dispute,"
"refer it, by an order in writing, for settlement by arbitration to an arbitrator appointed"
"by the Minister or to a labour tribunal, notwithstanding that the parties to such dispute"
"or their representatives do not consent to such reference.”"
"If there were any errors in the ‘reference’ made by the Minster to the 1st Respondent"
"and  if  the  Petitioner  was  not  satisfied  with  the  Order  made  by  the  1st  Respondent"
"regarding the preliminary objection raised on the ‘reference’, the Petitioner could have"
"taken  legal  actions  against  the  ‘reference’  and  the  Order  of  the  1st  Respondent."
