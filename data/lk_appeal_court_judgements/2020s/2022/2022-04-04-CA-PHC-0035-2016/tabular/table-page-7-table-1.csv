"In view of the aforesaid reasons, it is observable that the Appellants had not satisfied Court with"
"regard to the criterion embodied in Section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to consider"
"in revisionary proceedings such as, legality of any Order, propriety of any Order and regularity of"
"the proceedings of such Court."
"I
t appears that the Appellants had justified the delay of filing the impugned application for revision."
"W
e are of the view that the learned High Court Judge had analysed and evaluated the evidence"
"placed before the learned Magistrate and had affirmed the Order of the Magistrate, thus, the Order"
"of the learned High Court Judge is well founded."
"I
n this instance, it is submitted that, to exercise revisionary powers against the Order challenged,"
"it must be manifestly erroneous and needs to have occasioned a miscarriage of Justice, which goes"
"beyond an error, defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it and the"
"impugned Order, would have shocked the conscience of Court."
"A
pparently,  in  view  of  the  findings  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  the  Appellants  had  not"
"disclosed exceptional circumstances, which would warrant the intervention of the Provincial High"
"Court by way of an application for revision."
"T
hus, it clearly manifest that the learned High Court Judge had correctly affirmed the Order of the"
"learned Magistrate and had dismissed the Appellantsâ€™ application for revision. As such, we see no"
"reason for us to interfere with the Order dated 09.01.2013 by the learned High Court Judge and"
"the Order dated  15.09.2009  by the learned Magistrate. Hence, we dismiss the appeal  with  cost"
"fixed at Rs. 50,000/-."
