"E.R.S.R.Coomaraswamy  on  The  Law  of  Evidence  -  Vol.01,  at  page  469"
"states about the probative value of such evidence in the following manner;"
"“The  probative  value  of  dying  declarations  relevant  under  section32(1)"
"would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But there is no"
"doubt  that  such  evidence  suffers  from  certain  intrinsic  infirmities.  Two  of"
"these defects are the fact that the statement was not made under oath and"
"the absence of cross-examination of the deponent of the statement."
"It  has,  therefore,  been  held  by  our  courts  that  the  jury  should  be  told.  In"
"assessing  the  value  of  the  dying  declaration,  they  should  consider  these"
"infirmities and certain other matters peculiar to this type of evidence.”"
