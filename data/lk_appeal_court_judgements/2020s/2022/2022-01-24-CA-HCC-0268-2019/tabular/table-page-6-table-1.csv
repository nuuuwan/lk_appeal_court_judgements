"important  omissions  of  PW-06  in  her  evidence  in  relation  to  the  evidence  she"
"gave before the Magistrate Court and in the Police statement."
"It  was  the  submission  of  the 
learned  Senior  State  Counsel 
(SSC) 
for  the"
"Attorney General that there cannot be any doubt that the deceased had in fact"
"made the dying declaration in writing while receiving treatment at the hospital."
"However,  giving  consideration  to  the  submissions  made  with  regard  to  the"
"reliability  of  the  evidence  of  PW-02,  and  the  prosecutions  failure  to  call  the"
"relevant  material  witnesses,  she 
invited  the  Court  to  consider  the  appeal"
"accordingly."
"Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal: -"
"As there is evidence of an eye witness apart from the alleged dying declarations"
"of the deceased, I now proceed to consider whether the evidence of PW-02 was"
"reliable enough for the learned trial judge to accept her evidence as an accurate"
"description of what happened between her father and the mother at the time of"
"the incident."
"Before  drawing  my  attention  to  the  reasons  given  in  that  regard,  I  find  it"
"relevant to consider the fact that the learned High Court judge has decided that"
"it  was  highly  dangerous  to  act  on  the  evidence  of  the  mother  of  the  deceased"
"namely,  Swarnalatha, 
(PW-06)  on 
the  basis 
that  her  evidence  was  not"
"trustworthy. It has been determined that the witness’s failure to mention in the"
"Police statement or at the non-summary inquiry that her daughter told her in"
"the  evening  of  the  incident  that  the  appellant  threatened  her  with  death  and"
"wanted  her 
to 
follow 
them 
to 
the 
rented  house  as  materially 
relevant."
"Furthermore,  the 
failure  of  the  witness  to  mention  to  the  Police  that  her"
"daughter informed her that it was her husband who set fire to her while being"
"transported to the hospital also has been considered among other infirmities in"
"her evidence to disregard her evidence."
"The learned High Court judge in his judgment at page 21 (page 390 of the brief)"
"has correctly concluded that the child’s evidence cannot be assessed as that of"
"an adult, and also the fact that since the child is living with her grandmother"
