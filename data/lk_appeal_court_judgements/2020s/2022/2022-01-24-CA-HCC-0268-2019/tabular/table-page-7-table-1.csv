"after  the  incident,  her  mind  may  have  been  contaminated  with  what  is  often"
"discussed  about  the  incident  to  believe  that  she  actually  saw  the  incident  in"
"that  way.  He  has  also  drawn  his  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  child  was  even"
"unable to understand the questions asked in Court in some instances at page"
"22  of  the  judgment  (page  391  of  the  brief),  but  has  concluded  that  it  has  not"
"caused any effect on the trustworthiness of her evidence."
"It  has  been  considered  that  the  child  was  unable  to  describe  what  happened"
"when she was examined by the doctor one year after the incident. The learned"
"High  Court  judge  has  considered  that,  if  she  was  unable  to  describe  what"
"happened  one  year  after  the  incident,  how  it  was  possible  for  her  to  give  a"
"Police  statement 
in 
the  manner 
it  has  been  recorded,  since 
it  was 
the"
"contention  of 
the  defence 
that 
it  was  a  concocted  story  recorded  at 
the"
"instigation  of  the  Police  and  the  relatives  of  the  deceased.  The  fact  that  the"
"female  Police  officer  who  gave  evidence  at  the  trial  has  had  a  relationship"
"beyond her official commitments with the deceasedâ€™s family and the child  has"
"also attracted the attention of the learned trial judge."
"The  attention  has  also  been  drawn 
to 
the  observations  of 
the 
learned"
"Magistrate  before  whom  the  non-summary  inquiry  was  conducted.  When  the"
"statement made by the child to Police was read over to her, she has not been in"
"a position to confirm the statement and the learned Magistrate has decided not"
"to proceed with the recording of her evidence any further. It has been observed"
"that  there  was  no  use  in  recording  her  evidence  as  she  was  confused  and"
"unable to relate the facts properly."
"However, after considering all the above-mentioned negatives of the evidence of"
"the child, the learned High Court judge has decided that it was the Magistrate"
"who  has  been  confused  in  making  the  observations,  apparently  based  on  the"
"observations  of  the  learned  Magistrate  before  he  commenced  the  recording  of"
"the evidence proper, that the child appears to be a competent witness because"
"of the answers given by her to his questioning."
