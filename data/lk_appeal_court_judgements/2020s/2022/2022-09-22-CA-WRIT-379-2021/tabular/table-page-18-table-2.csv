"2010) UKSC 58 has drawn his attention to the following passage in the case of IRC vs."
"Metro lands (Property Finance) Limited (1981) 2 All ER 166 ;"
"“When considering the extent to which a deeming provision should be applied, the court"
"is entitled and bound to ascertain for what purposes and between what persons the statutory"
"fiction is to be resorted to. It will not always be clear what those purposes are. If the application"
"of  the  provision  would  lead  to  an  unjust,  anomalous  or  absurd  result  then,  unless  its"
"application  would  clearly  be  within  the  purposes  of  the  fiction,  it  should  not  be  applied.”"
"(Emphasis added)"
