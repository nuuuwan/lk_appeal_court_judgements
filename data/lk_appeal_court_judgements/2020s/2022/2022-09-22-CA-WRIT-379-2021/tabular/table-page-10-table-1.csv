"to be interdicted pending a preliminary investigation under the provisions of the said Code."
"The Petitioner  referring  to  Para  18:7  of  Chapter  XXII  of  the  Code  asserts  that  the said"
"Section does not provide for ‘relieving’ a person from their duties but rather stipulates that"
"if a person should not exercise the functions of his office in the interest of an investigation"
"or inquiry, then he should be transferred or placed on compulsory leave in terms of Para"
"14 of Chapter X. In view of such submissions the Petitioner contends that the decision to"
"relieve her from her duties has been made without any legal authority and such decision"
"can be declared a nullity."
"The  other  important  facet  of  the  Petitioner’s  argument  is  that  the  decision  to  relive  the"
"Petitioner from her duties is devoid of any reasoning and it is only at the stage of filing the"
"statement of objections (in this application) that the Respondents have divulged the reason"
"for relieving the Petitioner from her duties and apparently it was ‘to facilitate conducting"
"of an impartial investigation’."
"As opposed to such arguments, the Respondent’s contention is that although the section"
"51 of the Act has provided for removal of the Head of the Department, no procedure for"
"such removal has been mentioned and/or prescribed. The Respondents contend therefore,"
"that the University has embarked on conducting disciplinary proceedings adhering to the"
"rules of natural justice to ascertain, according to law, whether there are any strong grounds"
"to establish the allegations put forward against the Petitioner in respect of her functions as"
"the  Head/Department.  The  Respondents  further  submit  that  although  there  is  no  clear"
"provision in the Act or in the Code to deal with allegations against the Head/Department"
"in respect of alleged misbehaviour or misuse of authority, it is the common understanding"
"that a reasonable, valid procedure should be followed to remove the Head/Department;"
"and the said Act cannot provide for each and every step of the administrative action of a"
"university."
"The Respondents argue that the post of academic Head/Department is not a permanent"
"post and it is only a temporary administrative post; and further, such position is the same"
"in relation to the Vice Chancellor and the Deans of Faculties. The Act only provides for"
"the appointment and the removal of a Head/Department whereas, no procedure for such"
"removal has been laid down. In  that context the Respondents allege that the procedure"
"stipulated in Chapter XXII of the Code has been considered as the most suitable procedure"
"to be followed in determining the allegations against the Petitioner."
