"provision comes into operation where a Head/Department retires or resigns or is for other"
"reasons unable to perform duties of his office. It appears that the 31st Respondent has been"
"serving  as  an  Acting  Head/Department  for  a  period  over  three  months.  What  needs"
"consideration in the instant application is whether the said deeming provision  becomes"
"operative even on a reason where a higher authority takes a decision, pending an inquiry,"
"against the wish of such Head/Department, preventing him/her from performing duties"
"of the post of Head/Department. In other words, the question is whether such deeming"
"provision is applicable to this case as the 31st Respondent has been serving as the Acting"
"Head/Department for a period over three months."
