"The  victim  was  12  years  old  when  he  gave  evidence  before  the  court.  His"
"family  was  scattered  when  his  mother  went  abroad  for  employment.  After"
"his mother left, his aunt brought him to Colombo and admitted him to the"
"children’s’  home  situated 
in  Thalahena.  He  had 
then  commenced  his"
"schooling  from  there.  Several  other  children  were  also  living  there.  Two"
"persons  had  been  working  in  the  said  home.  Two  young  girls  who  were"
"working  there  also  had  left  during  that  period.  Hence,  he  had  been  called"
"upon to assist in the kitchen."
"One  day  the  Appellant  called  the  victim  to  the  kitchen  in  early  hours  and"
"entrusted  him 
to  scraping  coconut 
in 
the  kitchen.  This 
is  when 
the"
"Appellant had taken advantage of the victim as stated before. Only he and"
"the Appellant were in the kitchen at that time. Other children were sleeping"
"when this incident happened to him."
"He  had  revealed  this  incident  to  his  friends  at  the  children’s  house  and"
"they  had  in  turn  mentioned  this  to  the  people  who  have  come  to  do  the"
"repair of the building during that time. The said workers had then informed"
"this to the Rev. Father in charge of the children’s home and had filed a case"
"against the Appellant. After 4-5 days the Appellant had quit the job and left"
"the place."
"One  day  after  leaving  the  children’s  home,  the  Appellant  had  gone  to  the"
"victim’s  school  and  slapped  him 
in 
front  of  his  teacher.  Thereafter,  a"
"complaint  had  been  lodged  at  the  police  station  and  the  victim  had  been"
"subjected to a medical examination."
"In 
the  cross  examination 
the  victim  had  given  evidence  without  any"
"contradictions  or  omissions.  When  the  incident  happened,  he  was  only  8"
"years old. But his evidence was quite consistent and clearly implicated the"
"Appellant. He denied that the persons who accompanied him to the police"
