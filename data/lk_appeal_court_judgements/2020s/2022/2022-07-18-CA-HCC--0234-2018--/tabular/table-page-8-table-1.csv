"manner  as  the  accused  did.  Our  Courts  were  reluctant  to  take"
"into  consideration  any  special  circumstances  which  manifested"
"in the particular offender's case.”"
"Kulatilaka J further held that:"
"“Of  late  we  observe  a  development  in  other  jurisdictions  where"
"Courts  and  juries  have  taken  a  more  pragmatic  view  of  the"
"mitigatory  plea  of  provocation.  In  a  series  of  cases  in  applying"
"the mitigatory plea of provocation Courts took into consideration"
"the  prior  course  of  relationship  between  the  accused  and  his"
"victim.”"

the  plea  of  grave  and  sudden  provocation  an"
"accused  is  entitled  to  rely  upon  a  series  of  prior  events  that"
"ultimately led to the incident at which the death was caused. A"
"court  should  not  restrict  its  focus  to  an  isolated  incident  that"
"resulted in the death, in considering a plea of grave and sudden"
"provocation. The aforementioned jurisprudence has widened the"
"scope of this plea by expanding the limitations recognised in its"

Thereby,

‘Continuing’

"‘Cumulative’ provocation has been recognised  as  a plea coming"

"recognised  under  Exception  –  1,  section  294  of  the  Penal  Code."
"Therefore, the proximity of time between the “actus reus” of the"
