"9.","It is the contention of the learned State Counsel for the complainant"
"","appellant  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to  consider"
"","the  prescribed  minimum  mandatory  sentence  for 
the  offence  in"
"","count No.5. The learned State Counsel further submitted that in the"
"","given aggravating circumstances, the sentence should be much more"
"","than 
the  prescribed  minimum  sentence  of 
imprisonment  and  a"
"","deterrent custodial sentence is warranted."
"10. It  is  the  submission  of  the  learned  State  Counsel  that  the  Judge’s",""
"","discretion 
to  deviate 
from 
the  minimum  mandatory 
sentence"
"","mentioned in the decided judicial precedence should not be applied"

"","offences  were  committed  about 
fifteen  years  ago.  The 
learned"
"","President’s Counsel submitted that adequate compensation has been"
"","ordered 
in 
the  civil  case  by

that  not  only 
the  accused  respondents  but  also

"","prescribing a minimum mandatory sentence in section 364(2) (e) of"
"","the Penal Code is in conflict with Articles 4 (c), 11 and 12(1) of the"

"","sentence  that  is  deemed  appropriate  in  the  exercise  of  its  judicial"
