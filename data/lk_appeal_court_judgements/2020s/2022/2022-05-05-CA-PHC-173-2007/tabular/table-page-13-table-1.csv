"no decision‚Äù."
"W
hat the Petitioners had been given in case No.541/2008 will not be fruitful if they fail in the"
"present case. As discussed above, there was a legitimate expectation that the Petitioners will be"
"given  a  pension.  According  to  the  Gazette  mentioned  above,  the  positions  they  held  were"
"pensionable."
"T
he final question is whether the Respondents had a legal obligation and violated the same. The"
"Respondents  were  officials  who  held  the  responsibility  of  the  employment  and  governing"
"authority regarding the Petitioners."
"T
herefore,  they  were  responsible  for  absorbing  the  Petitioners  from  the  7th  Respondent  into"
"provincial service. Their duty was to absorb and act according to the Gazette and issue proper"
"employment letters. The legal obligation violated by the Respondents was that they had not issued"
"proper  letters  of  employment.  As  officials  of  the  Provincial  Government  of  North  Central"
"Province, the Respondents have a public duty to exercise their powers regarding the Petitioners."
"T
he  Petitioners  were  given  an  opportunity  to  state  what  category  they  would  choose  in  the"
"document marked [P5]. All correspondents marked in this case, which made the Chief Engineer"
"to write the document marked [P5], indicate the right of the Petitioners had to invoke a Writ of"
"Mandamus."
"T
he right is a legal right created by legitimate expectation that they will be absorbed into a service"
"described under clause 3 of the document marked [P5]. Therefore, the Petitioners have given a"
"legal right and not a right of equitable nature."
"A
nother point on which the Respondents based their argument is the misrepresentation of facts."
"Perusing the documents of the Respondents,  there was  nothing to  prove their argument. Mere"
"stating a fact cannot be considered without proof; therefore, I presume that the Petitioners had not"
"misrepresented any material fact in this case."
