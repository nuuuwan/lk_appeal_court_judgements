"The  Learned  Counsel  for  the  2nd  accused-appellant  argued  that  the 
learned  trial  Judge  has"
"misdirected herself by wrongly applying the decided case of AG vs. Joseph Aloysious and another"
"1992 (2) SLR 264. The said judgment does not permit or allow the investigation officers to show a"
"suspect to a victim before the identification parade who are intended to go before an identification"
"parade."
"It  was  held  in  the  above-mentioned  case  that  the  identity  of  the  accused,  as  a  person  who"
"committed the offence, is a fact in issue at a criminal trial and evidence as to the identification of"
"the accused by a witness, is relevant and admissible."
"The  first  statutory  provision  regarding  the  holding  of  identification  parades  were  contained  in"
"section 74(1) of the Administration of Justice Law No. 44 of 1973. This, provision was reproduced"
"verbatim in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, as section 124. But even without"
"specific statutory provisions authorising such procedure, identification parades were held as a step"
"in the process of investigation."
"An Identification parade is a means by which evidence of identity is obtained. But it is certainly not"
"the only means by which it could be established that a witness identified the accused as the person"
"who committed the offence. Identification can take place, depending on the circumstances, even"
"where  in  the  course  of  an  investigation  the  witness  points  out  the  person  who  committed  the"
"offence to the police. That evidence too would be relevant and admissible subject however to any"
"statutory provision that may specifically exclude it at the trial."
