"transaction  with  the  local  branch  office  that  gave  rise  to  the  payment  for"
"services rendered in Sri Lanka."
"[
78] The total commission income received from all eight companies in foreign"
"currency, 
including 
from  Mabey  &  Johnson  Ltd,  UK  as  per  A15 
is  Rs."
"144,570,400.94,  which 
is  clearly  stated 
in 
the 
financial  statement  of 
the"
"Appellant  (p.  15).  After  deducting  a  sum  of  Rs.  587,030  as  direct  expenses,"
"the Appellant claimed a sum of Rs. 143,983,371 as commission income under"
"section 13 (dddd) of the Act (p. 15 of the TAC brief and the return of income)."
"The  Assessor  has  not  disputed 
the  detailed 
information  provided  by 
the"
"Appellant 
in 
respect  of 
the  agency  commission 
received 
from  Mabey  &"
"Johnson  Ltd,  UK  or  the  indent/consultancy  commission  received  from  seven"

"[79]  During 
the  course  of 
the  argument, 
the 
learned  Additional  Solicitor"
"General  submitted  that  the  Appellant  had  paid  VAT  out  of  the  commission"
"income received by the Appellant and therefore, the Appellantis not entitled to"
"claim 
the 
tax  exemption  under  section  13  (dddd).  This  seems 
to  be 
the"
"identical stand taken by the Commissioner, referring to section 7 (1)(C) of the"
"VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002 in its determination at pp. 7-8 of the TAC brief. The"
"view  of  the  Commissioner  was  that  the  payment  of  VAT  proves  that  the"
"service  has  been  consumed  and  utilized 
in  Sri  Lanka  and 
therefore, 
the"
"person to whom the service was rendered was a person in Sri Lanka."
"[80]  It  is relevant  to note  that  the  question  in  the present  case  is whether or"
"not the Appellant provided any service to Mabey & Johnson Ltd, UK and other"
"companies  within  the  meaning  of  section  13  (dddd)  of  the  Inland  Revenue"
"Act.  Section  7(1)(c)  of  the  VAT  Act  relied  on  by  the  Commissioner  reads  as"
"follows:"
"“Any  other  service,  being  a  service  not  referred  to  in  paragraph  (b),"
"provided by any person in Sri Lanka to another person outside Sri Lanka"
"to  be  consumed  or  utilized  outside  Sri  Lanka  shall  be  zero  rated"
"provided 
that  payment 
for  such  service 
in 
full  has  been  received 
in"
"foreign currency from outside Sri Lanka through a bank in Sri Lanka”"
"[
81]  In  terms  of  section  7(1)(c)  of  the  VAT  Act,  any  supply  to  be  treated  as"
"zero rated supply, has to be consumed or utilized outside Sri Lanka and the"
"receipts  should  be  remitted  to  Sri  Lanka.  Whereas,  there  is  no  requirement"
"under  section  13  (dddd),  either  to  consume  or  utilize  the  service  outside  Sri"
"Lanka  as  the  words  “to  be  consumed  or  utilized  outside  Sri  Lanka”  are  not"
"found  in  section  13  (dddd)  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act.    Significantly,  section"
"13 (dddd) only provides “the profits and income earned in foreign currency by"
"any resident company, any resident individual or any partnership in Sri Lanka"
"from  any  service 
rendered 
in  or  outside  Sri  Lanka, 
to  any  person  or"
"partnership  outside  Sri  Lanka…”.  Where  it  is  proved  that  the  Appellant"
