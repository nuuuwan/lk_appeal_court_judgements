"I
t  is  seen  that,  the  learned  Judge  of  the  High  Court  of  Sabaragamuwa  Province  (holden  in"
"Ratnapura) had obviously followed the Judgment of The Superitendent, Stafford Estate & Two"
"others Vs. Solaimuthu Rasu [supra], which is a writ application. However, as many Judgments"
"and  authorities  have  held,  the  High  Court  acting  under  Article  138  of  the  Constitution,  has"
"jurisdiction to try and hear revision applications relating to State lands."
"I
t is relevant to note that the ratio decidendi of the Judgment in Solaimuthu Rasu’s case, which"
"held that the Provincial High Court, had no jurisdiction to issue writs under Article 154P (4) of the"
"Constitution pertaining to State lands."
"I
n order for the Provincial High Courts to exercise writ jurisdiction, the issue should be one that"
"falls within the purview of the Provincial Council list. Since the subject-State lands does not fall"
"within the purview of the Provincial Council list, Provincial High Court is not empowered to issue"
"writs under Article 154P (4) of the Constitution in respect of matters pertaining to State lands."
"A
ccording  to Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution, which stipulates  that,  “Every such High"
"Court shall notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any Law, exercise appellate and"
"revisionary  jurisdiction  in  respect  of  convictions,  sentences  and  orders  entered  or  imposed  by"
"Magistrate’s Courts and Primary Courts within the province”."
"I
t is noteworthy that revisionary jurisdiction in terms of Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution,"
"has not excluded the power to exercise appellate or revisionary jurisdiction regarding State lands."
"I
t is observable that the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction"
"of the Provincial High Court of Ratnapura in terms of Article 154P (3) (b), and not under Article"
"154P (4) of the Constitution."
"T
herefore,  it  appears  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  misconstrued  the  Articles  of  the"
"Constitution and also relied on the Judgment of ‘Solaimuthu Rasu’ expressing his view that any"
"matter relating to State lands could not be reviewed in any manner in the Provincial High Court."
"As such, it is apparent that the Order made by the learned High Court Judge dismissing the revision"
"application made by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant  is  made  per  incuriam. Therefore, the"
"impugned Order dated 20.09.2017 made by the learned High Court Judge is set aside."
