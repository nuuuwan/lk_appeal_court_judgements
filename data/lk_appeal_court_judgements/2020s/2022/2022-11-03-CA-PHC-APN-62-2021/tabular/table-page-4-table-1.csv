"Aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner had moved to this court seeking leave to appeal against"
"the judgment of the High Court Judge of Homagama."
"In this  order,  I consider submissions made on behalf of the parties  and the High Court Judge's"
"judgment dated 23.03, 2021."
"The Petitioner had argued that he had been carrying on business for twenty-five years and had kept"
"a clear record. Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau awarded him the highest grade in 2012 and"
"2014. His goodwill was not taken into consideration at the trial. Perusing his written submissions"
"dated 17.07.2020 to  the High Court, there is  no mention  of such an issue. Therefore,  the High"
"Court Judge cannot consider what was not argued."
"When  perusing  the  judgment,  the  learned  Judge  had  discussed  every  aspect  of  the  Petitioner's"
"appeal.  One  argument  was  that  the  employment  agreement  period  was  only  two  years.  The"
"prosecution can charge only regarding that period and not what happened afterwards."
