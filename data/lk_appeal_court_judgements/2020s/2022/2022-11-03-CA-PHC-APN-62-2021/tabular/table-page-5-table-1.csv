"The legislature introduced this Act mainly to safeguard employees working abroad and to ensure"
"their safety. Therefore, when the period is not mentioned strictly, the liability runs even beyond"
"the period of two years. The reasonings of the learned High Court Judge are clearly according to"
"the law."
"Another aspect argued by the Petitioner before the High Court was regarding the employee (P.W.2)"
"running away from the employer and meeting  an embassy official. Rightfully the learned High"
"Court Judge had concluded that the learned Magistrate had properly evaluated this evidence. If the"
"accused (Petitioner) is bringing such a position as a ground of defence, not only his word, he should"
"be able to call witnesses before the court."
