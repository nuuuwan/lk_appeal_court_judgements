"Even  under  those  circumstances,  there  are  the  above  contradictions"
"that affect the credibility of the evidence of PW1.  A case does  not fail"
"merely  because  there  are  some  infirmities  and  inconsistencies.  If  the"

"court could have examined whether this is a true story and whether the"
"infirmities  or  inconsistencies  affect  the  credibility  of  the  prosecution"
"case. Since the prosecution has decided that the case could be proved"
"beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  with  the  evidence  of  one  witness,  that"
"opportunity  has  been  lost.  The  above  contradictions  go  to  the  root  of"
"the case because the raid has been organized on the said questionable"
"information received. The aforesaid major contradictions regarding the"
"information  affect  the  truthfulness  of  the  prosecution  story.  In  the"
"circumstances, the PW1’s evidence could not be considered as cogent"

"Judge’s finding that the evidence of PW1 is cogent is not correct."
