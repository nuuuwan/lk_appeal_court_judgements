"In perusing the aforesaid order, it appears that the learned High Court"
"Judge has pre-determined what the defence witness would state if he"
"was  called  in  evidence.  By  pre-determining  so,  the  learned  Judge"
"decided that his evidence is not necessary. I am of the view that this is"
"not only a denial of a fair trial but also an observation that should not"
"be made by the learned Judge in adjudicating the case impartially."
