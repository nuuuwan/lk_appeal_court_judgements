"for the respondent made oral submissions at the hearing."
"T
he  main  complaint  of 
the 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for  both"
"appellants  was  that  the  appellants  were  denied  a  fair  trial  by  not"
"allowing  them  to  call  the  defence  witness  that  they  wanted  to  call  to"
"substantiate the defence version. The learned State Counsel submitted"
"that for the reasons stated by the learned High Court Judge in her order"
"dated 26.09.2018, and for the purpose of preventing unnecessary delay,"
"the application to call the last witness for the defence was disallowed"
"and there is nothing wrong in the said order. The learned State Counsel"
"contended 
further,  anyhow,  that 
it 
is  not  a  reason  to  vitiate  the"
"convictions."
"I
t is to be noted first that Section 4(d) of the “International Covenant on"
"Civil  and  Political  Rights  (ICCPR)  Act  No.  56  of  2007  ”  states  that  “a"
"person  charged  of  a  criminal  offence  under  any  written  law  shall  be"
"entitled to examine or to have examined the witnesses against him and"
"to  obtain  the  attendance  of  witnesses  on  his  behalf,  under  the  same"
"conditions as witnesses called against him”."
"H
owever, the learned High Court Judge has not given the aforesaid right"
"to the appellants of this case. Now, it is important to see why the said"
"right  was  not  given  by  the  learned  Judge.  Reasons  are  stated  in  her"
"judgment.  The  learned  Judge  has  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the"
"evidence relating to the misconduct of PW1 is not required in this case."
"If the appellants wanted to question the acts of misconduct of PW1, the"
"learned  Judge  was  of  the  view  that  those  questions  could  have  been"
"asked when the PW1 was cross-examined. Stating these reasons, the"
"learned  Judge  refused  the  application  to  call  the  OIC  of  the  Police"
"Narcotic Bureau as a defence witness."
