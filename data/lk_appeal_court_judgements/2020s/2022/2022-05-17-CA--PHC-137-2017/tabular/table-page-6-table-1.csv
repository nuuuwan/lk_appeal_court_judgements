"768/P and seek permission of the Primary Court to adjust the terms of the settlement and staying"
"the execution of writ until such time a fresh partition action has been instituted."
"C
ourt observes that the Appellants had withdrawn the said partition case bearing No. 768/P on"
"28.05.2003 with liberty to file a fresh action. The Appellants had not taken any interest in filing a"
"fresh partition action until the Respondent moved Court to execute the writ, which was after 10"
"years from the date of withdrawal of the said partition case.  Thus, it is imperative to note that the"
"Appellants have not exercised their legal rights over the disputed property and had not acted upon"
"with due diligence."
"T
hus, according to the maxim ‘vigilantibus non dormientibus aequitas subvenit’, the Appellants"
"had slept over their rights. The law helps the vigilant and not those who sleep over their rights.  In"
"view of the  aforementioned reasons,  it is  seen that the learned High Court  Judge  has correctly"
"decided that no exceptional circumstances have been established by the Appellants to invoke the"
"revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court. Since there is no miscarriage of justice caused to the"
"Appellants, no exceptional circumstances exist for Court to exercise the discretionary remedy in"
"favour of the Appellants."
"H
ence, we see no reason for us to interfere with the Order made by the learned High Court Judge."
"Thus, the appeal is dismissed with cost."
