"of Matale in the Board of Quazis on 14.10.2016 which is also"
"prior   to   the   said   letter   of   transfer   of   the   Judicial   Service"
"Commission dated 04.11.2016. Therefore, it is apparent that"
"the  direction  issued  by  the  Judicial  Service   Commission   to"
"transfer   the   case   from   the   Quazi   Court   of   Matale   to   the"
"Quazi Court of Mawanella was issued while the appeal was"
"pending before the Board of Quazis. In other words, when"
"the Judicial Service Commission issued the said direction of"
"transfer the case to the Quazi Court of Mawanella, there was"
"no case proceedings before the Quazi Court of Matale and"
"the   matter   was   well   adjudicated   by   the   learned   Quazi"
"according   to   law.   There   were   no   impediments   for   the"
"learned Quazi of Matale to hear and determine the case. In"
"my   view,
  the   said   direction   of
  the  
Judicial
  Service"
"Commission   dated   04.11.2016   cannot
  be   effectuated"
"retrospectively   to   invalidate   the   impugned   Order   of   the"
"learned Quazi. Unwittingly, the Judicial Service Commission"
"proceeded   to   take   the   matter   out   of   the   former   Quazi"
"without   knowing   the   fact   that   the   said   learned   Quazi"
"adjudicated the case according to law. As such, if this Court"
"concede the position taken by the learned Counsel for the"
"Petitioner   that   –   “when   the   transfer   is   effected   by   the"
"Judicial   Service   Commission,   any   proceedings   including"
"orders whatsoever made is to be set aside”, I am afraid, this"
"sort   of   defence   may   amount   to   an   abuse   of   the   legal"
"process. In future, any party or person interested in a Quazi"
"proceeding,
  without
  participating  
in   any  
inquiry   or"
"dishonouring   Quazi   Court’s   notices,   soon   before   delivering"
"an   order,   may   simply   make   an   application   to   the   Judicial"
