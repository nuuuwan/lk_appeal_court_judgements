"the first-mentioned Quazi in  respect  of  the  matter  to"

"The  
learned   Counsel   for   the   Petitioner   by   appending"
"document marked X, X1 (vide motion dated 20.09.2019), Y"
"and Y1 (vide motion dated 21.10.2019) submitted that, upon"
"the Petitioner’s request, the Judicial Service Commission by"
"its  
letter
  dated   04.11.2016  
transferred  
the   present"
"proceeding to the Quazi Court of Mawanella from the Quazi"
"Court of Matale. Thus, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner"
"contended   that
 the   learned   Quazi   for   Matale   has   no"
"jurisdiction   to   hear   and   determine   the   case   and   the   said"
"proceedings   to   be   set   aside   forthwith,   soon   after   the"

"Service   Commission   to   hear   the   matter.  Accordingly,   the"
"learned Counsel for the Petitioner took up the position  that"
"as   the   matter   was   transferred   from   the   Quazi   Court   of"
"Matale   to   the   Quazi   Court   of   Mawanella,   the   Order   of   the"
"Quazi Court of Matale is of no effect. The learned Counsel"
"for   the   Petitioner,   in   the   course   of   the   argument   further"
"contended  that,  when   the   transfer   is   effected   by   Judicial"
"Service   Commission,   any   proceedings   including   Orders"
"whatsoever made is to be set aside."
"However, it is to be noted that the impugned Order of the"
"Quazi   Court   for   Matale   which   was   challenged   by   the"
"Petitioner in the Board of Quazis was made on 17.09.2016,"
"prior to the letter of transfer (appointment of new Quazi) of"
"the Judicial Service Commission (vide document marked X)."
"The Petitioner challenged the said Order of the Quazi Court"
