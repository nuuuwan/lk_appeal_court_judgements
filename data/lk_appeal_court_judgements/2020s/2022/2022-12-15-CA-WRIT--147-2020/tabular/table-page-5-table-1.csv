"authority and the relevant officers of the relevant local authority, but, the presence of the"
"representative of the UDA is a mandatory requirement for the said purpose."
"On a perusal of the relevant applicable laws, it appears that the delegatee (in this"
"case  the  relevant  officer  of  the  Homagama  Pradeshiya  Sabha)  when  exercising  or"
"discharging any power, duty, or function delegated to it, it must do so under the direction,"
"supervision,  and  control  of  the  Urban  Development  Authority.  The  delegatee  cannot"
"exercise those powers at their own will. If it does, the decisions or actions would be null"
"and void as they are ultra vires."
"In the instant case, there are two documents on the record, one submitted by the"
"Petitioner (“P12”) and one submitted by the Respondents (“R15”) that demonstrate that"
"the decision of the Respondents, as evinced in the impugned letter, are not proprio vigore."
"With regard to the former, the Statement of Objections states thus:"
"“The  2nd  Respondent  sent  the  letter  dated  06-03-2020  to  the  Director  of  the  Urban"
"Development Authority which is marked P12 with the Petition of the Petitioner seeking necessary"
"advise to take steps to cancel the approvals already granted including the Petitioner’s since Urban"
"Development Authority is the appropriate authority to act in respect of granting and cancellation"
"of the approvals for development purposes.” [emphasis added]"
"In the latter (“R15”) the Director (Western Province) of the UDA, by letter dated"
"16th July 2020, in response to “P12”, requests the Secretary of the Homagama Pradeshiya"
"Sabha  to  discuss  the  reasons  for  revoking  the  approvals  at  the  Planning  Committee"
"meeting and to forward the same to the UDA in order for it to instruct whether to revoke"
"the approvals. The relevant portion of this letter reads:"
"“ඒ  අනුව  අදොළ  උ තදස්  ලබොදීම  ස හො  අදොළ  අනුමැතීන්  ලබොදීතම්දී  සලකො  බලන  කරුණු  සහ  එම"
"අනුමැතීන්  අවලංගු කිරීම ස හො  ොදක කර ත හැකි කරුණු පිළිබ ව සැලසුම් කමිටුතේ සොකච්චො කර එම ත ොනු"
"අධිකොරිය තවත ලබො තදන තලස තමයින් දන්වො සිටිමි.”"
"Thus, there has been no decision to revoke or cancel the permit yet, or rather, there"
"is  nothing  before  us  to  demonstrate  the  same.  The  ‘decisions’  communicated  in  the"
"impugned letter have not been made under the supervision or direction or control of the"
"UDA.  Therefore,  they  cannot  be  deemed  to  be  decisions  proprio  vigore.  It  is  merely  a"
"communication to the UDA. To use the words of his Lordship Sharvananda J. (as he then"
"was) in Fernando v. Jayaratne 78 NLR 123, this ‘decision’ “has no binding force; it is not"
"a step in consequence of which legally enforceable rights may be created or extinguished”."
"As this Court does not possess a magical crystal ball to predict the future course of action"
