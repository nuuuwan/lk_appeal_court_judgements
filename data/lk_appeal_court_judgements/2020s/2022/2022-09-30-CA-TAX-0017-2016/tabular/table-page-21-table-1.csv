"handled or promoted sales in the names of its subsidiary. Paragraph 11 of the"
"Appellant’s written submissions (p. 18 of the TAC brief) reads as follows:"
"“However,  company  did  not  receive  any  commission  from  Lanka  Walltile"
"Meepe (Pvt) Ltd for the goods, the company purchased for their own use."
"The goods purchased has been exported by the company  under the"
"in 
this 
instance, 
the  company  has  not 
company’s  name.  Therefore,"
"handled or promoted sales in the name of Lanka Walltile Meepe (Pvt) Ltd”."
"[65]  Contrary 
to 
the  Appellant’s  position 
taken  before 
the  Commissioner"
"General of Inland Revenue, that the “goods purchased had been exported by"
"the 
the  company  under 
the  company’s  name”,  paragraphs  1  and47  of"
"Appellant’s  written  submission  filed  on  10.05.2018  state  that  the  Appellant"
"purchased wall tiles from Lanka Walltiles Meepe Ltd to fulfil part of its export"
"orders which are classed in the statement of accounts. Paragraph 51reads as"
"follows:"
"“51- In a separate transaction, the Appellant also purchased wall tiles from"
"Lanka Walltile Meepe (Pvt) Ltd to fulfill part of its export orders which are"
"classified as purchases in the intercompany accounts”."
"[66]  Based  on  the  Appellant’s  own  written  submission,  it  is  clear  that  only  a"
"part  of  the  sales  from  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd.  had  been  exported  by  the"
"Appellant  and  the  other  part  would  have  fallen 
into 
local  sales  of  Lanka"
"Walltile Meepe Ltd."
"[
67] The question also arises whether the phrase “local sales” is restricted to"
"commission  paid  for  selling  tiles  manufactured  by  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd"
"for  the  purpose  of  selling  them  to  third  parties,  through  the  Appellant’s  own"
"channels and  sales outlets.  In  this context, it  is necessary  to understand  the"
"nature  of 
the  commercial  arrangement  between 
the  Appellant  and 
its"
"subsidiary  company,  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd,  and 
the 
factors  and 
the"
"circumstances that motivated the parties to earn a profitable income  through"
"this transaction, in addition to its core business activities."
"[68]  According  to  the Board Paper dated  24.10.2008, a  sales  commission of"
"5%  is  to  be  paid  by  Lanka Walltile  Meepe  Ltd,  to  Lanka Walltile  PLC  on  its"
"local sales gross value for (a) using Lanka Walltile brand; (b) handling and"
"promoting  sales  through  the  Appellant’s  sales  channels;  and  (c)  using  the"
"customer  base  of 
the  Appellant.  Though 
the  Appellant  claims 
that 
the"
"commission income (70,686,000) was received for selling tiles manufactured"
"by  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd  through  its  local  outlets  to  third  parties,  as  its"
"agent,  and  it  was  a  distinct  transaction  from  purchases  made  from  Lanka"
"Walltile  Meepe  Ltd,  no  document  has  been  produced  by  the  Appellant  to"
"identify such local sales made by the Appellant through its sales outlet to third"
"parties other than the Board Paper and the Resolution."
