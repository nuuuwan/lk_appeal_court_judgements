"with the profits of a business or the income of an individual. If it is a"
"case  of  dividends, 
interests,  or  discounts  appertaining 
to  a"
"business, 
they 
fall  within 
the  words 
“profits  of  any  business”  and"
"section (6) (1)(a) applies. If, however, it is a case of dividends, interest"
"or  discounts  accruing 
to  an 
individual  not, 
in 
the  course  of  a"
"business,  but  as  a  part  of  his  income  from  simple  investments,  then"
"section  6  (1)  (e) 
is 
the  relevant  section,  and  so 
far  as 
interest 
is"
"concerned, section 9 (3) modifies section 9 (1)” (Emphasis added)."
"[54]  The  above  passage  of  the  judgment  of  Soertsz  J.,  suggests  that  the"
"following  test  would  apply  to  identify  whether  the  profits  and  income  of  an"
"individual or business falls within section 3(1)(a) or 3(1) (e) as follows:"
"1. 
If  the  profits  or  income  received  from  dividends  or  interest  or  discounts"
"appertains  to  the  business,  it  will  fall  within  the  profits  of  any  business"
"under section 6(1)(a);"
"2. 
If  the  profits  or  income  received  from  dividends  or  interest  or  discounts"
"accruing to an individual was earned, not in the course of a business, but"
"as  a  part  of  his  income  from  simple  investments,  it  falls  within  section"
"3(1)(e)."
"[55] The test applied by Soertsz J., that section 6(1)(e) is limited to an income"
"of an “individual” and section 6(1)(a) is limited to the profits of any “business”"
"is not consistent with the scheme of the Inland Revenue Act, which does not"
"restrict the application of section 3(1)(e) to an individual. The CFI case related"
"to the receipts of interest and dividends, and the subject matter of the present"
"case,  related  to  commission  income.  However,  in  my  view  the  test  used  by"
"Howard CJ., and Keuneman, J. (with Wijewardene, J. agreed) equally applies"
"to  decide 
the  question  whether 
the  commission 
income  claimed  by 
the"
"Appellant  can  be  regarded  as  a  “profits  and  income”  from  trade  or  business"
"falling under section 3(1)(a) or any other source stipulated in section 3(1)(j) of"
"the  Act.  In  the  circumstance,  I  am  inclined  to  agree  with  the  test  applied  by"
"Howard CJ., and Keuneman, J. (with Wijewardene, J. agreed) in determining"
"whether  the  profits  and  income  received  by  the  Appellant  from  commission"
"falls under section 3(1)(a) or 3(1)(j) of the Inland Revenue Act."
"Business activities of the Appellant & the profits and income claimed by"
"the Appellant"
"[56] At the hearing, Mr. Rodrigo contended that the Appellant was engaged in"
"two separate transactions with Lanka Walltile Meepe Ltd. First, he stated that"
"the  Appellant  sold  tiles  manufactured  by  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd  to  third"
"parties  through  its  local  outlets, for which  a commission  of  5%  was  received"
"by the Appellant."
"Second,  he  stated 
that 
the  appellant  purchased 
tiles  from  Lanka  Walltile"
"Meepe Ltd for which no commission was involved."
