"Walltile  Meepe  Ltd,  for  which  the  commission  was  received  is  a  part  of  the"
"business income of the Appellant under section 3(1)(a) of the Inland  Revenue"
"Act."
"[12] He submitted that, as a separate transaction, the Appellant purchased tiles"
"from Lanka Walltile Meepe Ltd to fulfil part of its export orders and the income"
"received by the Appellant from such export sales constitutes a “qualified export"
"profits  and  income”  within  the  meaning  of  section  52  of  the  Inland  Revenue"
"Act.  His  contention  was  that  no  commission  was  paid  for  the  tiles  purchased"
"from  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd  for  the  purpose  of  export,  but  the  qualified"
"export  profits  and  income  earned  by  the  Appellant  fall  within  the  meaning  of"
"section 3(1)(a) of the Inland Revenue Act, instead of other income stipulated in"
"section 3(1) (j) of the Act."
"[13]  Mr.  Rodrigo  further  submitted  that  the  income  received  from  qualified"
"export profits and income, shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this"
"Act, be chargeable with income tax, at the rate specified in the Fifth Schedule"
"to  the  Inland  Revenue  Act,  and  therefore,  the  Appellant  is  entitled  to  the"
"concessionary  rate  of  tax  specified  in  section  52  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act."
"His  contention  was  that  the  term  “notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in"
"this Act” in section 52 overrides all other provisions of the Inland Revenue Act"
"in  the  ascertainment  of  qualified  export  profits  and  income  from  business  or"
"trade stipulated in section 3(a) and therefore, applicability of the fifth schedule"
"in  section  52,  shall  have  the  effect  notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary"
"contained elsewhere in the Inland Revenue Act."
"[14]  Mr.  Wimalasena  however,  disputed  this  contention  of  Mr.  Rodrigo  and"
"submitted that as per the Board Minute dated 24.10.2008, a sales commission"
"is paid to the Appellant on gross value of local sales, and local sales cover all"
"purchases  made  by  the  Appellant  from  its  subsidiary,  whether  for  sale  in  the"
"local  or  export  market,  and  therefore,  the  Appellant  received  the  commission"
"income  for  the  entire  purchase  of  tiles  from  its  subsidiary.  He  submitted  that"
"the Appellant has failed to disclose the sales commission received for the tiles"
"exported  by  the  Appellant  and  maintain  separate  accounts  as  required  by"
"section 106(11) of the Inland Revenue Act."
"[15]  He 
further 
submitted 
that 
the 
core  business  of 
the  Appellant 
is"
"manufacturing and marketing of ceramic wall tiles for local market and export,"
"and section 3 (1) (a) of the Inland Revenue Act relates only to “profits” earned"
"from  such  manufacturing  and  marketing  of  ceramic  wall  tiles  for  local  market"
"and  export,  which  also 
includes  qualified  exports.  He  argued 
that 
the"
"commission income received from purchasing tiles from Lanka Walltile Meepe"
"Ltd cannot be regarded as profits and income from  the main business activity"
"of 
the  Appellant  under  section  3(1)(a)  of 
the  Act,  and 
therefore, 
the"
"commission 
income  of 
the  Appellant  can  only  be  classified  as 
income"
