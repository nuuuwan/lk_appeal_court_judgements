"“A non-obstante clause is a legislative device which is usually employed to"
"give  overriding  effect  to  certain  provisions  over  some  contrary  provisions"
"that may be found either in the same enactment or some other enactment,"
"that is to say, to avoid the operation and effect of all contrary provisions. It"
"is equivalent to saying that in spite of the provisions or the Act mentioned"
"in  the  non-obstante  clause,  the  provisions  in  the  enactment  where  such"
"non-obstante clause is used will have its full operation or that the provision"
"indicated  in  the  non-obstante  clause  will  not  be  an  impediment  for  the"
"operation of the enactment”."
