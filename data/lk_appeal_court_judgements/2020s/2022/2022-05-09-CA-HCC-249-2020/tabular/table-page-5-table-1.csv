"that the deceased would have had the ability to speak after the incident. PW 5 had not been cross-"
"examined by the defence counsel. In the circumstances, no suggestions had been made at the trial"
"stage  that  the  deceased  could  not  speak.  Accordingly,  the  learned  trial  Judge  has  come  to  the"
"correct conclusion that the position that the deceased could speak is admitted by the defence."
"Medical evidence established that the deceased would have had a ""conscious state of mind"". The"
"medical evidence was to the effect that there was no injury to the brain of the deceased person."
"Therefore, the position that the deceased was conscious and rational at the time of making the"
"dying declaration is established."
"The learned counsel for the accused-appellant submitted that the prosecution could not establish"
"beyond reasonable doubt that the accused-appellant is ""Ukku Ranji""? Even if the evidence of PW 1"
"and PW 11 were to be believed, the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that"
"the accused-appellant was the person who committed the murder. The witness Gamini Peiris who"
"was at the place of the incident had not stated that the accused-appellant was seen at the place of"
"the incident. Counsel for the appellant argued that Gamini Peiris who had close contact with the"
"accused-appellant  had  not  stated  that  the  accused-appellant  was  known  as  ""Ukku  Ranji"".  The"
"prosecution had not clarified with him whether the accused-appellant is commonly known as ""Ukku"
"Ranji"" and whether there are other people in that area known as ""Ukku Ranji""."
"The wife of the deceased (PW 1) had stated that the accused-appellant was not known to her prior"
"to the incident, and she had not stated whether the deceased had referred to the accused-appellant"
"as ""Ukku Ranji"". Therefore, the learned counsel for the appellant states that there is no evidence to"
"prove that the accused-appellant was known to the deceased and the deceased had referred to the"
"accused-appellant as ""Ukku Ranji"""
"The only evidence which indicated that the accused-appellant was known as ""Ukku Ranji"" had been"
"stated by PW 11. When his evidence is taken into consideration, it is quite clear that he was unable"
"to  state  that  fact  with  100%  accuracy.  Owing  to  the  above  fact,  the  counsel  for  the  accused-"
"appellant further submitted that the evidence of PW 11 is vague, weak and moreover had not been"
"corroborated."
"Even if the evidence of PW 11 is considered in favour of the prosecution the learned counsel for the"
"accused-appellant argued that the following facts had not been proved."
