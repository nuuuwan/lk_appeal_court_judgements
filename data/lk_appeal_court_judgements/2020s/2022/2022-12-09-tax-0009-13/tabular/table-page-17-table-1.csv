"vs. Sarsfield (H. M. Inspector of Taxes) Reported (Ch.D) [1985] STC 31; (CA)",""
"[1986] STC 246 it is said,",""
"","“….A  back  duty  enquiry  was  instituted  in  1970  and,  on  16th  March"
"","1970, an Inspector of Taxes signed a certificate in volume 1 of his District"
"","Assessment  books  stating 
that  he  had  made  assessments  on 
the"
"","administrators for the years 1960-61 to 1966-67 inclusive. The notices of"
"","assessment  were  issued  on  16th  March  1970,  but  did  not  reach  the"
"","administrators until after 07th April 1970. It was common ground that the"
"","assessments would be out of time unless made before 06th April 1970 by"
"","reason  of  the  provisions  of  section  34  and  section  40(1)  of  the  Taxes"
"","Management Act of 1970. The administrators appealed."
"","The Special Commissioners held that (1) the assessments were “made” on"
"","16th March 1970, when a duly authorized Inspector signed the certificate"
"","in volume 1. They were therefore not out of time; (2) the increases to the"
"","assessments contended for by the  Inspector were supportable.  They did"
"","not  accept 
the  oral 
evidence  of 
the 
son,  M.  Honig,  one  of 
the"
"","administrators, that the increases in capital disclosed by the statements"
"","were attributable to rental income arising to the son, not the deceased."
"","The Chancery Division, dismissing the appeal, held that on the first point,"
"","it was clear on a proper construction of sections 29 and 114 of the Taxes"
"","Management  Act  of  1970,  that  the  making  of  the  assessment  was  not"
"","dependent  on 
the  service  of 
the  notice  of  assessment.  The  Special"
"","Commissioners were plainly right to hold that the assessments were made"
"","on 16th March 1970 and so within the time limit prescribed by sections 34"
"","and 40 (1) of that Act. On the second point, there was no possible ground"
"","on which the court could hold that the Special Commissioners conclusion"
"","was  perverse;  there  was  ample  evidence  before  them  on  which  to  make"
"","their findings of fact."
