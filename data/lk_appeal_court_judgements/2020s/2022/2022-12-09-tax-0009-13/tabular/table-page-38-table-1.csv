"H
owever, the question of law No. 04 is not correctly formulated, in the sense, it"
"should have referred not to “industrial  manufacturing”, but to “industrial tool"
"manufacturing”. Hence while the said question of law has to be answered in the"
"negative,  the  answer  must  accompany  with  an  explanation  that  the  term"
"“industrial and machine tool manufacturing” can be interpreted as “industrial"
"tool manufacturing” and “machine tool manufacturing”, in which the appellant’s"
"product comes within the former."
