"Later,  the  Senior  Assessor  Unit  12  has  issued  a  second  Notice  of  Assessment"
"bearing  No.  6069035  dated  13.02.2010.  The  appellant  submitted  that  it  was"
"issued ex facie after the time bar of 18 months."
"It may be noted, that, amendment Act No. 19 of 2009 which amended section"
"163(5)(a)  substituting 
“eighteen  months”  by 
“two  years” 
took  effect 
from"
"31.03.2009. One of the arguments of the respondent is that, since, 31.03.2009"
"was within the period relevant in this case, the amendment was applicable and"
"the time bar period is two years. The appellant argue, based on the preamble to"
"the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 that, the Act applies “year on year” and"
"hence  the  amendment  in  2009  has  no  application  for  the  year  of  assessment"
"2007/2008."
"The appellant has appealed against the second assessment bearing No. 6069035"
"by Petition of Appeal dated 15.03.2010."
"The  Deputy  Commissioner,  acting  under 
the  delegated  authority  of 
the"
"Commissioner General has decided on 01.02.2012 that “the proper and valid"
"assessment heard before me is 6069035 dated 13.02.2010 issued by Unit"
"12”."
"He has further decided that, the “assessment bearing number 9011616 is void"
"since no reasons were given for the issue of this assessment”."
"The  appellant  appealed 
from 
the  order  of 
the  Deputy  Commissioner  on"
"02.03.2012.  As  per  the  appellant,  “the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  does  not"
"identify  the  assessment  by  number  but  refers  to  the  date  of  issue  of  the"
"assessment  as  being  30.09.2009…”,  which  date 
is  the  date  of 
issue  of"
"assessment bearing No. 9011616 which was decided to be void by the Deputy"
"Commissioner. Hence the appellant argue that the Tax Appeals Commission has"
"considered an assessment, which was not before it."
"The appellant submits, that, under section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals Commission"
"Act,  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  is  limited  to  making  a"
