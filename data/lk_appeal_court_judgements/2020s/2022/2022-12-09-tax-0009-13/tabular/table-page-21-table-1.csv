"make  recoveries  pending  any  appeal  on  such  assessments.  The  overall"
"effect of this unhappy practice was to pressurise the tax payer to such an"
"extent that he was placed virtually at the mercy of the tax authorities. The"
"new law was a measure intended to do away with this practice. Under the"
"amendment when an Assessor does not accept a return, it must mean that"
"at the relevant point of time he has brought his mind to bear on the return"
"and  has  come  to  a  decision  rejecting  the  return.  Consequent  to  this"
"rejection,  the  reasons  must  be  communicated  to  the  Assessee.  The"
"provision for the giving of reasons and the written communication of the"
"reasons, contained in the  amendment, is to ensure that in fact the new"
"procedure would be followed. More particularly the communication of the"
"reasons at the relevant time is the indication of its compliance. The new"
"procedure  would  also  have  the  effect  of  fixing  the  Assessor  to  a"
"definite  position  and  not  give  him  latitude:  to  chop  and  change"
"thereafter. It was therefore essential that an Assessor who rejects a return"
"should  state  his  reasons  and  communicate  them.  His  reasons  must  be"
"communicated  at  or  about  the  time  he  sends  his  assessment  on  an"
"estimated income. Any later communication would defeat the remedial"
"action intended by the amendment‚Äù."
