"ground  of  appeal  has  not  been  prejudiced  the  Appellant’s  rights  in  this"
"case. Due to afore-said reasons this ground has no merit."
"In  the  second  ground  of  appeal  the  Appellant  contends  that  the  learned"
"High Court Judge has erroneously rejected the defence evidence."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  called  for  the  defence  after  evaluating"
"the  evidence  presented  by 
the  prosecution.  The  Appellant  had  given"
"evidence and had taken up the defence of accidental firing when according"
"to him, he grappled with the deceased’s husband and the gun went off. As"
"this is a general exception, the Appellant should have proved the same on a"
"standard  of  balance  of  probability  under  Section  105  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance.  Further  this  position  was  never  suggested  to  PW1,  who  is  an"
"eye witness in this case."
"The 
Appellant 
having 
put 
forth 
circumstances 
coming  within 
his"
"knowledge,  adducing  evidence  to  support  his  claim  is  his  duty  which  he"
"had  failed  to  do  so  in  this  case.  Hence,  rejection  of  the  defence  is  not"
"erroneous as the Learned High Court Judge has sufficiently considered the"
"evidence  presented  by  both  parties 
to  come 
to 
the  correct  decision."
"Therefore, this ground of appeal is also without merit."
"In the third ground of appeal the Appellant argues that the evidence led at"
"the 
trial  warrants 
the 
consideration  of 
the 
exception  of 
cumulative"
"provocation."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  argues  that  the  case  against  the"
"Appellant  should  have  been  considered  under 
the  plea  of  cumulative"
"provocation and the Appellant should have been awarded the benefit under"
"the said exception. She had emphasised the following items of evidence to"
"support her argument in this regard."
"As  the  Appellant’s  wife  was  estranged  from  him  and  was  living  with  her"
"daughter  in  her  parental  house,  all  his  efforts  to  reunite  with  his  family"
"was prevented by his father-in-law. At one occasion he was severally beaten"
