"5.","It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the learned"
"","High  Court  Judge  failed  to  consider  that  the  appellant  has  acted  whilst  he"
"","was deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation."
"6.","Exception 1 of section 294 of the Penal Code provides;"
"","“Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived"
"","of  the  power  of  self-control  by  grave  and  sudden  provocation,"
"","causes  the  death  of  the  person  who  gave  the  provocation,  or"
"","causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.”"
"","7.  The appellant has never taken the defence of grave and sudden provocation"
"","when  the  witnesses  for  the  prosecution  testified  in  court  at  the  trial.  This"
"","defence  was  never  put  to  the  witnesses  for  the  prosecution  even  in  cross"
"","examination.  It  seems 
that 
the  appellant  as  an  afterthought  has,  while"
"","admitting  the  offence  in  his  statement  from  the  dock  has  said  that  this"
"","happened due to sudden provocation."
"8.","In  terms  of  section  105  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  when  a  person  is"
"","accused of an offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances"
"","bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code is"
"","upon him. Also, in terms of  section 106 of  the Evidence Ordinance, when"
"","any  fact  is  especially  within  the  knowledge  of  any  person,  the  burden  of"
"","proving that fact is upon him."
"9.","I  bear  in  mind  that  even  if  the  accused  has  not  specifically  pleaded  the"
"","exception of grave and sudden provocation, it is incumbent upon the court"
"","to consider whether evidence suggests the same."
"","10. In the case of R.M. Karunaratne Vs. The Attorney General C.A. 181/2009,"
"","H.C. Puttalam 84/05 decided on 21.11.2011, held:"
"","“If  the  plea  of  grave  and  sudden  provocation  is  available  from"
"","the evidence of the prosecution itself, court has a duty to consider"
"","such a plea even if the accused did not raise it.”"
"1","1. In the instant case the  evidence adduced at the trial  does not  even suggest"
"","that  the  appellant  was  provoked.  There  is  no  evidence  to  show  that  the"
"","deceased ever provoked the appellant, nor that the deceased  was assaulted"
"","by the appellant by accident. There is no evidence other than the statement"
"","by  the  appellant  from  the  dock  that  the  appellant  was  provoked  by  any"
