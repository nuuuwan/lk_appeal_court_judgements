"the incident to her sister first, who in return had conveyed the same to her"
"mother."
"PW2, the mother of the victim had noticed the depressed mood of the victim,"
"but had only been made aware of the incident by her elder daughter. When"
"the  mother  had  questioned  the  victim,  she  had  told  her  mother  what  had"
"happened to her. Initially, PW2 had brought up the incident to the notice of"
"the  Appellant’s  wife  which  had  culminated  in  a  fight.  Thereafter,  a  police"
"complaint had been lodged by PW2 and the victim."
"PW4,  Dr.Sunil  Angampulige  had  examined  the  victim  and  submitted  the"
"Medico-Legal  Report.  In  his  report  although  no  injury  was  found  on  the"
"victim’s hymen the observations in the medical report had not excluded the"
"possibility  of  sexual  intercourse.  He  had  come  to  this  conclusion  as  the"
"examination  has  revealed  that  the  prosecutrix  had  an  extending  type  of"
"hymen and therefore, it was observed that a there was a possibility of sexual"
"intercourse having taken place even if there was no damage to or tear of the"
"hymen. The JMO had referred the prosecutrix to a psychiatric and according"
"to the report, the prosecutrix had a relatively lower level of intelligence."
"After the conclusion of the prosecution case, the Learned High Court Judge"
"had called for the defence. The Appellant had given evidence and had called"
"three witnesses in support of his case."
"Although the Appellant advanced four grounds of appeal, he did not proceed"
"to  canvass  the  first  ground  of  appeal  at  the  hearing.  Hence,  this  Appeal"
"commences with the consideration of the second ground of appeal."
"In the second ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Court failed"
"to consider evidence which negatives the occurrence of the offence."
"Since  the  victim  was  a  small  girl  when  she  encountered  this  unpleasant"
"ordeal,  she  had  not  revealed  the  incident  to  anybody  due  to  fear  of  the"
"Appellant. She had first divulged the incident to her elder sister after about"
"three  months  of  the  incident.  By  this  time  PW2  also  had  noted  her  new"
