"occupation in circumstances such as have transpired in the instant Application."
"Considering  all  the  above  stated  facts  and  circumstances,  I  hold  that  there  was  no"
"material for the LRC to form an opinion that the land described in the schedule to the"
"Quit Notice is a State land and that the Petitioner has encroached upon that land and he"
"is in unlawful possession/occupation of the same. Therefore, I hold that the attempt of"
"the LRC to recover possession of the subject matter of the instant action is inconsistent"
"with the scope of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act and it has no right to"
"issue the Quit Notice marked as P-8 in terms of that Act. Under the said circumstances,"
"it is manifestly clear that P-8 has been issued by the predecessor of the 2nd Respondent"
"without jurisdiction and it is ultra vires. Therefore, I decide to issue a writ of Certiorari"
"quashing the decision containing in the Quit Notice marked as P-8. The Respondents"
"should pay Rs. 75 000/- as costs to the Petitioner."
