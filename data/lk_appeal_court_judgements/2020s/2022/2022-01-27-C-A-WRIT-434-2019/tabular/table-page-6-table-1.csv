"T
he allegation of the LRC against the Petitioner is that he had encroached upon the land"
"of the LRC.  The Petitioner denies that  allegation and his  position is  that  there is  no"
"remaining  portion  of  Pattiya  Hena  which  belongs  to  the State  other  than  the  Pattiya"
"Hena for which the Statutory Determination P-3 was made in his mother’s favour in"
"1976  and  included  into  lot  232  in  the  Surveyor-General’s  plan  marked  as  P-4.  The"
"Petitioner  claim  that  his  mother  possessed  said  Pattiya  Hena  from  the  date  of  the"
"Statutory Determination in 1976 till the land was gifted to him in 1989 and after it was"
"gifted to him, he is possessing it up till the date of the Quit Notice on 04.06.2019 and"
"has relied on a long period of legal possession. Therefore, in addition to the paper title"
"to Pattiya Hena the Petitioner is claiming it on prescription. Under such circumstances,"
"it is clear that there is a serious question to be decided as to whether the land described"
"in  the  schedule  to  the  Quit  Notice  is  a  State  land.  In  the  case  of  Senanayake  vs."
"Damunupola (1982 2 SLR 621) the Supreme Court has held that;"
"‘A purposive examination and interpretation of this Law (State Land (Recovery"
"of Possession) Act) shows that it was enacted to get back possession of State land which"
"had been given to a person on a contractual footing and where there was an obligation"
"to vacate and give up possession or occupation on the happening of some event as a"
"necessary consequence. This procedure could not be availed of where it is not clear"
"that the land in respect of which the right or title of the State was doubtful or in dispute’"
"(at page 628). It was further held that;"
"‘The  scope  of  the  State  Land  (Recovery  of  Possession)  Act  was  to  provide  a"
"speedy or summary mode of getting back possession or occupation of ‘State land’ as"
"defined in the Act, where there was not subsisting at the relevant date, in the opinion of"
"the  Competent  Authority,  a  valid  permit  of  authority.  It  was  not  meant  to  obtain"
"possession of land which the State had lost possession of by encroachment or ouster"
"for  a  considerable  period  of  time  by  ejecting  a person  in  such  occupation’  (at  page"
"628)."
"In view of that decision of the Supreme Court it is clear that the procedure laid down in"
"the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act could not be used to evict a person from"
"a land which the right or title of the State to that land is doubtful or in dispute and it"
"was not meant to obtain possession of land which the State had lost possession of by"
