"statement while in police detention can be evidence against the maker and even"
"against anyone else, in terms of section16 of the PTA was nonexistent. I am of"
"the view that it was essential for the prosecution to eliminate the doubt whether"
"the statement was translated by a competent translator and recorded correctly,"
"which in my view the prosecution has failed to establish."
"Another matter that needed the consideration of the learned High Court Judge"
"was  whether  it  appears  that  there  had  been  a  threat,  inducement  or  promise"
"towards  the  appellant  in  making  the  alleged  confession.  The  position  of  the"
"appellant  was  that  he  never  made  a  confession,  but  was  asked  to  sign  some"
"documents under duress. However, the learned High Court Judge has rejected"
"that  contention  on  the  basis  that  the  evidence  led  by  the  prosecution  in  that"
"regard has established that there was no such duress but it was a voluntary act"
"of the appellant. He has also accepted the evidence of the JMO who examined"
"the appellant on 04-08-2011 and on 11-04-2011 deciding that there was no need"
"for the JMO to comment on any old scars or marks on the body of the appellant"
"in her report as she has looked only for recent injuries."
"It  is  not  unusual  in  a  case  of  this  nature  for  not  to  have  contradictions  and"
"omissions  in  the  evidence  of  the  prosecution  witnesses  as  they  are  official"
"witnesses. What is necessary in such a scenario is to look at the evidence as a"
"whole and come to a finding as to the trustworthiness of the evidence.  In this"
"regard, I find that the evidence of the JMO was highly unsatisfactory. The JMO"
"should have known very well the purpose of the appellant being produced before"
"her for a report, when produced under the custody of the officials of the detention"
"Centre. Under the circumstances, it was the duty of the JMO to conduct a proper"
"examination  of  the  appellant  and  report  not  only  the  recent  injuries,  but  any"
"possible  evidence  of  previous  injuries  as  well,  in  order  to  enable  the  Court  to"
"decide whether the appellant had to face any threat or intimidation for him to"
"make a confession to implicate himself in a crime."
