"summarized as follows:"
"1.  Ordinarily it is not safe to abuse a conviction for murder only upon the"
"dying declaration of the deceased when there is no corroboration of it"
"from 
any 
independent 
source.  Such 
corroboration  may  be  by"
"circumstantial evidence, or an oral statement made to a relative shortly"
"after the incident may corroborate a  subsequent duly recorded dying"
"declaration."
"2.  Though  ordinarily  corroboration  must  be 
looked 
for, 
there 
is  no"
"absolute rule of law or prudence that corroboration is always necessary"
"before a conviction which rests on a dying declaration can be sustained."
"Corroboration  is  necessary  when  the  declaration  is  an  incomplete"
