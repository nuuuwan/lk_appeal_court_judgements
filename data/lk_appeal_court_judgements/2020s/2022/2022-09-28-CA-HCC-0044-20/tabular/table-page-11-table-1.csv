"reliable  and  does  not  suffer  from  any  infirmity,  a  conviction  can  be"
"based on it even in the absence of corroboration. Each case must be"
"judged on its own facts. If it is proved that the dying declarations were"
"made  without  any  prompting  or  influence  by  anyone  and  there  is  no"
