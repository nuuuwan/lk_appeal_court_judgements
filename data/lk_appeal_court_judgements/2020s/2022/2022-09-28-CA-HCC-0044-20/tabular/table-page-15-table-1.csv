"I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the position taken"
"up by the appellant in his evidence with the view of considering that whether it"
"has created any doubt as to the prosecution evidence and come to a firm finding"
"in that regard, for which I have no reason to disagree."
"The  appellant  has  not  taken  any  defence  on  the  basis  that  the  incident  was"
"culpable homicide not amount to murder in terms of section 297 of the Penal"
"Code  at  the  trial.  It  is  trite  law  that  it  is  the  duty  of  a  trial  judge  to  consider"
"whether there is a possibility of culpable homicide not amounting to murder even"
"if an accused had not taken such a position before the trial judge, only if there"
"is evidence before the trial judge in that regard. I do not find any evidence before"
"the  trial  judge  to  come  to  such  a  conclusion,  hence,  no  basis  for  the  fourth"
"ground of appeal."
"I find that the appellant has been rightly convicted by the learned High Court"
"Judge based on the dying declarations made by the deceased and the attending"
"facts and circumstances."
"The  appeal  is  dismissed  as  it  is  devoid  of  any  merit.  The  conviction  and  the"
"sentence affirmed."
