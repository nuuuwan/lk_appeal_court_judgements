"evidence is not disputed and is accepted by the opponent subject of course"
"to the qualification that the witness is a reliable witness.‚Äù"
"If he called the brother of the deceased and informed that such a thing happened,"
"that  position  should  have  been  put  to  PW-01  and  PW-02  when  they  gave"
"evidence,  which  has  not  been  done.  The  evidence  of  the  elder  brother  of  the"
"deceased was that it was his deceased brother who gave a call around midnight"
"from a house of a friend called Suresh. If it was he who wanted to give medical"
"aid to the deceased as soon as possible, confronting the brother of the accused"
"when he gave evidence should have been the first step towards adding value to"
"the  story  of  the  appellant  in  his  evidence  towards  creating  a  doubt  as  to  the"
"evidence of the prosecution witnesses. It is clear that the story  of an accident"
"due  to  the  actions  of  the  deceased  himself  was  an  afterthought,  but  without"
"merit."
"If it was an accident as claimed by the appellant, there was no reason for him to"
"be out of the vicinity when the brothers of the deceased arrived at the place where"
"the deceased was found, as it was his duty to offer help to his friend who was"
"consuming liquor with him and got himself burned  due to his own actions as"
"claimed."
"The argument advanced that the deceased had burn injuries to his lower part of"
"the body, and that was in line with the position of the appellant that when the"
"deceased  attempted  to  light  a  cigarette  while  seated,  the  petrol  fumes  on  the"
"ground caused the fire."
"When considering the uncontradicted evidence of the JMO, it is clear that the"
"deceased had burn injuries on the head and the face, in addition to injuries to"
"the thighs and the legs. If it was the poured petrol which was on the rock that"
"triggered the fire, there is no possibility of the deceased having burn injuries to"
"his head and the face."
