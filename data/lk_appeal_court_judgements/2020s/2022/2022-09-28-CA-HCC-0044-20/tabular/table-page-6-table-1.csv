"a dying deposition should be treated with utmost care in the evaluation was his"
"position."
"It was the view of the learned President’s Counsel that, given the fact that there"
"was no motive for the appellant to commit the murder of the deceased and given"
"the  other  facts  and  the  circumstances,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  should"
"have  considered  the  possibility  of  an  accident.  It  was  also  his  view  that  the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to  consider  the  matters  in  favour  of  the"
"appellant  in  this  regard.  Commenting  on  the  evidence  of  the  Judicial  Medical"
"Officer,  it  was  the  position  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  that  since  the"
"deceased  has  died,  as  a  result  of  Septicemia,  it  was  the  duty  of  the  JMO  to"
"explain the reasons for his conclusions, which the JMO has failed to do in his"
"evidence. It was also the position of the learned President’s Counsel, if evaluated"
"properly, the evidence placed before the Court leads only towards the conclusion"
"that this was an accident or at least an offence in terms of section 298 of the"
"Penal Code, and not a case of murder as concluded by the learned High Court"
"Judge in his judgement."
"Replying  the  learned  President’s  Counsel,  it  was  the  position  of  the  learned"
"Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) that it is settled law, that the motive is"
"not a matter that needs to be established for a crime of this nature to be proved,"
"although it would be a plus factor if it can be so established. It was his view that"
"there was no evidence placed before the learned High Court Judge to consider"
"the incident as a result of an accident or a matter that could be considered in"
"terms  of  section  298  of  the  Penal  Code.  It  was  his  position  that  the  dying"
"depositions  made  by 
the  deceased  on  several  occasions  are  cogent  and"
"trustworthy that the Court can rely solely on the dying depositions to find the"
"appellant  guilty.  He  also  points  to  the 
fact  that  the  appellant  has  never"
"confronted the relevant witnesses when they gave evidence before the High Court"
"as to the stand taken by him in his evidence when called for a defence."
