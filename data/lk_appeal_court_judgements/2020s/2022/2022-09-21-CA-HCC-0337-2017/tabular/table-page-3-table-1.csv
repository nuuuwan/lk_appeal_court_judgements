land."
"Subsequently,  both  of  them  had  grown  capsicum  separately.    PW2  was  also"

"the deceased and the appellant.  According to PW2,  on the day of the incident,"
"around    6.00  in  the  morning,  he  had  gone  to  the  land.    PW2  had  seen  the"
"appellant  was  on  the  land  removing  weeds.    The  appellant  told  PW2  that"
