roblems  with  the  deceased.    The  evidence  revealed  that  there  was  a  dispute"
"between  the  deceased  and  the  appellant  regarding  a  money  transaction.    The"
"police had recovered a කැති (scythe or sickle) consequent to a statement of the"
"appellant.  The injuries on the dead body of the deceased were compatible with"
"that caused by the scythe (කැති.)"
"Those  were  the  circumstantial  evidences  which  led  to  the  conviction  of  the"
"appellant.    The  evidence  also  reveals  that  the  deceased  person  drinks  alcohol"
"frequently and was short-tempered, and was inclined to fight with others."
"The main item of circumstantial evidence is what the appellant had told about"
"the  deceased  to  PW2.  That  is;  “හදිසසියේ අදත් රණ්ඩු වුයනාත් මම යේ මනුෂ්‍යයාව"
"ඉතුරු කරන්යන නැහැ.”"
"This portion of the evidence was considered against the appellant.  When this"
"statement was taken as evidence, it should also have been taken into account"
"what  is  favourable  to  the  appellant.    As  per  the  evidence,  the  appellant  had"
"said, “if he comes to quarrel with me today as well, I will finish him.” So, this"
"should  be  taken  as,  if  the  deceased  had  not  come  to  fight  with  the  appellant,"
"there  would  not  have  been  any  incident.    There  were  no  eyewitnesses  to  the"
"incident.    As  per  the  evidence,  it  was  probable  that  there  was  a  sudden  fight"
"between the deceased and the appellant."
"In  those  circumstances,  convicting  the  appellant  for  the  offence  of  murder  is"
"not  safe.  We,  therefore,  set  aside  the  conviction  and  the  sentence  imposed  on"
"the appellant by the learned High Court Judge.  We convict the appellant of the"
"offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis that there"
"was a sudden fight between them."
