"This Court was not presented with any evidence to demonstrate how this information came to the"
"possession of the said Assistant Government Agent, especially following the fact that there is no"
"last will executed and the said Harry Manawadu had died intestate. However subsequent to this"
"letter, the license had been issued bearing only the name of the Petitioner (P7(a)). It is pertinent"
"to observe that this license bears the date 88 December 30, valid for the year 1989. Thus, in our"
"view, the Petitioner has established that he had been in possession of a valid license in his name"
"from the year 1987 and it was the Petitioner’s contention that he had operated the said business"
"from 1989 to 1995 as a single license holder. In 1995, he closed his business as his license had"
"not   been   extended.   Subsequent   to   filing   a   writ   application,   the   Petitioner   had   once   again"
"commenced his business activities  from 2004 till 2012. Even though the application for this"
"license was not tendered to the Court, it was submitted that the said license was issued to the"
"Petitioner as the sole license holder."
"It is  the contention  of the Petitioner  that  in 2012, the Excise  Department  had conducted  an"
"inquiry pertaining to his ownership of the liquor business to which the Petitioner had not been"
"able to attend. Thereafter the 1st  Respondent had sought further clarifications by letter dated"
"29.08.13   (P22)   to   which   the   Petitioner   had   replied   by   his   letter   dated   04.09.13   (P23).   The"
"Petitioner   had   subsequently   received   a   letter   requesting   him   to   be   present   at   the   Excise"
"Department office on 01.10.13(P24). As per the contents of the said letter, it is clear that the"
"purpose of requesting the Petitioner to be present was to obtain a statement pertaining to the"
"accuracy of the documents submitted, and further he had been asked to furnish the documents"
