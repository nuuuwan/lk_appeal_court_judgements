"As observed earlier in this Judgment, this Court is mindful that the license is valid only for a"
"period of one year, provided the Petitioner has satisfied the requirements stipulated under the"
"Excise Ordinance and the Regulations are fulfilled and there are no objections or any bar for the"
"Petitioner   to   obtain   the   said   license   under   the   provisions   of   the   Excise   Ordinance   and   the"

"they were willing to consider any fresh applications if any, tendered by the Petitioner as well as"
"the 8th Respondent pertaining to the issuance of new license according to the law."

"mandamus as prayed for by the Petitioner. However, the Petitioner as well as the 8th Respondent"
"are free to make an application to obtain a license if they so desire according to law."
"Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, we issue a writ of certiorari in terms of prayer (c, d) of"
"the petition."

"the above, the Petitioner’s application is partly allowed. The parties to bear their own cost."
