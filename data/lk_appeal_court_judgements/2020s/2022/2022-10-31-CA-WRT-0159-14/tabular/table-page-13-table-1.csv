"of   the   Excise   Department   but   by   giving   consideration   to   the   findings   of   the   Presidential"
"Investigation Unit. Hence both the Petitioner’s grounds for the urging of a writ of certiorari has"
"to succeed as the 1st Respondent in this instance had relied on the findings of the 7th Respondent"
"to come to the conclusion which resulted in P33 which is tantamount to an abdication of power"
"vested with the 1st Respondent."
"However, this Court wishes to state that in view of the assertions made by the Respondents, this"
"Court has not gone into the merits of the said accusation. Thus, even though this Court holds that"
"invalidating   of   the   Petitioner’s   license   cannot   be   sustained   due   to   the   incorrect   procedure"
"adopted, it does not preclude the 1st  Respondent if they so desire to hold a fresh inquiry to"
"ascertain the truth of the matter according to law and to take appropriate decisions and steps"
"according to law."
"The next application of the Petitioner was to seek a writ of certiorari to quash document P29. As"
"per our brief, the document P29 is a letter where the Assistant Excise Commissioner has written"
"to the Divisional Secretary of Gonapinuwala whereby he has recommended extending the excise"
"license issued to the Petitioner, that is from 01.01.2014 to 31.03.2014. In any event, document"
"P29 only contains a recommendation and as it is not a final decision, nevertheless all parties"
"were not at variance that the said relief is now futile."
"The Petitioner has also sought a writ of certiorari to quash licenses, if any, issued to the 8 th"
"Respondent. However, there was no material submitted to this Court pertaining to the issuance of"
"a new license to the 8th Respondent.  Also, none of the Counsels addressed this Court pertaining"
"to the issuance of a license to the 8th Respondent.  Therefore, this Court is not inclined to grant"
"this relief based on a vague prayer that is uncertain, and in the absence of any decision to grant"
"the license to the 8th Respondent, the said relief has to fail."
