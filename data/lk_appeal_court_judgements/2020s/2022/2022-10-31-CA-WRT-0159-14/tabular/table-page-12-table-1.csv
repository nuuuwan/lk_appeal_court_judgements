"Even though the said letter states that in addition to the findings of the Presidential Inquiry Unit,",""
"the Excise Department too had conducted an inquiry, the Petitioner vehemently denied that there",""
"was an independent inquiry held before his license was suspended by the 1st Respondent.",""
"As per the submissions of the Petitioner, his main ground urging for a writ of certiorari is based",""
"on the premise that his license has been invalidated by the 1st  Respondent without holding a",""
"proper inquiry.  It appears that the whole crux of this case pertaining to the issuance of a writ of",""

"Respondents gives us the answer. The said paragraph states as follows;",""
"“Answering   paragraphs   9,10,11   and   12   the   Respondents   admit   only   that   Harry   Manawadu",""

"As per the plain reading of this objection, it is clear the Respondents have taken the decision to",""
"invalidate the license only after considering the findings of the Presidential Investigation Unit",""

"Court by the Respondents, pertaining to the said inquiry independent of the findings of the 7 th",""

"This   was   substantiated   by   the   learned   Counsel   appearing   for   1st","to   7th  Respondents,   who"
"conceded that there was no independent inquiry held by the 1st Respondent under the provisions",""
