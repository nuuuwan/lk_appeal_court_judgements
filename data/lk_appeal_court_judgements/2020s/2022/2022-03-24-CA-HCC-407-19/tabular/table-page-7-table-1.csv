"I
n  the  instant  action,  the  victim’s  evidence  has  been  corroborated  by"
"the evidence of PW 9 as well as by the medical evidence. However, even"

"as it is apparent that he speaks the truth. The doctor who gave evidence"

"So,  there  is  sufficient  evidence  to  prove  that  the  victim  was  sexually"
"abused. When the entirety of the evidence is considered together, it is"
"established that the offence of grave sexual abuse has been committed"
