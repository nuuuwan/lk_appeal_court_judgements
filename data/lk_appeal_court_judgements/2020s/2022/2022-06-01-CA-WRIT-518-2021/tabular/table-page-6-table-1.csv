"Petitioners submitted a bid in respect of the said Castle Street Women’s Hospital under"
"the  Procurement  No.  MH/PB/CL/19/2021.  The  13th  Respondent,  M/S  Rakna"
"Arakshaka  Lanka  Limited  and  M/S  Floor  Care  also  submitted  bids  in  addition  to  the"
"Petitioners’  bid.  The  bid  submitted  by  the  Petitioners,  at  the  opening  of  bids,  has  been"
"placed as the 3rd lowest among the bidders. The bid submitted by M/S Rakna Arakshaka"
"Lanka  Limited  which  was  the  lowest,  has  been  rejected  at  the  Appeal  stage  for  non-"
"compliance of tender conditions. Consequently, the 13th Respondent who submitted the"
"2nd lowest bid was awarded the subject tender."
"The Petitioners challenging the award of the tender to the said 13th Respondent, seek inter"
"alia, from this Court a writ of Prohibition restraining 1st to 12th Respondents from issuing"
"the Letter of Award and also entering into a contract in respect of the subject tender for"
"year  2021/2022  with  the  13th  Respondent.  The  Petitioners  are  seeking  for  a  writ  of"
"Certiorari  to  quash  even  the  decisions  of  the  Procurement  Committee  (‘PC’)  and  the"
"Technical Evaluation Committee (‘TEC’)."
"Worth Certificate"
"One of the main contentions of the Petitioners is that the 13th Respondent has not duly"
"submitted the Worth Certificate which is a requirement in terms of Clause 1.VIII of the"
"Tender Conditions and the Petitioners argue that it is a threshold eligibility requirement"
"and non-compliance of the said condition would amount to a major deviation in terms of"
"clauses 7.8.4 and 7.8.6 of the Government Procurement Guidelines of 2006 (‘Procurement"
"Guidelines’). The Petitioners complain is that the Worth Certificate of the 13th Respondent"
"should be under the name of the 13th Respondent company whereas the said Certificate"
"submitted by the 13th Respondent, marked ‘R13’, has been issued under the name of one"
"Ms. Ramyani Fonseka."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioners  referring  to  the  purpose  of  incorporating  a"
"company and also to the fundamental attribute of an incorporated company submits that"
"the Worth Certificate provided by the 13th Respondent should transpire the worth of the"
"13th  Respondent  Company  and  not  the  worth  in  relation  to  Ms.  Fonseka.  The  learned"
"Counsel  for  the  13th  Respondent  referring  to  the  annual  return  of  the  13th  Respondent"
"Company marked ‘13R8’ submits that 13th Respondent is a company run by husband and"
"wife who are both Shareholders and Directors and the relevant Worth Certificate is in the"
"name of the wife (Ms. Ramyani Fonseka) who is also a Director and a Shareholder."
