"H
is position is that he had made several telephone calls to his wife while under"
"arrest.  The defence produced the call records of the appellant’s mobile phone,"
"taken  on  the  1stof  October  2016.    However,  the  position  of  the  prosecution  is"
"that the appellant was arrested at the Maligawatte cemetery at 10.40 a.m.  PW"
"1  handed  over  the  appellant’s  phone  to  the  reserve  police  of  the  Maligawatte"
"police  station  at  12.10  p.m..    From10.40  a.m.,  to  12.10  p.m.,  there  were  no"
"calls generated from the mobile phone of the appellant. It is difficult to believe"
"that  the  police  allowed  the  appellant  to  take  calls  from  his  phone  six  times,"
"while  he  was  under  arrest.  Furthermore,  all  the  calls  were  generated  in  the"
"area of Maligawatte.  The learned High Court Judge has observed that no calls"
"were  generated  from  the  Wattala  area.    Having  carefully  considered  the  call"
"records  and  the  evidence,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  come  to  the"
"conclusion that the defence evidence did not create a reasonable doubt in the"
"prosecution  case.  I  see  no  reason  to  disagree  with  the  findings  of  the  learned"
"Trial Judge."
"The  next  point  raised  for  the  appellant  is  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge"
"has misdirected himself in the evaluation of the prosecution case."
"It is argued that the evidence of PW 1 and PW 2, with regard to what they had"
"done from 8.05 a.m. to 10.00 a.m. varied  from each other.  This  position was"
"clearly dealt with by the learned High Court Judge in para 29 of the judgment."
"and observed that there  were no  contradictions. Therefore, this argument has"
"no substance, and I reject the same."
"The last point raised by the appellant is that the learned High Court Judge has"
"come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  appellant  was  guilty  before  considering  the"
"defence evidence.  This argument cannot be accepted."
"Before  a  judgment  is  written,  a  judge  thoroughly  reads  the  whole  case  record"
"and then comes to a conclusion regarding all issues."
