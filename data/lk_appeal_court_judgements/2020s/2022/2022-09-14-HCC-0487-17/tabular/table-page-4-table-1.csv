"I
n the case of Rajapakse vs The State [2001] 2 SRI LR 161, the Court of Appeal"
"held that the period of time within which an appeal should  be preferred must"
"be calculated from the date on which the reasons are given."
"In the instant case, the judgement was pronounced and the reasons were given"
"on the 29th of April  2015.  The appeal  was filed on  the  8th  of November  2017,"
"which  was  more  than  two  and  a  half  years  after  the  pronouncement  of  the"
"judgment.    Therefore,  the  submission  made  by  the  Learned  Deputy  Solicitor"
"General to the effect that the appeal is out of time should succeed."
"In the case of Padmasiri v Attorney General 2012(1) SLR 24, it was held, “….if"
"we  allow  this  application  it  would  amount  to  condescending  or,  the  court"

"Rajapakshe vs State [2001] 2 Sri LR 161, Wijeratne vs Attorney General [2010]"
"2 SRI LR408)."
"The first ground of appeal is that PW1 had stated at the proceedings (on page"
"108) the name of the accused as Ishan Lakmal Siriwardene.  It was submitted"
"in  the  written  submissions  of  the  appellant  that  the  above-stated  name  is"
"totally  different 
from  the  appellant’s  name  and  therefore,  there  can  be  a"
"confusion

proceedings  were"
"subsequently  corrected  by  the  appellant  without  any  objections.      Therefore,"
"this ground of appeal has no merit."
