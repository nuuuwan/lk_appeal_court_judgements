"relating to the imposition payment and recovery of income tax should not"
"apply to the profits and income of the Enterprise’ and claimed that the TAC"
"has determined that the Appellant's entire income should be exempted from"
"income tax. However, it is important to note that the aforementioned phrase"
"is subject to the following qualification in the same paragraph: ‘granted a"
"tax  exemption  …….  in  relation  to  the  business  of  the  enterprise  namely"
"manufacturing and marketing of rolled steel products’"
"Therefore, as suggested in the third question of law, it is incorrect to state"
"that the TAC has acknowledged that the entire income of the enterprise is"
"exempted from income tax."
"Conclusion"
"Thus, having considered all arguments presented to this Court, I hold that"
"the TAC has not erred arriving at its determination."
"Accordingly, I answer all four questions of law in the negative in favour of"
"the Respondent."
