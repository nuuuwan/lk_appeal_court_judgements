"It was also submitted by the Appellant that although the term profits and",""
"income is not defined in the BOI agreement, the term profits and income",""
"is defined in Section 217 of the IR Act to mean ‘the net profits or income",""
"from  any  source","for  any  period  calculated 
in  accordance  with 
the"
"provisions of this act.’ Accordingly, it was argued that the relevant clause",""
"grants the relief to the income of the Appellant from all sources and the",""
"entirety of the IR Act has no application to the profits and income of the",""

"However, it is important to observe that clause 10 (i) is followed by the",""

"‘In  accordance  with  and  subject  to  the  powers  conferred  on  the  Board",""
"under Section 17 of the said law No. 04 of 1978 and regulations that may",""
"be  applicable  there  to  the  following  benefit  and/or  exemptions  and/or",""
"privileges are hereby granted to the enterprise in connection with and/or",""
"in relation to the business’ (Emphasis added)",""
"Clause 10 (i) cannot be read in isolation from the opening paragraph of",""
"clause 10. Therefore, it is clear that clause 10 (i) is restricted by the opening",""
"paragraph  in  clause  10  and  any  exemption  granted  to  the  Appellant",""
"pursuant to clause 10 should be in connection with and/or in relation to the",""

"However, the Appellant’s argument was that clause 10 (i) should not be",""

"of it.",""
"I am not inclined to accept the submission of the Appellant as it is contrary",""
"to the accepted rules of interpretation. In addition, the agreement with the",""
"BOI  is  entered  into  under  the  aforementioned  regulations  made  under",""
"Section  17  (1)  of","the  BOI  Act.  Accordingly,  any  agreement  cannot"
"supersede the rules set out in the Gazette Notification.",""
"The Regulation No. 6 of the Gazette Notification reads thus;",""
