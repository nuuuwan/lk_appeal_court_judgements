"‘The view I have reached is that the categories enumerated in Section 6"
"(1) are mutually exclusive, and that the question whether 6 (1) (a) or 6 (1)"
"(e) applies in a particular case, depends on whether we are dealing with"
"the profits of a business or the income of an individual. If it is a case of"
"dividends,  interests,  or  discounts  appertaining  to  a  business,  they  fall"
"within the words “profits of any business” and section (6) (1) (a) applies."
"If, however, it is a case of dividends, interest or discounts accruing to an"
"individual not, in the course of a business, but as a part of his income"
"from simple investments, then section 6 (1) (e) is the relevant section, and"
"so  far  as  interest  is  concerned,  section  9  (3)  modifies  section  9  (1).’"
"(Emphasis added)"
"Relying on the aforementioned view expressed by Soertsz J., the Appellant"
"submitted that if the interest appertains to a business, the interest falls under"
"Section 6 (1) (a) and if the interest accruing to an individual, then Section"
"6 (1) (e) applies.  Accordingly, the Appellant argued that the Appellant not"
"being an individual, the income of the Appellant should anyway fall under"
"Section 6 (1) (a) of the IR Act."
"However, it is important to observe that in Section 217 of the IR Act, the"
"interpretation Section, the word person is defined to include a company as"
"well. Moreover, I am of the view that the language in Section 3 of the IR"
"Act  does  not  suggest  an  interpretation  as  to  if  interest  accrues  to  an"
"individual, not in the course of a business, it is not profit of a business but,"
"is part of his income and if the interest appertains to a company, it is profits"
"of the business. The reason being, Section 3 (a) of the IR Act is not limited"
"to the profits from any trade or business but includes the profits from any"
"profession  or  vocation  as  well.  A  profession  or  vocation  is  obviously"
"related to an individual. Therefore, it is obvious that application of Section"
"3 (a) of the IR Act cannot be limited to a business. Similarly, the dividends"
"interest or discounts are not limited to an individual but could be in relation"
"to a company as well. Accordingly, Section 3 (e) also could not be limited"
"to an individual and should apply to a company as well. Hence, in my view"
"the above submission of the Appellant is devoid of merit."
"As a result, although the Appellant suggested that the TAC erred in failing"
"to apply the test suggested by Soertsz J., with whom de Kretser J., agreed,"
"in my view, the TAC has not."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  also  submitted  that  the  TAC"
"incorrectly comprehended the CFI judgement by the following statement"
