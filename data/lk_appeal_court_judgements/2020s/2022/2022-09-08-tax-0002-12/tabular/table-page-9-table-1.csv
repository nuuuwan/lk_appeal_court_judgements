"his determination that the Appellant  did  not adduce  any evidence  to the"
"effect that investment is part of their principal activity, manufacturers and"
"dealers of all types of steel rolled products. Yet, the Appellant has failed to"
"submit 
those  material  evidence  at 
least 
to 
the  TAC.  The  Appellant"
"submitted that the proper cause of action for this Court is to remit the case"
"back  to  the  TAC  to  ascertain  evidence  as  to  whether  the  funds  in  the"
"accounts  were 
indeed  excess  funds 
that  were  deposited 
to 
the  bank"
"accounts, as stated by the TAC."
"In  light  of  the  above,  the  Appellant's  submissions,  I  would  first  like  to"
"examine  whether 
the  onus 
is  on 
the  Appellant 
to  establish 
that 
the"
"Appellant is exempt from income tax or that the Respondent must establish"
"that the Appellant is liable to tax. In the case of Union of India v. (M/s)."
"Wood  Papers  Limited6 
it  was  observed 
that;  ‘Literally  exemption 
is"
"freedom from liability, tax or duty. Fiscally it may assume varying shapes,"
"especially in a growing economy. For instance, tax holiday to new units,"
"concessional  rate  of  tax  to  goods  or  persons  for  limited  period  or  with"
"specific  objective  etc.  That 
is  why 
its  construction,  unlike  charging"
"provision, is like an exception and on normal principle of construction or"
"interpretation  of  statutes, 
it 
is  construed  strictly  either  because  of"
"legislative intention or on economic justification of inequitable burden or"
"progressive  approach  of 
fiscal  provisions 
intended 
to  augment  State"
"revenue’."
"It was also observed ‘When the question is whether a subject falls in the"
"notification  or  in  the  exemption  clause  then  it  being  in  the  nature  of"
"exception is to construed strictly and against the subject; but once about"
"ambiguity or doubt about applicability is lifted and the subject falls in the"
"notification, then full play should be given to it and it calls for a wider and"
"liberal construction’."
"In the case of Madras Provincial Co-operative Bank Ltd. v. Commissioner"
"of  Income 
tax,  Madras,7 
the  question  was  one  of  construction  of  a"
"notification  granting  a  tax  exemption  to  a  Co-operative  society  for  the"
"profits  made  in  its  turnover.  The  Court  observed  that  ‘If  an  assessee  is"
"under a section of taxing statute assessable to tax, it is for that person to"
"show that he has been exempted’."
