"the construction of the 5th Respondent had been specifically discussed and recommendations to"
"rectify and stop any further construction had been made. It is pertinent to note that the officers of"
"the 4th Respondent had attended the said meeting. At the said meeting, a decision had been taken"
"for   the   4th  Respondent   to   submit   all   building   plans   to   the   planning   committee   of   the   4th"
"Respondent, to enable them to reconsider the building plans that had already been approved,"
"within the protected area and if in violation of the regulations pertaining to the protected area, to"
"cancel such approvals in violation. (1R4)."
"Subsequently, on 26.07.2016, the Environmental Management and Assessing Committee of the"
"1st  Respondent had written to the 4th  Respondent and informed that despite the 4th  Respondent"
"being   informed   of   the   protected   zone   on   19.4.2007,   the   4th  Respondent   had   approved   the"
"development   plan   of   the   5th  Respondent   to   construct   a   house   within   the   protected   zone   on"
"17.06.2017."
"The officers of the 4th  Respondent further extended the development permit issued to the 5th"
"Respondent   subsequent   to   being   present   at   the   special   meeting   held   on   24.06.2016.   Thus,"
"disregarding and violating the decisions taken at the said meeting."
"As per the material submitted to this Court, we observe with dismay that the 4 th  Respondent"
"being aware of the establishment of the ‘Environmental Protection Zone’ had not only approved"
"the   development   plan   but   after   attending   the   stakeholders’   meeting,   had   extended   the"
"development permit by one year. This Court also observes that this extension was given after the"
"4th  Respondent   had   sought   to   cancel   the   development   permit   and   had   informed   the   5 th"
"Respondent to stop the construction. The 4th Respondent has failed to explain this action."
