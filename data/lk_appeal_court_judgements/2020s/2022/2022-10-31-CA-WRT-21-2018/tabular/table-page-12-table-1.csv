"The complaint unit of the 1st  Respondent had thereafter informed the Director of the Natural"
"Resources Management Unit, of the 1st  Respondent to take necessary action pertaining to the"
"complaint by the 1st Petitioner by its letter dated 12.08.16 (A12). It is also pertinent to note that"
"the building permit the 5th Respondent had obtained from the 4th Respondent dated 17.06.2016"
"(5R4) had been recalled by the 4th Respondent by letter dated 26.09.16 (A14). Accordingly, it is"
"observed that the 5th  Respondent had been informed to surrender the building approval permit"
"issued by the 4th Respondent to cancel the same within three months of it being issued, on the"
"basis that the land the permit had been issued for development, falls within the protected zone."
"Further, by the said letter of cancellation, the 4th  Respondent had informed the 5th  Respondent"
"that,   as   the   construction   work   is   in   its   preliminary   stages,   all   construction   work   should   be"
"stopped and has requested the 5th Respondent to hand over the original development permit back"
"to the 4th Respondent. There is no material to demonstrate that this order has been complied with"
"by the 5th Respondent. In the said circumstances, it is the contention of the Petitioners that the 1st"

"According to 1R2, it is clear that the officers of the 1st  Respondent had visited the site of the"
"alleged construction as far back as the 10th of June and being satisfied that the construction work"
"is being carried out within the protected zone, had instructed the 5th  Respondent to stop the"
"unauthorized construction. This establishes that the 5th Respondent had failed to obtain the prior"
"approval of the approving authority for the development work within the protected area. The"
"Court also observes that as per 1R2, when the officers of the 1st Respondent visited the site, the"
"construction had been at its initial stages as visible in the photographs. The construction of the"
"house was still at the stage of cutting and laying the foundation and ground clearance. The field"
"inspection report clearly indicates that the field officer had telephoned the 5th  Respondent and"
"had informed him to stop the construction of the house as it does not fall under the permitted use"
"within   the   environmental   protected   area.   The   5th  Respondent   has   failed   to   contradict   this"
"evidence."
"The 1st Respondent has also held a meeting with the stakeholders to resolve the issues pertaining"
