"The petitioner too had given evidence on behalf of the absolute owner and has"
"stated that he is not claiming the vehicle."
"After the conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Magistrate of Dambulla by his"
"order dated 05-10-2016 has determined that the absolute owner has  failed to"
"show sufficient reasons to satisfy the Court that the mentioned vehicle should"
"not be confiscated. Therefore, the learned Magistrate has decided to confiscate"
"the vehicle to the State."
"It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  claimant  before  the  learned  Magistrate,  namely  the"
"absolute owner of the vehicle has not filed any application if the claimant was"
"aggrieved by the decision of the learned Magistrate."
"However, it was the petitioner who informed the  learned Magistrate  that he is"
"not claiming the vehicle, who has filed the revision application in the High Court"
"of  Kandy  Case  No-  Revision  113/16,  on  the  basis  of  being  aggrieved  by  the"
"decision of the learned Magistrate."
"The learned High Court Judge of Kandy after having considered the submissions"
"made on behalf of the petitioner as well as the submissions by the State, has"
"dismissed the application of the petitioner by her judgement dated 07-06-2017."
"It had been determined that the petitioner is not entitled to seek the discretionary"
"remedy  of  revision  as  he  has  informed  the  learned  Magistrate  that  he  is  not"
"claiming the vehicle and therefore, he is estopped from claiming that he is an"
"aggrieved party. It had been also decided by the High Court Judge that the failure"
"of the petitioner to name the absolute owner who claimed the vehicle before the"
"Magistrate Court as a necessary party to the revisionary application before the"
"High Court was also a fatal defect."
"At  the  hearing  of  this  appeal,  it  was  the  contention  of  the  learned  Presidentâ€™s"
"Counsel on behalf of the petitioner that there was no provision to charge a person"
"in terms of Section 52 (1) of the Ordinance for transporting a dangerous drug. It"
"was also his view that the petitioner has been charged for committing the same"
"offence twice, which was not in accordance with the relevant principles of law."
