"Hence, it was his position that holding an inquiry and confiscating the vehicle"
"owned  by  the  petitioner  was  wrong,  and  therefore,  his  application  should  be"
"allowed."
"It was the position  of the learned  Deputy Solicitor General  (DSG) on behalf of"
"the  Attorney  General  that  any  offence  committed  in  terms  of  the  Ordinance"
"attracts the forfeiture provision in terms of Section 79 of the Ordinance. It was"
"her contention that the learned Magistrate has held a due inquiry and there was"
"nothing illegal in the procedure followed by the learned Magistrate. She pointed"
"out that the petitioner who has specifically informed that he is not exercising his"
"right to claim the mentioned vehicle before the learned Magistrate, cannot now"
"come before this Court or go before the High Court and claim the vehicle as he"
"cannot be considered an aggrieved party."
"She pointed out further that the correct aggrieved party, if at all, has not gone"
"before the High Court and hence, the judgement by the learned High Court Judge"
"was correct. It was her view that the said judgement as well as the order of the"
"learned Magistrate needs no interference by this Court."
"The  petitioner  has  gone  before  the  High  Court  of  Kandy  on the  basis  of  being"
"aggrieved  by  the  order  pronounced  by  the  learned  Magistrate  of  Dambulla  in"
"Magistrate  Court  of  Dambulla  Case  No-72361,  where  the  vehicle  which  is  the"
"subject matter of this action was confiscated."
"There cannot be any argument that the petitioner was not a claimant before the"
"learned Magistrate, although he was the registered owner of the vehicle at that"
"time. The claimant had been the absolute owner which was a finance company."
"In the case of Wijesinghe vs. Tharmaratnam (Sri Kantha Law Reports) Vol IV"
"page  47,  it  was  held  that  revision  is  a  discretionary  remedy  and  will  not  be"
"available  unless  the  application  discloses  circumstances  which  shocks  the"
"conscience of the Court."
