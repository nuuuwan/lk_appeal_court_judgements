"witness was not aware of the name of the Appellant at all material points."
"But in the cross examination PW2 stated that she was well aware of the name"
"of the Appellant as the deceased had told her everything about her affair with"
"the Appellant. Further the Appellant had come to her house twice in the"
"a
bsence of the deceased. She had also stated that as she was disturbed due"
"to the disappearance of the deceased, she could not mention all the details"
"in  her  statement  to  the  police.  Hence  it  is  incorrect  to  say  that  she  was"
"unaware of the Appellant. Hence the marked contradictions V1 and V2 will"
"not affect the root of the case."
"T
he  counsel  for  the  Appellant  contends  that  the  utterance  made  by  the"
"Appellant  to  PW2  creates  a  reasonable  doubt  as  PW2  had  not  mentioned"
"about the utterance of the Appellant in her first statement to the police but"
"mentioned  it  for  the  first  time  in  her  2nd  statement  which  was  made  after"
"about five months of the incident. Further no explanation had offered for the"
"delay."
"P
W2 mother of the deceased in her  evidence had stated that she was in a"
"state of shock when she gave her first statement to the police. She had given"
"all the details when she gave her statement after finding the dead body of the"
"deceased. Hence, the witness had given valid reasons for the delay in giving"
"a detailed statement."
"I
n the case of Sumanasena V. Attorney General [1999] 3 SLR 137 it was"
"held that:"
"â€œJust  because  the  witness  is  belated  witness  ought  not  to  reject  his"
"testimony on that score alone, court must inquire into the reason for the"
"delay and if the reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable the court"
"could act on the evidence of a belated witness."""
