"September 1991 (“P2a”- AD/35/ES/461/496) under Section 19(2) of the Land Development"
"Ordinance No. 19 of 1935, as amended. The 3rd Petitioner avers that he resides on the"
"land,  with  his  family,  under  a  permit  issued  to  his  late  father  in  April  1980  (“P3a”-"
"AD/35/ES/322/211). This too is a permit to occupy the land concerned under the Crown"
"Lands Ordinance."
"The 1st Petitioner was served with a Quit Notice (“P5a”) on 24th June 2020. The"
"Notice was dated 28th February 2020. She was ordered to vacate the land on or before 25th"
"July 2020. The 2nd and 3rd Petitioners were also each served with Quit Notices dated 28th"
"February 2020, respectively “P6a” and “P7a”, on the same day as the 1st Petitioner and"
"were ordered to vacate the respective lands in question by 25th July 2020."
"The Respondents, rejecting the contention that the Petitioners have valid permits,"
"state  that  the  Petitioners  are  illegal  occupiers  of  a  State  forest  land  falling  within  the"
"purview of the Department of Forests and that they do not have any right to occupy the"
"lands concerned as they do not hold valid permits. Later, however, when this matter was"
"taken up in Court on 22nd November 2022, for the Respondents to support their motion"
"dated 15th November, it was conceded that the Quit Notice issued to the 2nd Petitioner is"
"not valid, as the permit was not cancelled, and that the Respondents will not be pursuing"
"that Quit Notice issued to the 2nd Petitioner."
"The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, as amended provides"
"for an expeditious method of recovery of “state lands” without the State being forced to go"
"through a very cumbersome process of a protracted civil action and consequent appeals"
"(Vide L.H.M.B.B. Herath v. Morgan Engineering [2013] 1 SLR 222). According to Section"
"3(1) of the Act, where a competent authority forms an opinion that any land is State land"
"and that a person is in unauthorised possession or occupation of that land, the competent"
"authority may serve a notice (referred to as a “Quit Notice”) on such person requiring such"
"person  to  vacate  that  land  and  to  deliver  vacant  possession  of  that  land.  This  Section"
"reads:"
