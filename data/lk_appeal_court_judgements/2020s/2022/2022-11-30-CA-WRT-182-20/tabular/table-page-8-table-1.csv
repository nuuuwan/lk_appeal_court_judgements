"The second rule is that those who would be affected by the outcome of the writ application"
"should be made respondents to the application….”"
"In the instant application, the decisions sought to be impugned were made by the"
"1st Respondent in his capacity as the competent authority. The issue before us is whether"
"he correctly formed an opinion that the land was state land and that the occupants were"
"not in lawful occupation. It is this action of the competent authority and not the Divisional"
"Secretary that is sought to be impugned. The issue does not concern the cancellation of"
"permits. This objection cannot be maintained."
"In relation to the 1st Petitioner, she is occupying the land on a valid annual permit"
"issued  under  the  Crown  Lands  Ordinance.  Assuming  that  the Petitioner  is  holding an"
"annual permit, as contended by her, then she is not entitled to the relief prayed for as"
"there is no documentation on record to show that this permit has been renewed, and that"
"it was valid at the time of service of the Quit Notice."
"In relation to the 2nd Petitioner, the permit on which the land was alienated to her"
"does not appear to be cancelled. The Respondent’s initial contention that the Petitioner is"
"in illegal occupation is merely a bare assertion, with no material to substantiate it. There"
"is no basis for the issuance of the Quit Notice, as the 2nd Petitioner does not fall within"
"the class of persons to whom the Act would be applicable. As mentioned above, the learned"
"Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Respondents gave an undertaking"
"that the Quit Notice issued to the 2nd Petitioner would be withdrawn."
"This judgment does not in any way prevent revocation or cancellation of the permit"
"if  the  land  concerned  is  forest  land  and  one  which  should  be  preserved.  It  is  for  the"
"Respondents to act in accordance with the due process of law by taking steps to do so."
"However,  we  urge  that  as  indicated  in  the  journal  entries  of  the  Fundamental  Rights"
"Application  (annexed  to  the  Petition  as  “P4b”)  an  amicable  settlement  is  reached  by"
"allocation of suitable alternate land, since the Petitioner is dispossessed through no fault"
"of her own."
"In respect of the 3rd Petitioner, we are unable to reach a conclusion in his favour."
"This is because his occupation of the land is, on his own admission, on the strength of a"
"permit issued to his father under the Crown Lands Ordinance. The permit, in terms of"
"the  fifth  condition,  is  personal  to  the  permit  holder.  Section  16  of  the  Crown  Lands"
"Ordinance reads:"
