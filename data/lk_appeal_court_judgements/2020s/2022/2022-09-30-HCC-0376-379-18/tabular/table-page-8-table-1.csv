"PW2 in her evidence before the High Court stated that on the date of incident"
"about seven persons had entered her house and dragged the deceased out of"
"her house. Although she had said that she identified 1st and 4th Appellants"
"at  that  time,  she  had  given  some  evidence  that  was  contradictory  to  the"
"evidence given by her in the examination-in-chief."
"In  the  non-summary  inquiry  PW2  had  said  that  two  persons  entered  her"
"house and one had attacked the deceased with a sword. This contradiction"
"was marked as 1V-13."
"Further she had told the police that Chuti had attacked the deceased inside"
"her house. This contradiction was marked as 1V-14."
"In the contradiction marked as 1V-16, PW2 had told the police that she had"
"clutched Chuti to prevent the deceased being attacked by Chuti."
"At the inquest PW2 had said that Chuti had cut the deceased with the sword"
"and whereby the sword had  landed on the deceased. These contradictions"
"were marked as 1V-17 and 18."
"In  the  non-summary  inquiry  PW2  had  stated  that  the  1st  Appellant  had"
"attacked the deceased with a sword. This contradiction was marked as 1V-"
"19."
"But  in  the  High  Court  PW2  had  said  that  she  did  not  see  a  sword  in  the"
"hands  of  the  1st  Appellant.  Further  her  position  in  the  trial  was  that  the"
"persons who entered her house dragged the deceased out and took him to"
"the “Palu Watta”. Nothing was mentioned about the deceased being attacked"
"with a sword inside the house and PW2 trying to prevent the 1st Appellant"
"attacking the deceased."
"Two omissions in respect of the 4th Appellant had been brought to the notice"
"of the court during the trial. In the first omission PW2 had not revealed the"
"identity  of  the  4th  Appellant  to  the  police.  Further  she  had  not  mentioned"
"anything about the 4th Appellant during the inquest proceedings."
