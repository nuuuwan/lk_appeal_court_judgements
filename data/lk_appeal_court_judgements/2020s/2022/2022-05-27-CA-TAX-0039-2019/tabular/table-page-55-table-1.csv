"[156]  The  guiding  principle 
is  that  the  Assessor  or  the  Commissioner"
"General  must  be  satisfied  where 
the  Appellant  has  done  business"
"operations  to  earn  the  profits,  how  it  has  done  its  business  operations"
"which produced the profits and where its business partners and customers"
"were located in the course of doing offshore business. In the present case,"
"although the goods were purchased and sold outside Sri Lanka, the entire"
"turnover had been remitted to Sri Lanka by the buyers (p. 74 of the brief)"
"and NOT by any employee, agent or representative of the Appellant located"
"outside Sri Lanka.  This is also suggestive of the fact that payments are not"
"directly sent by the buyers to the Appellant’s offshore agents  or offshore"
"bank, but direct to the Appellant’s bank located in Sri Lanka."
"[157] A perusal of  the financial statement relating  to the profits  and loss"
"accounts  for  the  period  April  1,  2011  to  March  31,  2012  reveals  that  the"
"Appellant’s  has  deducted employee benefit expenses such as  wages and"
"salaries and contribution plans (schedule 11). This is also suggestive of the"
"fact that local employees are handling business operations from Sri Lanka"
"whereas no material has been presented by the Appellant that employees"
"or  agents  or  representatives  of  the  Appellant  are 
involved 
in  foreign"
"locations to handle the business outside Sri Lanka."
"[158]  Another  factor  that  determines  the  offshore  business  of  a  trading"
"company is that goods are not manufactured or produced in Sri Lanka or"
"imported into Sri Lanka for trading purposes. The Tax Appeals Commission"
"has taken the view that the Appellant is also involved in local sales as sales"
"of some of the items take place in Sri Lanka and therefore, the Appellant is"
"not involved in offshore business as specified in Section 13(b)(ii) of the IRA"
"(pp 147 of the TAC brief)."
"[159] The Appellant states that it is involved in both local sales and offshore"
"sales  (paragraph  62  of  the  written  submissions  and  the  statement  of"
"account at page 90 of the TAC brief) and that the local sale component has"
"been  taxed  in  Sri  Lanka.  It  was  the  contention  of  Dr.  Felix  that  the  tax"
"exemption claimed only related to the offshore business and there is no"
"prohibition for one entity to have a local business and an offshore business."
"His  contention  was  that  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  has  erred  when  it"
"made a reference to the local sales taking place in Sri Lanka as admittedly"
"there are no undeclared sales. The Assistant Commissioner having perused"
"the commercial documents has found that only the goods are transferred"
"(purchase  and  sale)  outside  Sri  Lanka  by  the  Appellant  and  all  other"
