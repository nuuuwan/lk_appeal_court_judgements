"a project of any construction company, which continues for more than 183"
"days, such a project may be considered a PE in Sri Lanka."
"Agency PE"
"[103] In the case of agency PE, the enterprise (India) in the other country,"
"(Sri Lanka) can be a person, without a fixed place, who is appointed as an"
"agent in Sri Lanka and is vested with authority to regularly act or habitually"
"exercise the authority on its behalf and to conduct business and conclude"
"contracts in the name of the enterprise."
"[104] As far as this case is concerned, the relevant PE is the fixed place of"
"business and Article 5 of the DTAA provides a list of positive examples of"
"fixed  base  PE,  including  a  place  of  management,  a  branch,  an  office,  a"
"factory or a workshop etc. It is not in dispute that the Appellant company is"
"a  non-resident  company,  but  has  a  branch  in  Sri  Lanka  (Johnson  &"
"Johnson Ltd (Sri Lanka Branch), No. 11, Castle Lane, Colombo 04 and it has"
"been registered as a company in Sri Lanka (pp. 1-2,5, 10, 32, 74).  According"
"to  the  Company  Registrar’s  Certificate  as  indicated  in  the  Respondents"
"reasons for the determination (p. 10), the Appellant company’s branch has"
"been registered under Section 3 (2) of the Companies (Special Provisions)"
"Act, No. 19 of 1974 and its principal place of business in Sri Lanka is at No."
"41, 
Janadhiipathi  Mawatha,  Colombo  01(as  per 
its  Memorandum  of"
"Association and Articles of Association)."
"[105]  Accordingly,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  Appellant  is  a  non-resident"
"company having a branch office in Sri Lanka and it is earning its profits and"
"income from its business in Sri Lanka through a permanent establishment."
"Accordingly, 
the  Appellant  company  can  be 
treated  as  a  permanent"
"establishment (PE) with a registered branch office in Sri Lanka within the"
"meaning of Article 5 of the DTAA between India and Sri Lanka. Accordingly,"
"the Appellant company is subject to taxation in Sri Lanka on the profits of"
"a  business  carried  on  in  Sri  Lanka,  through  a  permanent  establishment"
"located in Sri Lanka."
"Non-discrimination clause in the DTAA"
"[106]  The  next  question 
is  whether  the  Appellant  who  carried  on 
its"
"business  through  a  permanent  establishment  in  Sri  Lanka  can  also  fall"
"within the non-discrimination clause under the DTAA so as to qualify for the"
"treaty  benefits  subject  to  the  stipulations  of  the  other  provisions  of  the"
"DTAA read with the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006."
