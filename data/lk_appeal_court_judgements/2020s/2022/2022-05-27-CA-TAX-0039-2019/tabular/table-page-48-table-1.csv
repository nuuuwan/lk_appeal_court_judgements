"[
133]  It 
is  necessary,  however,  to  consider  these  two  different  factual"
"findings and the statement of law made by the  Tax Appeals Commission"
"separately. Dr. Felix argued at the hearing that the Appellant is an overseas"
"company  and  not  an  offshore  company  and  therefore,  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission  has  confused  the  notion  of  an  offshore  company  with  an"
"overseas company which can also do offshore business. He further argued"
"that the exemption under Section 13 (b)(ii) is not confined to an offshore"
"company  but  is  available  to  an  overseas  company  such  as  the  Appellant"
"doing any offshore business."
"Offshore Company & Overseas Company"
"[134]  In  view  of  this  argument,  it  is  necessary  first  to  understand  the"
"distinction between an offshore company and an overseas company. The"
"term  “offshore”  refers  to  any  activity  that  takes  place  outside  an  entity's"
"home base (off the coast) or any location outside of one's home country"
"and therefore, the term “offshore business”  ” refers to any business that"
"takes  place 
in  another  country-off 
the  coast 
(Investopedia,  Offshore"
"Definition, https://www.investopedia.com)."
"Offshore Company"
"[135] An  offshore company is not  defined in the Companies  Act No. 7 of"
"2007. 
In 
terms  of  Section  261  of 
the  Companies  Act,  any  company"
"incorporated  outside 
Sri 
Lanka  may  make  an 
application 
for 
the"
"registration of an offshore company in accordance with Part XI under the"
"provisions of the Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007. An offshore company shall"
"have the power to carry on any business outside Sri Lanka, but shall not be"
"entitled to carry on any trading business within Sri Lanka (s. 264). Thus, no"
"tax  consequence  may  arise  depending  on  the  place  where  the  offshore"
"activity takes place and the nature of the offshore activity.  In the present"
"case,  however,  the  question  of  whether  the  Appellant 
is  an  offshore"
"company or its tax liability does not arise for consideration."
