"Appellant  sought 
the  Mutual  Agreement  procedure, 
the  Competent"
"Authority could have sought additional information from the non-resident"
"company and the Competent Authority in India to ensure similar levels of"
"compliance and verification, including transfer pricing-related inquiries."
"[76] The Appellant did not bring to the attention of the Assessor the non-"
"discrimination provision in Article 25 of the DTAA between  India and  Sri"
"Lanka while filing its return of income (See- returns of Income at pp. 44-47"
"of  the  TAC  brief).  Alternatively,  the  Appellant  did  not  invoke  the  non-"
"discrimination  provision  by  making  an  application  to  the  Competent"
"Authority,  even  after 
filing  the  returns  of 
income  through  a  Mutual"
"Agreement  Procedure.  The  Appellant,  however,  only 
relied  on 
the"
"exemption  under  Section  13  (b)(ii)  of  the  IRA,  2006  and  accordingly,  the"
"Assessor did not accept the returns on the basis that the Appellant being"
"a  non-resident  company  is  not  entitled  to  claim  the  exemption  under"
"Section 13 (b)(ii) of the IRA, 2006."
"[77]  The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  Commissioner  General  against  the"
"assessment  made  by  the  Assessor  but  did  not  claim  the  benefit  of  the"
"DTAA between India and Sri Lanka as a ground of appeal (p.22 of the TAC"
"brief). 
The  Appellant  being  dissatisfied  with 
the  decision  of 
the"
"Commissioner  General  in  its  appeal  to  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  for"
"the first time raised a question of law to the effect that the Appellant is"
"entitled to the tax exemption conferred under section 13 (b)(ii) of the IRA"
"2006 read in conjunction with the provisions of the  DTAA between India"
"and Sri Lanka (Vide- question of law at page 30 of the TAC brief)."
"[78] The Respondent did not object to this question of law being raised by"
"the  Appellant  for  the  first  time  before  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission."
"Moreover, the Respondent made oral and written submissions (pp. 110-"
"111  of  the  TAC  brief)  and  took  up  the  position  that  the  exemption  is"
"granted only to a resident company in order to raise the foreign currency"
"in  Sri  Lanka,  and  the  treatment  of  the  Appellant  being  a  non-resident"
"company  in  similar  circumstances  or  similar  activities  is  different  and"
"therefore, the DTAA cannot apply to the Appellant (p. 111 of the TAC brief)."
