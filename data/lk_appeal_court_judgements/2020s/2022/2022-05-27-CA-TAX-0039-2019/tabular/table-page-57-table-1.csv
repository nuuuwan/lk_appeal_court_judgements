"“The law is well settled that a person who claims an exemption or"
"concession has to establish that he is entitled to that exemption or"

"exceptions depending upon the settings on which the provision has"
"been placed in the statute and the object and purpose to be achieved."
"I
f

"conditions have to be complied with....”"
