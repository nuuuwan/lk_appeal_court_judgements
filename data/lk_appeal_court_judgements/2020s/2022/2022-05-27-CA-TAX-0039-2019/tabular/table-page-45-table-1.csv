"Comparison  Test 
for 
the  application  of 
the  non-discrimination"
"provision"
"[124]  For 
the  application  of 
the  non-discrimination  provision 
to  a"
"permanent establishment, the test is that the comparison must be made"
"between  a  hypothetical  resident  person  in  Sri  Lanka  and  a  permanent"
"establishment 
(non-resident  person-Indian  Company-Appellant).  Under"
"this test, both the resident and the non-resident must be engaged in the"
"same  business  activities  and  operate  in  the  same  circumstances  (by  the"
"application of the ordinary tax laws, regulations, both in law and fact) under"
"the same conditions (imposition-receipt) and exemptions/deductions from"
"income tax under the domestic law of the source State."
"[125] This principle requires that the permanent establishmentsâ€™ business"
"activities shall be compared with the similar business activities (same type"
"of business) of the hypothetical resident person, and if both are involved in"
"similar business activities, the non-resident shall not be treated differently"
"or  both  resident  and  non-resident  shall  be  treated 
in  the  same  way."
"Secondly, by the application of the ordinary tax laws and regulations, both"
"law  and  fact,  the  comparison  must  be  made  between  the  permanent"
"establishment and the hypothetical resident company to ascertain whether"
"they  are  in  the  same  circumstances.  If  the  domestic  tax  law/regulations"
"subject a permanent establishment to additional taxation compared to a"
"hypothetical resident placed under the same circumstances in the source"
"country, the non-discrimination provision in Article 25 may be attracted."
"[126] Thirdly, the test also requires a comparison to be made between a"
"permanent  establishment  and  a  hypothetical  resident  company  with"
"regard  to  the  imposition  and  exemptions  of  the  tax  liability  to  ascertain"
"whether  the  two  can  be  placed  under  the  same  conditions.  If  both  are"
"placed under  the same conditions, a permanent establishment,  shall not"
"be 
treated  differently  as  both  hypothetical 
resident  and  permanent"
"establishment (non-residents) shall be treated in the same way."
"Comparison 
between 
the 
permanent 
establishment 
and 
the"
"hypothetical resident company"
"[127]  The  comparison  between  the  permanent  establishment  and  the"
"hypothetical resident company for the purpose of affording relief from the"
"non-discrimination clause of the DTAA, shall be thus, made subject to the"
"imposition  and  limitations  laid  down  in  the  domestic  law  of  the  source"
"country subject  further, to the extent of inconsistency with Treaty terms."
