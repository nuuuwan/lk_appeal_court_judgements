"is carrying on business in Sri Lanka through a branch or agency, and if so,"
"the Sri Lankan tax will apply. Where a double taxation treaty applies, the"
"test  is  replaced  by  the  “permanent  establishment’  criterion-i.e.,  does  the"
"foreign 
trader  has  sufficient  presence 
in  Sri  Lanka 
to  constitute  a"
"permanent  establishment.  The 
test 
then 
is  whether

"[143] In this regard, it is significant to remember that the DTAA does not in"
"any way confine the powers of the Assessor under the Inland Revenue Act,"
"with regard to any assessment of assessee covered by the permission of"
"Indo-Sri  Lanka  DTAA.  A  DTAA  does  not  create  a  separate 
taxation."
"Accordingly, a DTAA cannot be used to impose any new tax on a person or"
"company when the domestic law imposes no tax.  In short, any DTAA acts"
"only as a shield against double taxation, and not as a sword to impose tax,"
"which  is  not  imposed  under  such  domestic  law  (Maralynne  A.  Monteith,"

"[144] The object of the agreement is ""for the avoidance of double taxation"
"and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and"
"on capital.  The resulting position is that the Assessor or the Commissioner"
"General in Sri Lanka on its own cannot lawfully impose or waive or exempt"
"or reduce any tax imposed by Parliament except to the extent and in the"
"manner permitted by the Inland Revenue Act itself."
"[145]  As  the  Commentary  points  out,  the  provision  covering  permanent"
"establishment is based on situs and not on nationality, so that the benefit"
"of the non-discrimination clause applies to all residents of a treaty country"
"who,  regardless  of  nationality,  have  a  permanent  establishment 
(e.g.,"
"branch) in the other country (Commentary on OECD Model, Article 24)."

"[146] The Appellant’s contention is that the Appellant, comparatively placed"
"in 
the  same  circumstances,  with  a  hypothetical  resident  company 
is"
"engaged 
in  the  same  activities  and  therefore,  the  Appellant  being  a"
"permanent  establishment,  shall  not  be  discriminated  and  treated 
less"
