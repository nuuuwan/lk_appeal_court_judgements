"[51]  Article  148  of  the  Constitution  explicitly  lays  down  that  Parliament"
"shall  have  full  control  over  public  finance  and  no  tax  shall  be  imposed"
"except by or under the authority of law passed by Parliament. Article 148"
"deals with the imposition of tax only with the authority of law passed by"
"Parliament. It is relevant to note that a taxation statute imposes, or levies"
"a  tax  on 
its  citizens  and business entities  and  comprises  of  charging"
"sections  and  machinery  provisions  and  provisions 
laying  down 
the"
"procedure to assess the tax and penalties, the method of their collection"
"and provisions to prevent avoidance of revenue."
"[52]  On  the  other  hand,  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act  is  not  a  fiscal"
"statute that imposes taxes, fees, duties etc. It is a statute that regulates the"
"procedure to be followed in hearing and disposing of appeals in respect of"
"matters relating to imposition of any tax, levy, charge, duty or penalty. Its"
"powers are limited to the confirmation, increase, reduction or annulment"
"of 
the  assessment  as  determined  by 
the  Commissioner-General  or"
"remitting  the  to  the  Commissioner-General  with  the  decision  of  the"
"Commission on such appeal (Section 9 (10). Accordingly, I am not inclined"
"to agree with the submission made by Dr. Felix."
"Impossibility of adhering to the time limit provision"
"[53]  Apart  from  the  absence  of  reference  to  penal  sanction  and  other"
"consequences  of  non-compliance  of  Section  10, 
the 
impossibility  of"
"adhering to the time limit provision is also a factor in influencing the court"
"to construe the time limit provision is not mandatory, but as directory only."
"It is common ground that the appeal was made by the Appellant to the Tax"
"Appeals  Commission  on  20.10.2016  under  Section  8  of  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission Act and the initial hearing was fixed for 24.05.2018 (p. 84 of"
"the  TAC  brief).  The  proceedings  on  24.05.2018  however,  reveal  that  the"
"Appellant moved for a postponement of the hearing on the ground that"
"its authorized representative was unable to come for hearing. The hearing"
"was  re-fixed  for  18.10.2018  but  the  hearing  could  not  be  conducted  on"
"18.10.2018 as the one-year time period of the members of the Tax Appeals"
"Commission  expired  on  02.07.2018,  and  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission"
"informed the parties that once the members are appointed, they will be"
"informed of the next date for hearing of the appeal (P. 86 of the brief)."
