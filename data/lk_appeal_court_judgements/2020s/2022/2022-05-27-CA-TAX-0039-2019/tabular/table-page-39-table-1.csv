"[107] It was the contention of Dr. Felix that the Appellant is taxable in India"
"in respect of profits earned in India and the Appellant has duly paid income"
"tax in India in respect of all profits earned in India. Then, he submitted that"
"the Appellant is also taxable in Sri Lanka in respect of profits attributable to"
"its permanent establishment in Sri Lanka subject to the tax laws of Sri Lanka"
"by virtue of the non-discrimination clause in Article 25 of the DTTA."
"[108]  The

"of  the  two  States  are  comparably  placed  or  that  two  persons  similarly"
"situated  must  be  treated  similarly  (Taxmann’s 
Indian  Double  Taxation"
"Agreements & Tax Laws, Vol. 1, 2004, para 30.3). The principal object is to"
"forbid discrimination or unequal treatment in situations which are identical"
"or comparable, and the principle requires that similar situations shall not"
"be treated differently unless differentiation is objectively justified (supra)."
"[110] Article 25 of the DTAA between India and Sri Lanka also deals with the"
"elimination  of  tax  discrimination  in  certain  precise  circumstances  and  it"
