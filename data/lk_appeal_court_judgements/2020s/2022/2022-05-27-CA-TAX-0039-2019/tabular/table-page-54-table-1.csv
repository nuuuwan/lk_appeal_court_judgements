"were  made  (see- Grainger and Son v. Gough [(1896).  A.C. 325] where all","",""
"orders","for  French  wine  and  champagne","from  U.K.  customers  were"

"wine firm. It was held that because the contracts for the sale of wine and","",""
"champagne  were  concluded  in  France,  the  French  firm  was  only  trading","",""
"with  and  not  within  the  U.K.  The  mere  production  of  some  documents","",""

contracts

"which the profits in question arise (Greenwood v. F.L. Smith and Co., 8 T.C.","",""

"[(1957) 1 All E.R. 561] where the US parent company (Akron) had a wholly-","",""

"agreements with its foreign distributors for the supply of Tires, which were","",""
"manufactured and delivered direct from the U.K. by Brentford. It was held","",""
"that  although  the  main  contract  was  located  outside  the  U.K.  Akron  was","",""
"trading in the U.K. through Brenford as its agent. The case highlights that","",""
"the  crucial  factor  was  not  the  contract  itself,  but  the  dealings  between","",""
"Brentford and the foreign distributor and therefore, Akron’s profits in the","",""

"[155] I think that the crucial question thus is: where do the operations take","",""

"to answer that question, the Appellant must present credible documentary","",""
