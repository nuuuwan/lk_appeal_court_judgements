"the Treaty provisions would prevail, and are liable to be enforced in Sri"
"Lanka and India."
"Was the Appellant having a “permanent establishment” in Sri Lanka?"
"[93] The next point that arises is whether the Appellant company being a"
"non-resident  company  carried  on  business 
in  Sri  Lanka 
through  a"
"""permanent establishment"" (PE) which can be taxed in Sri Lanka by virtue"
"of the application of Article 5 of the DTAA between India and Sri Lanka. It"
"was  the  submission  of  Dr.  Felix  that  the  Appellant  has  a  permanent"
"establishment (PE) in Sri Lanka in terms of Article 5 (2)(b) of the DTAA, and"
"therefore, the Appellant is taxable in respect of profits earned in India and"
"further, the Appellant is subject to the provisions of the Inland Revenue"
"Act 
in 
respect  of  profits  or 
income  attributable 
to 
its  permanent"
"establishment (PE) in Sri Lanka, irrespective of whether the Appellant is"
"non-resident company in Sri Lanka."
"[94] By virtue of Article 7 (1) of the DTAA, the profits of an enterprise of a"
"Contracting State shall be taxable only in that Contracting State unless the"
"enterprise carries  on business in the  other  Contracting  State through a"
"permanent establishment (PE) situated therein. It further provides inter"
"a
l
i
a
,
 that if the enterprise carries on business through a PE, the profits of"
"the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them"
"as 
is  attributable  to  that  PE 
in  Sri  Lanka.  Thus,  where  a  company"
"incorporated  in  India  carries  on  business  through  PE  in  Sri  Lanka,  its"
"business income may be taxable in Sri Lanka to the extent to which it is"
"attributable to such PE in Sri Lanka. The same principle applies where a"
"company  incorporated  in  Sri  Lanka  carries  on  business  through  PE  in"
"India, its business income may be taxable in India to the extent to which"
"it is attributable to such PE in India on the basis of parity of status."
"Permanent Establishment (PE)"
"[95] The word ""permanent establishment"" is, of course, a concept created"
"by the DTAA for tax purposes and it can be described as a taxable entity"
"which is commonly used in all international Double Taxation Avoidance"
"standard  O.E.C.D  or  UN  Model  and 
their 
Agreements,  based  on"
"commentaries. Article 5 (1) defines the term “permanent establishment”"
"as a “fixed place of business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried"
"on”. It reads as follows”"
