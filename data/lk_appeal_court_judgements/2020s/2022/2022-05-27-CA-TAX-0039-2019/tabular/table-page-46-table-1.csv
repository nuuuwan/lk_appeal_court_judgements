"This  also  means  that  where  the  provisions  of  the  domestic  tax  law  are"
"inconsistent  with  the  provisions  of  the  DTAA,  the  provisions  of  the  DTAA"
"will prevail."
"[128] All what is required is that the provisions of the domestic tax law, shall"
"be

"to  be  unreasonable,  arbitrary  or  irrelevant  to  the  object  sought  to  be"
"achieved by the DTAA. In the Indian Case of Automated Securities v. ACIT"
"118 TTJ 618 (ITAT Pune), this principle was recognized as follows:"
