"1R5 only refers to 4 houses situated at ‘Single Tree’. It does not refer to the soil"
"covered by those houses. Therefore, it appears that only the buildings had been"
"transferred  to  the  Central  Provincial  Council.  According  to  the  contents  of  the"
"documents marked 1R9, 1R10 it is clear that the title to the soil covered by those"
"houses still remains with the LRC and the Central Provincial Council is planning to"
"acquire those soil rights. From the contents of the documents marked 1R10 and"
"1R11 
it 
is  apparent  that  LRC  had  consented  to  the  eviction  of  the  unlawful"
"occupants from those houses and agreed that the Central Provincial Council should"
"take appropriate steps under the provisions of the Government Quarters (Recovery"
"of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969."
"The 3rd Respondent LRC has not denied this position. Although the LRC still owns"
"the soil rights covered by these buildings these are not applications made under"
"the  provisions  of  the  State  Lands  (Recovery  of  Possession)  Act.  Therefore,  the"
"ownership  to  the  soil  covered  by  these  buildings  becomes  irrelevant  to  these"
"proceedings. Section 9 of the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act"
"No.  7  of  1969  (as  amended)  defines  “Government  quarters”  as  follows,  ”any"
"building or room or other accommodation occupied for the use of residence which"
"is provided by or on behalf of the Government or any public corporation to any"
"person and including any land or premises in which such building or room or other"
"accommodation 
is  situated,  but  does  not 
include  any  house  provided  by  the"
"Commissioner for National Housing to  which Part V of the National Housing Act"
"applies”."
"Once these houses are transferred to the Central Provincial Council, they become"
"buildings or accommodation occupied for the use of residence which is provided"
"by  or  on  behalf  of  the  government  or  any  public  corporation.  The  definition  of"
"“Government quarters” includes not only the buildings (houses) but also the land"
"or premises in which such buildings are situated. Therefore, the Central Provincial"
"Council 
is  empowered  to 
institute  action  under  this  Act  for  the  recovery  of"
"possession of these residences irrespective of the fact that they stand on the land"
"belonging to the LRC."
"According  to  the  definition  contained  in  Section  9  of  the  Government  Quarters"
"(Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969 (as amended), “competent authority”"
"means 
the  Secretary 
to 
the  Ministry 
charged  with 
the 
subject  of  Public"
