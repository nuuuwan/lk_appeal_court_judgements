"I
t is apparent from this question that the fact of not handing over the"
"baby on that particular night by the appellant has not been disputed"
"by  the  appellant.  Therefore,  under  any  circumstances,  the  appellant"
"cannot take up the position at the end of the case that the baby was"
"handed over to the PW2. Therefore, necessarily the said position taken"
"up  at  the  end  of  the  case,  when  the  accused-appellant  was  giving"
"evidence  could  not  be  believed  and  had  to  be  rejected.  Then  the"
"circumstantial  evidence  led  in  this  case  invites  to  come  to  the  only"
"conclusion  that  no  one  else  but  the  appellant  has  committed  the"
"murder of the baby girl."
