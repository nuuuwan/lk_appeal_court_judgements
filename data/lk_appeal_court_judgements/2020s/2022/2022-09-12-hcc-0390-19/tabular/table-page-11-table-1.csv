"the  charge.  The  motive  which  induces  a  man  to  do  a  particular  act  is"
"known to him and him alone. Therefore, the prosecution is not bound to"
"prove a motive for the offence, though it can suggest a motive, and when"
"it does so, the judge or jury can examine it. Where there is clear evidence"
"that a person has committed an offence, it is immaterial that no motive"
"has  been  proved,  or  that  the  evidence  of  motive  in  not  clear.‚Äù  (See-"
"Emperor Vs. Balaram Das 49 Cal. 358)."
"Therefore,  it  is  not  necessary  to  prove  the  motive  at  all.  A  conviction  is"
"possible without any motive being disclosed."
