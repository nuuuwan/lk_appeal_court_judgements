"of the attack. It has been proved that the evidence of the witnesses is truthful"
"and trustworthy in that regard. I am unable to find any basis to the argument"
"that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the evidence as to the"
"dying  depositions  in  its  correct  perspective.  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  learned"
"High Court Judge had well considered the evidence with a clear understanding"
"of the relevant legal principles."
"I find no basis at all in the ground of appeal that the nexus between the injury"
"and  the  cause  of  death  has  not  been  established.  The  postmortem  report"
"marked  P-03  clearly  establishes  that  the  death  had  been  a  result  of  the  stab"
"wound  received  by  the  deceased.  The  evidence  clearly  establishes  that  the"
"injury was inflicted on the deceased by the appellant using a knife. The doctor"
"who  produced  the  postmortem  report  not  expressing  a  clear  opinion  that  the"
"knife marked P-02 may be the weapon used is not a reason to doubt the cause"
"of death."
"I  do  not  find  any  merit  in  the  argument  that  the  appellant  had  no  knowledge"
"and the intention to kill when the attack took place either. The evidence shows"
"that the appellant has been waiting for the deceased knowing very well that the"
"deceased has to go pass the place to reach his house. He had come prepared to"
"attack the deceased. Although it was one wound, according to the post mortem"
"report,  it  has  cut  through  several  vital  organs  of  the  body,  which  has  caused"
"his death. I find that the appellant had the knowledge and the intention when"
"he inflicted the fatal stab wound on the deceased."
"The  law  is  clear  that  the  motive  for  a  crime  is  not  a  matter  that  needs  to  be"
"proved in a criminal trial."
