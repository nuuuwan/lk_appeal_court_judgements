"Citing  the  judgment  in  the  case  of  Ranjith  Vs.  The  State  (2000)  3  SLR  46"
"where it was stated that ordinarily it is not safe to base a conviction for murder"
"solely  upon  a  dying  declaration,  it  was  his  contention  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge  should  have  drawn  his  attention  to  whether  this  was  a  case  that  falls"
"under  the  ambit  of  section  297,  that  is  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to"
"murder."
"The view of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) was that there can be"
"no basis to any of the arguments adduced on behalf of the appellant."
"He  points  out  that  this  was  not  a  conviction  that  relied  solely  on  a  dying"
"declaration, but by an eyewitness account as well as dying declarations made"
"to several persons at different times before his death which occurred two days"
"after  the  stabbing.  He  was  of  the  view  that  the  cause  of  death  has  been  well"
"established in this matter and ambiguity as to the evidence of the doctor who"
"produced  the  postmortem  report  whether  the  knife  marked  P-02  may  be  the"
"weapon used has not created any doubt as to the cause of death and to the fact"
"that the deceased had a stab wound which resulted in his death."
"It was his position that there was no evidence before the trial Court to come to"
"a  finding  that  the  act  of  the  appellant  amounts  to  culpable  homicide  not"
"amounting to murder and the evidence was that this was a preplanned attack"
"on the deceased and nothing else. He points out that the motive to a crime of"
"this nature is not a matter that necessarily needs to be proved."
