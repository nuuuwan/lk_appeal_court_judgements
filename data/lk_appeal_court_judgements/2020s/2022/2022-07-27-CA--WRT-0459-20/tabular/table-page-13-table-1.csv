"පාශණේවය වන බැැංකුව දැඩි මුලය අබණුදයකට ල්වී සනාමැි බව තහවුරැ කර ඇත. තවද පවතී තත්ත්වය 2010"

"It is thus seen that the Arbitrator has relied on some facts and figures presented"
"by  the  employees  and  newspaper  articles  of  a  statement  made  by  the  Governor  of  the"
"Central Bank of Sri Lanka at the time assuring depositors that the financial crisis has"
"been resolved. The Arbitrator further notes that the situation was resolved by the year"
"2010."
"While  it  is  true  that  the  financial  situation  was  resolved  by  2010  and  any"
"catastrophic  consequences  that  could  have  ensued  from  the  crisis  were  mitigated,  the"
"Arbitrator  has  failed  to  address  his  mind  to  how  the  crisis was brought  under  control."
"There  is  no  dispute  whatsoever  that  the  Central  Bank  did  have  to  intervene.  It  is  a"
"common sensical proposition that the Central Bank would have to make such a dramatic"
"intervention only if a  Bank was  facing a  severe  financial  crisis.  The  repercussions  of  a"
"collapse  of  a  Bank will  lead  to  disastrous  consequences  not  only  to the  employees that"
"would have to be made redundant after its bankruptcy but also to depositors who have"
"entrusted their monies to the Bank in confidence. Not to mention the ripple effect on the"
"entire economy of the country. This was executed in terms of Section 30(1) of the Monetary"
"Law Act."
"This Crisis of confidence that Seylan Bank faced was following the collapse of the"
"Golden  Key  Credit  Card  Company,  as  mentioned  above.  Queues  of  depositors  formed"
"outside branches of Seylan Bank to withdraw their deposits. These fears were amplified"
"by the collapse of Pramuka Savings & Development Bank Limited which led to thousands"
"of depositors being rendered helpless not long before this. The entire sordid tale is set out"
"in the “Case Study” (marked “X5”) presented by Seylan Bank. The Case Study sets out"
"the steps taken by the new management, one of which was to reduce the high staffing"
"ratio by lowering the age of retirement to 55 years (p. 42 of the Case Study). Thus, the"
"Circular No. SCL 2009/003 dated 19th March 2009 does not arise in a vacuum."
"The 5th to 52nd Respondents do not deny that there was a crisis. In Paragraph 44"
"of  their  written  submissions,  it  is  noted  that  the  aforementioned  Case  Study  “clearly"
"established” that “the financial crisis was caused by a misunderstanding subsequent to"
"the  collapse  of  the  Golden  Key  company,  which  had  triggered  a  run-on  deposits  of  the"
