"this Court observes that Circular No. SCL 2009/003 is rather similar to Circular No. SCL"
"2001/10. No evidence was forthcoming as to whether Circular No. SCL 2001/10 was issued"
"following consultation of employees. On the other hand, as mentioned below, it transpires"
"that Circular No. SCL 2009/003 was issued following consultation. The relevant portion"
"of these two Circulars will be juxtaposed for the purpose of clarity."
