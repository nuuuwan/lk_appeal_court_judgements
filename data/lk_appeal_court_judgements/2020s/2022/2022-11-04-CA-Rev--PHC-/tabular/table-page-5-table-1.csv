"of appointment specifically stipulates his functions are limited in the eyes of the law, any function"
"done in carrying out duties in an acting capacity is valid as that of a permanent appointee."
"T
he Petitioner had argued that the certificate filed before the Court was not according to the rules"
"of the Wagers Board Ordinance. According to the ordinance, the sum due and to whom that is due"
"should be clearly shown. One of the reasons to do so is to facilitate the owner or employer to show"
"cause, if any."
"I
n  this  case,  the  certificate  filed  in  Court  indicates  the  schedule  of  workers  employed  in  the"
"annexure. The description carries the number of workers to whom payments were not made and"
"the period to which the payments were due. The period was shown as 01.05.2014 to 30.04.2017,"
"and the defaulted amount was Rs.26,430,310.00."
"T
he page ends with that, and the next page is the schedule.   In this schedule, five sections give out"
"the details in numerical order from 1-23, the employee's name, the type of employee, the period"
"for which money was due, and the sum due."
"T
his schedule is part and parcel of the certificate as the certificate used the words to refer to the"
"annexure and the schedule. Anyone can clearly understand the employee, the type of work he did,"
"the amount due to him and the period of default. The acting deputy labour commissioner had duly"
"signed that schedule too. It carries the same date as the certificate. When a document is part and"
"parcel of the certificate, that should be considered the certificate."
"T
he ordinance had not  discussed  whether  an employee is  a skilled labourer or not.  It  had only"
"mentioned  workman.  Therefore,  the  question  of  whether  skilled  or  unskilled  is  not  an  issue  in"
"filing the certificate. The certificate carries the words ""employed in engineering trade""."
"H
owever, in the schedule, 23 workers are described as unskilled under the column type of labourer."
"Therefore, for the purpose of this certificate, the employees are employed in the engineering trade"
"as unskilled labourers who fall within the meaning of worker for whom the ordinance applies."
