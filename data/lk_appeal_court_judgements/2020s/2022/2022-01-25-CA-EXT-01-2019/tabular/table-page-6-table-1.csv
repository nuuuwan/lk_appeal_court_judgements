"The Law"
"At the outset the origin and application of the principles surrounding extradition can be"
"examined. Accordingly, the Attorney General v Ruberoe and Others (1988) 1 SLR 323"
"extensively examined the legislative history of the law on extradition in Sri Lanka:"
"“The Extradition Acts of 1870 and 1873 of the United Kingdom were imported into"
"the local law by the Extradition Ordinance No. 10 of 1877 and by the proclamation"
"of the Governor of Ceylon dated April 03, 1878, the Order-in-Council passed by Her"
"Majesty in Council on February 04, 1878 and published in the Ceylon Government"
"Gazette of April 12, 1878.”"
"In Philip Gordon James Benwell v The Attorney General (1986) 1 SLR 30 His Lordship"
"Justice Atukorale has made the following observations:"
"Our extradition law provides for the extradition of fugitives to and from designated"
"Commonwealth countries and foreign States (called treaty States). Proceedings in"
"extradition  are 
founded  on 
international  obligations  arising  out  of  mutual"
"agreement between different countries. These obligations involve a very high sense"
"of responsibility and commitment on the part of such countries. Extradition law is"
"designed  to  prevent  a  fugitive  who  has  committed  a  crime  in  one  country  from"
"seeking asylum in another to which he has fled to avoid trial and punishment. It"
"rests upon the plainest principles of justice. It is a law which is of vital importance"
"to the public administration of criminal justice as well as to the security of different"
"countries."
"As such, the Extradition Law as applicable in Sri Lanka provides for the processes by"
"which  a  person  may  be  extradited  to  a  foreign  country  after  such  person  has  been"
"committed  to  custody.  After  a 
foreign  nation  makes  an  extradition  request, 
the"
"procedure is set in motion by the provisions of section 8(3) of the Act which delineates"
"the issuance of an Authority to Proceed to a Court of Committal. In Philip Gordon James"
"Benwell  (supra)  the  court  held  that  “Moreover  it  is  not  the  requisition  of  the  Foreign"
"Minister  but  the  authority  to  proceed  issued by  the  appropriate  Minister  of  this  country"
"which empowers the Court of Committal to commence proceedings for the committal of the"
"fugitive.”. Thereafter, under section 9 of the Act, on receipt of an authority to proceed"
