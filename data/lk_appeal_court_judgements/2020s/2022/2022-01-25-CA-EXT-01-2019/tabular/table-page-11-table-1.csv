"Prior to conclusion, this Court wishes to note and highlight the importance in expediting"
"the  inquiry  against  the  appellant.  The  requisition  has  been  made  by  the  Attorney"
"General  of  the  Commonwealth  of  Australia  in  2016  and  the  issue  of  whether  the"
"appellant  should  be  extradited  or  not  is  yet  to  be  concluded.  In  fact,  the  matter  is"
"pending without any development. As examined at the beginning, extradition involves"
"international obligations based on principles of reciprocity and mutual benefit. It is a"
"matter dealing with mutual legal assistance and as such it is the reciprocal duty of Sri"
"Lanka  authorities  to  assist  the  requesting  nation  with  the  utmost  diligence  thereby"
"cementing goodwill. Any undue delay in such a matter cannot be condoned in any sense."
"This Court hereby orders the inquiry pending before the High Court of Colombo in case"
"no. HC 47/17 be given priority and to be concluded expeditiously."
"Appeal dismissed."
