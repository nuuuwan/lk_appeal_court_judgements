"In this case when the prosecution led evidence of the victim, she had deviated"
"her stance taken in the complaint lodged against the Appellant. After leading"
"some evidence, as she did not come out with the prosecutionâ€™s version, on"
"an  application  by  the  prosecution  the  victim  was  remanded.  When  her"
"evidence  resumed  after  the  remand,  she  again  adopted  the  same  evasive"
"attitude towards the prosecution case. Hence, an application was made by"
"the  prosecuting  counsel  under  Section  154  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  to"
"question PW1."
