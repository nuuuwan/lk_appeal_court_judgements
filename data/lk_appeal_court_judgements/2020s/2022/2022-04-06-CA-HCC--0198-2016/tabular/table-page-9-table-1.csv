"In Samaraweera v. AG [1990] 1 SLR 256 the court held that:"
"“The  maxim  falsus  in  uno  falsus  in  omnibus  (could  not  be  applied  in"
"such  circumstances)  …  the  credibility  of  witnesses  can  be  treated  as"
"divisible and accepted against one and rejected against another. The jury"
"or judge must decide for themselves whether that part of the testimony"
"which is found to be false taints the whole or whether the false can safely"
"be separated from the true.”"
