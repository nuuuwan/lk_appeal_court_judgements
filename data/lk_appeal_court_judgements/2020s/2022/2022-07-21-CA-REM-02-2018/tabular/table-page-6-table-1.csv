"Admiralty  jurisdiction  may  be  exercised  in  personam  or  in  rem.  In  personam"
"actions proceed against the person concerned directly. This type of claim is essentially no"
"different to an ordinary claim in a civil court. In contrast, the action in rem comprises a"
"unique form of action that is directed against the ship, and not the ship owner (vide The"
"Bold Buccleugh 7 Moo PC 267) This type of action which is unique to the law of Admiralty"
"was defined by Sir George Jessel M.R. in the City of Mecca (1881) 6 PD 106 thus:"
"“You may in England and in most countries proceed against the ship. The writ may"
"be issued against the owner, and the owner may never appear and you get your judgment"
"against the ship without a single person being named from the beginning to end. This is"
"an action in rem, and it is perfectly well understood that the judgment is against the ship.”"
"The primary purpose for the creation of this legal construct is to obtain security"
"for the Plaintiff’s claim, which, if successful, could be enforced by way of judicial sale of"
"the vessel. As Lord Esher in The Cella [1989] 13 PD. 82 held,"
"“The moment that the arrest takes place, the ship is held by the court as security"
"for whatever may be adjudged by it to be due to the claimants”."
"The above is succinctly encapsulated in the following dicta of this Court in the case"
"of Colombo Commercial Fertiliser v. MV “SCI Mumbai”, CA PHC APN 47/2013 decided"
"on 05.05. 2014, by his Lordship A.W.A. Salam J.:"
"“It is a trite concept in Maritime Law that a vessel is considered a wrongdoer for"
"the purpose of a suit. This is a concept that is peculiar only to admiralty law. This legal"
"fiction was created by courts to allow an injured party to proceed in rem directly against"
"the  vessel.  Thus,  even  if  the  owner  of  the  vessel  does  not  participate  in  the  admiralty"
"proceedings, the judgment entered in such proceedings is considered interpartes. One of"
"the objectives of such an innovation is to protect the injured against the empty purse of"
"the charterer by providing redress in the form a lien over the vessel. Thus, the legal fiction"
"of the vessel’s liability saves the embarrassment of the injured party having to circle the"
"globe in his efforts to sue and enjoy the fruits of his victory.”"
"Although the owner of the vessel is not obliged to enter an appearance in an in rem"
"action, a very logical explanation is set out in The Gemma [1895-99] All ER Rep 596 as to"
"why an owner would nevertheless enter an appearance. A.L. Smith L.J. held:"
"“For what purpose does a party appear to an action in rem? There are, as it seems"
"to  me,  three  reasons  for  the appearance:  first to  release  the  ship,  so that  it  may go  on"
