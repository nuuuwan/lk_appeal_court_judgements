"‘Guiseppe di Vittorio’ [1998] C.L.C. 149) Therefore, we hold that a cause of action arose to"
"the  Plaintiff  against  the  Vessel  by  service  provided  to  the  Vessel  at  the  request  of  ST"
"Korea."
"Further, in answering the issues, we must consider who are the ‘relevant persons’ for"
"the purposes of the second limb of the Act in this case."
"The  Owner  strongly  contended  that  there  cannot  be  two  ‘relevant  persons’  under"
"Section 3(4). That is to say, the learned Trial Judge erred in holding that the relevant"
"person in terms of Section 3(4)(b)(i) of the Act (the second limb) was either the Appellant"
"as the ‘beneficial owner’ or Bumyoung Shipping Co. Ltd. as demise charterer. It is their"
"contention, that if the ‘relevant person’ in terms of Section 3(4)(b) (the first limb) was ST"
"Korea Co. Ltd. then ST Korea Co. Ltd must be the ‘relevant person’ for the purposes of"
"Section 3(4)(b)(i) (the second limb) as well. If the Section is interpreted in this way, then"
"ST Korea Co. Ltd would be the ‘relevant person’ in the capacity of demise charterer, as"
"ST Korea Co. Ltd. cannot be treated as the ‘beneficial owner’."
"However,  it is  the  Owner’s  position that  ST Korea  Co.  Ltd  cannot be  treated  as"
"‘demise charterer’ because a demise charter is, on the authorities submitted, one entered"
"into  between  the  shipowner  and  the  charterer,  by  which  the  shipowner  hands  over"
"possession  and  control  of  the  Vessel  to  the  demise  charterer.  In  the  present  case,  it  is"
"undisputed that it was not the Owner of the Vessel but that it was Bumyoung Shipping"
"Co. that chartered the Vessel to ST Korea Co. Therefore, Bumyoung Shipping Co. could"
"not have entered into a Charter by demise with ST Korea Co. Ltd as Bumyoung Shipping"
"Co. is not the Owner of the Vessel. Bumyoung Shipping Co. was merely the charterer by"
"demise."
"It must follow then, if ST Korea Co. Ltd cannot be treated as ‘beneficial owner’ or,"
"for the aforementioned reason, if it cannot be treated as a demise charterer, the Plaintiff"
"cannot institute an in rem action as there will not be any relevant person for the purposes"
"of the second limb of the Section."
"An authoritative definition of the term ‘demise charter’ is found in the judgment"
"of Bridge Oil Ltd. v. Owners and/or Demise Charterers of the Ship ‘Guiseppe di Vittorio’"
"[1998] C.L.C. 149 by Evans L.J.:"
"“What then is a demise charter? Its hallmarks, as it seems to me, are that the legal"
"owner gives the charterer sufficient of the rights of possession and control which enable"
"the transaction to be regarded as a letting — a lease, or demise, in real property terms —"
