"of the ship. Closely allied to this is the fact that the charterer becomes the employer of the"
"master and crew. Both aspects are combined in the common description of a ‘bareboat’"
"lease or hire arrangement.”"
"Further, Scrutton on ‘Charterparties and Bills of Lading’ 19th Edition (at page 47)"
"provides,"
"“A charter by demise operates as a lease of the ship itself, to which the services of"
"the master and crew may or may not be superadded1. The charterer becomes for the time"
"the  owner  of  the  vessel;  the  master  and  crew  become  to  all  intents  his  servants,  and"
"through them the possession of the ship is in him”."
"On a plain reading of the Section, it is evident that Section (3)(4)(b)(i) (the second"
"limb) expressly limits ‘charterer’ to ‘charterer by demise’. This will not then include other"
"charters  such  as  voyage  or  time  charters.  In  contrast,  the  term  ‘charterer’  in  Section"
"(3)(4)(b) (the first limb) can include time, voyage, slot, demise, or any type of charter. This"
"is well established."
