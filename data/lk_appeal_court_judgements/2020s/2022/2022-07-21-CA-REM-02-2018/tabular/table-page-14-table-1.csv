"In  this  case,  the  owners  of  Chem  Orchid,  Han  Kook  Capital  Co  Ltd,  in  its"
"application to set aside the writs contended that at the time the writs had been issued the"
"party who was liable on the claims, that is, the bareboat charterer, Sejin Maritime was"
"no longer the demise charterer of the vessel and as such the requirement of Section 4(4)(1)"
"of the Singapore High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act was not satisfied. The Assistant"
"Registrar struck out the writs in rem on the grounds that the charter had been terminated"
"prior to the issue of the writs. Accordingly, the vessel could not be arrested in relation to"
"claims  arising  in  the  interim  between  the  notice  of  termination  being  given  and  the"
"physical redelivery of the vessel to the shipowners."
"This decision was reversed by Steven Chong J. who held that the charter had not"
"been validly terminated, but even if it had, there was no concept of constructive delivery"
"applicable 
to 
the 
termination  of  bareboat  charters  which  continue  until  physical"
"redelivery as “the complete transfer of possession and control from the ship-owner to the"
"charterer is the very quintessence of a bareboat charter. Thus, physical redelivery (which"
"effects  a  reversion  of  the  transfer  of  possession  and  control) 
is  necessary 
for 
its"
"termination.”"
"Therefore, at the time the in rem writs were issued by the bunker suppliers and"
"the cargo claimants, the vessel was still in the possession of the demise charterers."
"The prime consideration that tilted the balance in favour of requiring physical re-"
"delivery of the vessel for termination was the interests of the third parties involved.  As"
"Steven Chong J. observed:"
"“It is pertinent to stress that third parties who provide services to or load cargo on"
"vessels will often be unaware that the particular vessel is on bareboat charter. Previously,"
"this  placed  them  in  an  acutely  vulnerable  position  because  bareboat  chartered  vessels"
"were insulated from arrest. Following legal reforms in many jurisdictions, this is no longer"
"the case… The consultation paper prepared by the Attorney-General’s Chambers which"
"preceded  the  2004  Amendment  in  Singapore  noted  that,  although  allowing  a  bareboat"
"chartered  vessel  to  be  arrested  might,  at  first  blush,  appear  rather  “startling”  as  it"
"effectively allowed recovery against the shipowner for the liabilities of the charterer, this"
"was  nevertheless  internationally  acceptable  and,  on  the  whole,  desirable  because  “an"
"effective admiralty regime should not cast the burden of determining ownership or other"
"relationship  with  the  vessel  on  the  person  dealing  with  the  vessel”…..The  legislative"
"scheme in Singapore today – as it is the case across many leading maritime jurisdictions"
