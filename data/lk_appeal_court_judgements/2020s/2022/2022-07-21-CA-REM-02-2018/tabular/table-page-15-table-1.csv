"– therefore appears to have struck the balance in favour of third parties who can now deal",""
"with a vessel safe in the knowledge that, regardless of whether the party with whom they",""

"","In my judgment, holding that a valid contractual termination suffices to bring a"
"bareboat  charter  to  an  end","in  the  absence  of  physical  redelivery  may  upset  the"
"aforementioned balance. This is because third parties will find that it is no longer safe to",""
"assume that they have contracted with either the owner or bareboat charterer of a vessel",""
"in all circumstances. If they deal with the vessel after contractual termination but before",""
"redelivery,  it  is  possible  that  they  may  have  in  fact  dealt  with  neither  –  the  owner",""
"certainly  does  not  have  control  and  possession  of  the  vessel  during this  curious  period",""
"where she is in “limbo” whereas the party in full possession and control is no longer the",""
"bareboat charterer following contractual termination. In that event, the third party will",""

"Other cases that subscribe to this school of thought include the following:",""
"","The Australian case of The Turakina [1998] FCA 495, in which, the Turakina was"
"sub-demise chartered by South Pacific Shipping Ltd from Deil Shipowners BV. Deil wrote",""
"to South Pacific stating that the charterparty was terminated with immediate effect. The",""
"charterparty provided that the vessel was to be in the full possession and complete control",""
"of South Pacific during the charter period. It also provided that Deil had, after default in",""
"payment  of  hire,  a  right  to  withdraw  the  vessel  but  that  the  hire  of  the  vessel  was  to",""
"continue until redelivery. Tamberlin J. held,",""
"","“…. there is a significant distinction between a time or voyage charter and a demise"
"charter.   This  distinction  resides  in  the  fact  that  in  a  non-demise  charter  there  is  no",""
"requirement for delivery or transfer of possession to the charterer at the commencement",""
"of the charter.  Accordingly, redelivery cannot require a transfer back of possession. In",""
"such  a  case,  the  services  provided  to  the  charterer  are  terminated  upon  notice  of",""
"withdrawal.  However, in the case of a demise charter the vessel itself is let and possession",""
"is taken by the charterer.  Therefore, once the vessel is withdrawn from the service of the",""
"charterer,  an  obligation  to  redeliver  possession  arises  because  possession  has  been",""
"delivered at the commencement of the charter.  Redelivery, in its natural and ordinary",""
"meaning, denotes a delivery back of that which was originally delivered….",""
