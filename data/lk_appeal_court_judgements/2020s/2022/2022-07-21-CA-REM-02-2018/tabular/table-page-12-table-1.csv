"and that the hire was paid by ST Korea to the Owner and that the letter dated 01st July"
"2013 was sent to both Bumyoung Shipping Co. Ltd and ST Korea Co by the Owner."
"In  the  instant  case,  the  Appellant  did  not  enter  into  a  charterparty  with  the"
"charterer  ST  Korea.  As  mentioned  above,  the Appellant  staunchly  denies  any  dealings"
"with  ST  Korea.  (The  Appellant  even  initially  denied  knowing  that  the  Vessel  was  sub"
"chartered to ST Korea. However, the Appellant changing its stance later admitted that it"
"was aware of the sub charter sometime on or before 14th February 2013- as evidenced by"
"the document marked “D3” on page 305 of the Brief.) Then, if the charter under which ST"
"Korea was operating was not one entered into with the Owner of the Vessel, the charter"
"could  only  have  been  created  by  the  disponent  owner,  which  would  be  Bumyoung"
"Shipping. There is no dispute that it was Bumyoung as demise charterer that chartered"
"the Vessel to ST Korea."
"To succeed in an in rem action there must be a ‘relevant person’  in terms of the"
"first  limb  of  the  Section.  Meaning, the  Plaintiff  must  identify  the  relevant  person  who"
"would be liable in personam when the cause of action arose. (Steps 3 and 4 – supra) This"
"relevant person can be an owner, charterer, or in control or possession, of the vessel.  In"
"the  instant  case,  there  is  no  dispute  that  the  relevant  person  who  would  be  liable  in"
"personam  when  the  cause  of  action  arose  is  ST  Korea  as  the  ‘charterer’  (Because  as"
"mentioned above the word ‘charterer’ in the first limb of Section 3(4) is not exclusive to"
"demise charters and can include any charter)."
