"not 
include  the  right  to  hold  office,  vote,  or  change  the  policies  of  the"
"organization.”"
"In the Indian legislation the words ‘taking part’ had been included to make the"
"Act  applicable  to  a  participant.  In  the  United  States  legislation,  the  words"
"‘participant in the activity’ had been included to make the Act applicable to a"
"participant. In our Act there is no similar inclusion. If the legislature intended to"
"make  the  Act  applicable  to  a  participant  then  similar words could  have  been"
"introduced  in  to  section  16  of  the  Entertainment  Tax  Ordinance  or  without"
"including the words ‘spectator’ or ‘one of an ordinance’ it could have merely"
"stated “admission to any place in which the entertainment is held”."
"In Bennion on Statutory Interpretation 5th Edition at page 1225, it is stated as"
"follows,"
"“A  statutory  term 
is  recognised  by 
its  associated  words.  The  Latin  maxim"
"noscitur a sociis states this contextual principle, whereby a word or phrase is not"
"to be construed as if it stood alone but in the light of its surroundings. While of"
"general application and validity, the maxim has given rise to particular precepts"
"such as the ejusdem generis principle and the rank principle.”"
"At page 1226 it is stated as follows,"
"“This  section  of  the  Code  deals  with  the  manifestations  of  the  principle"
"traditionally subsumed under the rubric noscitur a sociis (it is recognised by its"
"associates). A like principle states that noscitur ex socio, qui non cognoscitur ex"
"se (what cannot be known in itself may be known from its associate). A related"
"maxim is: quae non valeant singula, juncta juvant (what has no meaning by itself"
"is  effective  when  combined).  Francis  Bacon  tells  us  that  copulatio  verborum"
"indicat acceptationem in eodem sensu (the linking of words suggests treatment"
"of them in the same sense). Two detailed applications of the principle are dealt"
"with separately in subsequent provisions of this Code. These are the  ejusdem"
"generis principles and the rank principle."
"A word or phrase in an enactment must always be construed in the light of the"
"surrounding text. ‘... words, and particularly general words, cannot be read in"
"isolation;  their  colour  and  their  content  are  derived 
from  their  context’."
"‘…""facilities"" 
is  ""a  chameleon-like  word""  which  ""takes 
its  colour 
from 
its"
"context"".’"
