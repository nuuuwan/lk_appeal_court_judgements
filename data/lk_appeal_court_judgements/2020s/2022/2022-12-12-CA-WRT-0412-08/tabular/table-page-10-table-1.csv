"The Entertainment Tax Ordinance is a taxing ordinance. Therefore, the intention"
"to impose a tax on the participants of an amusement must be shown by clear"
"and unambiguous language and cannot be inferred by ambiguous words. On the"
"plain reading of section 16 of the Ordinance it is apparent that such an intention"
"is  not  shown  by  clear  and  unambiguous 
language.  Therefore,  one  cannot"
"interpret  the  section  to  include  a  participant  of  an  amusement  within  the"
"meaning of ‘admission’ in section 16 of the Ordinance to enable the Act to apply"
"in such a situation."
"For the aforesaid reasons we are of the view that the certificate issued by the 1st"
"Respondent marked P16 certifying that a sum of Rs. 17,885,000.00 is due to the"
"3rd Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha from the Petitioner is unlawful, ultra vires and"
"contrary to the provisions of the Entertainment Tax Ordinance No. 12 of 1946"
"(as amended)."
"The Petitioner is also seeking for a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari"
"quashing the approval of the 2nd Respondent and the notification marked P11b"
"published 
in  the  Government  Gazette.  By  that  Gazette  notification  the  2nd"
"Respondent had approved the 3rd Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha to impose an"
"Entertainment Tax of 25% on the admission charges of all the entertainments"
"within  the  Pradeshiya  Sabha  division.  That  applies  to  all  the  entertainments"
"performed  within  the  Pradeshiya  Sabha  area.  The  question  whether 
it 
is"
"reasonable to impose an Entertainment Tax of 25% on the admission charges of"
"a  particular  entertainment  will  depend  on 
the  nature  of  a  particular"
"entertainment and vary from one type of an entertainment to the other. If we"
"issue  a  writ  of  Certiorari  quashing  that  approval  that  will  prevent  the  3rd"
"Respondent  Pradeshiya  Sabha  from  recovering  an  entertainment  tax  from  all"
"the other persons who performed entertainments within the Pradeshiya Sabha"
"area who are not before this Court. Therefore, we are of the view that this Court"
"should not issue such a mandate."
"Reasonableness of charging 25% of the admission charges as an Entertainment"
"Tax"
"The 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for 
the  Petitioner 
submitted 
that 
it 
is"
"unreasonable to charge 25% of the admission charges of the Petitioner as an"
"Entertainment Tax. He submitted that the Petitioner already pays 15% of its turn"
"over  as  Value  Added  Tax  (VAT).  After  the  5year  Tax  concession  period  the"
"Petitioner is liable to pay income tax at the rate of 35% of its profits. Therefore,"
"it was the submission of the learned President’s Counsel that if in addition to"
"VAT and Income Tax, the Petitioner were to pay an Entertainment Tax of 25% of"
"its turn over that would cripple the Petitioner’s business. As we have come to"
