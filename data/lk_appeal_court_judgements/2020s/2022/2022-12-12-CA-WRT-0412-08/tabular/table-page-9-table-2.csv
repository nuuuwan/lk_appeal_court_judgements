"In the case of Vallibel Lanka Pvt Ltd Vs. Director General of Customs and others"
"(2008) BLR page 47 Siripavan J. (as he then was) held (with S. N. Silva PC CJ. and"
"Amarathunga J. agreeing) as follows,"
"1.  It is the established rule in the interpretation of statues levying taxes and"
"duties not to extend the provisions of the statute by implication, beyond"
"the  clear  import  of  the  language  used  or  to  enlarge  their  operation  in"
"order to embrace matters not specifically pointed out. In case of doubt,"
"the provisions are construed most strongly against the state and in favour"
"of the citizen."
"2.  Thus, the intention to impose duties and/or taxes on imported goods must"
"be shown by clear and unambiguous words."
"3.  Considerations of hardship, injustice or anomalies do not play any useful"
"role in construing fiscal statutes. One must have regard to the strict letter"
"of the law and cannot import provisions in the Customs Ordinance so as to"
"supply any assumed deficiency."
