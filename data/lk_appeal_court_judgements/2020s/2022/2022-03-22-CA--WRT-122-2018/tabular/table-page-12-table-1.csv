"written submission has caused a material disadvantage to him.  We find that all contentions that"
"had been summarized in the written submission, elicited at the inquiry, had been considered by"
"the Arbitrator. We find that the Arbitrator has properly evaluated and considered the evidence"
"and material that had been led before him. We do not see any irrationality or illegality in the"
"Arbitrator’s award."
"Even though the Petitioner had pleaded that the impugned award is arbitrary and ultra-vires, the"
"Petitioner has failed to demonstrate those grounds before the Court.  In this instance, this Court is"
"exercising very limited jurisdictions as this is not an appeal. When a decision is challenged by"
"way of certiorari, the role of the Court in such an instance was elaborated in;"
"Kalamazoo Industries Ltd and Others vs. Minister of Labour & Vocational Training and"
"Others. (1998 1SLR 235)  where it was stated  “Relief by way of certiorari in relation to an"
"award made by an arbitrator will be forthcoming to quash such an award only if the arbitrator"
"wholly or in part assumes a jurisdiction which he does not have or exceeds that which he has"
"or acts contrary to principals of natural justice or pronounces an award which is eminently"
"irrational or unreasonable or is guilty of illegality. The remedy by way of certiorari cannot be"
"made use of to correct errors or to substitute a correct order for a wrong order and if the"
"arbitrator’s   award   was   not   set   aside   in   whole   or   in   part,   it   had   to   be   allowed   to   stand"
"unreversed. It is pertinent to refer to the principles laid down by Prof. H. W R. Wade on"
"“Administrative Law” 12th edition at pages 34 to 35 wherein the learned author states ‘Judicial"
"review is radically different from the system of appeals. When hearing an appeal, the Court is"
"concerned by  the merits  of the decision  under  appeal  but  in  judicial  review,  the Court is"
"concerned with its legality. On appeal, the question is right or wrong. On review, the question"
"is lawful or unlawful….”."
"Therefore, after considering all the grounds that had been argued by Counsel, we find that the"
"Petitioner has failed to demonstrate any illegality in the impugned award. Accordingly for the"
"reasons   set   out   in   the   judgment   we   are   not   inclined   to   grant   the   relief   prayed.   Thus,   this"
"application is dismissed without cost."
