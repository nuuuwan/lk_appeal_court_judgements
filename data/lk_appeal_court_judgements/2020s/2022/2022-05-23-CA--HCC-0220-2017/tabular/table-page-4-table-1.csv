"According to the evidence of PW-01 Kandasami Dewadas, who was also the"
"injured in the incident, while the consuming of liquor was going on, he has"
"suddenly seen the appellant attacking the deceased Samantha who was also"
"seated with them using what he thought was a club. In order to prevent the"
"attack, he has put his hand in between and received a cut injury as a result."
"He has realized that it was not a club only because of the cut injury he has"
"received.  He  has  seen  the  deceased  being  attacked  several  times  by  the"
"appellant. He was clear in his evidence that prior to the attack there was no"
"previous  quarrel  between  them  and  they  were  singing  and  enjoying  the"
"moment and the appellant was standing and the deceased was seated."
"The evidence of all the other eyewitnesses was on the same line which clearly"
"suggests that there was no previous provocation and the incident was a result"
"of an unexplained sudden fight. It appears from the line of defence taken by"
"the Counsel who represented the appellant at the High Court trial was that"
"there was a fight between all of the persons who were present over the liquor"
"they consumed, and this incident occurred as a result."
"He  has  not  put  forward  a  defence  based  on  a  sudden  fight  between  the"
"appellant and the deceased. Which may be the reason why the Counsel who"
"represented the appellant at the trial decided to withdraw from the case when"
"the appellant gave evidence under oath in his defence."
"The  appellant  giving  evidence  has  admitted  that  it  was  he  who  caused  the"
"injuries  to  the  deceased.  He  has  reasoned  out  by  saying  while  they  were"
"consuming liquor and having a party at the ground, there was a fight over a"
"liquor bottle and as a result the deceased tried to attack him and he got hold"
"of what he was being attacked and hit the deceased twice and ran away from"
"the scene."
"It appears that his position before the learned Counsel who appeared for him"
"withdrew from the case had been that it was somebody else who had attacked"
"the deceased. It is therefore clear that the appellant has taken different stands"
