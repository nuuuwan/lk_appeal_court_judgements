"money  cannot  be  permitted,  especially  now,  at  a  time  when  Sri  Lanka  is  faced  with  a"
"severe  economic  crisis.  The  negative  impact  on  vital  sectors  due  to  a  lack  of  foreign"
"currency and the loss of government tax income due to informal transactions will only add"
"to the woes of the country."
"The Tax Appeals Commission, in its determination, made a pertinent observation"
"that, “As Colandiam (Pvt.) Ltd. is the final exporter…. it enjoys the zero rating facility"
"and therefore, it is to be noted that zero rating facility cannot be granted in respect of two"
"registered suppliers in respect of the same export.”"
"This  raises  the  question,  for  which  there  is  no  material  before  this  Court  to"
"determine, whether Colandiam has claimed the entire benefit of zero-rating? Or whether"
"Colandiam has claimed the benefit only for the services it supplied in regard to polishing"
"diamonds? If the Appellant is entitled to zero-rating, in the absence of this information,"
"that would give rise to unjust enrichment or a windfall in respect of the savings made"
"from zero-rating."
"The burden of proof is on the Appellant, seeking the benefit of zero-rating in terms"
"of Section 7(1)(c) of the VAT Act, to satisfy this Court that it comes within the parameters"
"of this Section. Clear proof must be adduced by the Assessee to avail the benefit of a tax"
"exemption as the facts and figures are known to the Assessee."
"This  position  is  buttressed  by  Section  103  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  which"
"stipulates that the burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wants"
"the court to believe in its existence."
"In the recent case of Peoples’ Leasing and Finance PLC v. Commissioner General"
"of Inland Revenue, CA TAX 0021/2019 decided on 20.07.2021, his Lordship Dr. Ruwan"
"Fernando J. held,"
"“It is to be noted that the burden of proving that an assessment is excessive or"
"erroneous is on the assessee who is objecting to the assessment and, thus, if the person"
"assessed fails to prove that the assessment is excessive or wrong, the assessment will be"
"affirmed in appeal”"
