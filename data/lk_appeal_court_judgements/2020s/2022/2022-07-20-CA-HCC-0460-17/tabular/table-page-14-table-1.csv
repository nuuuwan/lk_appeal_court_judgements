"ලද  පරිවේශනිය  සාක්ිෙලින්  එ ඹිය  හැකි  එකම  අනුමිතිය  විත්තිකරුවේ  නිවදෝර්ීභාෙය  සමග"

"This amply provides that the learned High Court Judge was well possessed of"
"the  way  circumstantial  evidence  should  be  analyzed  in  order  to  determine"
"whether the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt against"
"the appellant."
"I am in total agreement with the learned DSG that the omission pointed out in"
"the evidence of PW-03 and the contradiction marked V-02 are not material that"
"goes into the root of the prosecution case. As I have stated earlier, what needs to"
"be looked at is the totality of the evidence. Apart from PW-03, PW-02 also has"
"seen the appellant running away with a weapon in his hand. Soon thereafter,"
"PW-18 has seen him getting into a three-wheeler and leaving the scene of the"
"crime. When he was arrested, he had attempted to commit suicide by consuming"
"cyanide, but the prompt actions of PW-09 have prevented his attempt."
"In the contradiction marked V-01, P-02 has stated in his police statement that"
"he  saw  the  appellant  fleeing  in  a  green-coloured  three-wheeler,  but  in  his"
"evidence before the Court it has been stated that he only saw the appellant going"
"out from the gate. This can be very well attributed to the fact that he has given"
"evidence some nine years after the actual event and he was no longer a serving"
"police officer at that time. Be that as it may, the evidence of other witnesses has"
"provided  that  in  fact  it  was  in  a  green-coloured  three-wheeler  the  person  who"
"came running out of the police station fled, which makes the contradiction of no"
"material value."
"It is settled law that a witness who gives evidence long after the incident is not"
"expected to have a photographic memory as to the sequence of events that took"
"place within a short span of time like in the given incident."
"At this stage it is appropriate to refer to the Indian case of Bhoginbhai Hitijibhai"
"Vs.  State  of  Gujarat  (AIR  1983-SC  753  at  pp  756-758)  often  cited  in  our"
"Courts. It was held:"
