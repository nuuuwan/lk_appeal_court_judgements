"clear that what the learned High Court Judge has stated was in reference to the"
"evidence of the JMO and what was stated in the postmortem report. As I have"
"highlighted before, the JMO has explained what he meant by the word ‘rifle type’"
"due to the entry and the exit wounds observed by him and has commented that"
"the  weapon  can  also  be  either  a  revolver  or  a  pistol.  The  learned  High  Court"
"Judge has well considered the evidence of the Government Analyst who was a"
"well-recognized expert on ballistics, and the evidence led in relation the recovery"
"of the weapon in terms of a section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance to come to"
"a firm finding that it was the macro pistol marked P-01 that has been used in"
"committing the crime."
"It  is  correct  to  argue  that  the  discovery  of  an  item  on  a  statement  made  to  a"
"police officer by a suspect can only lead to the inference of the knowledge of the"
"maker of the statement to the item or items found. However, when considering"
"the evidence as a whole, it is clear that if not for the direction by the appellant"
"the  pistol  marked  P-01  would  not  have  been  recovered  from  the  place  it  was"
"recovered."
"I find that even if the evidence in relation to the finding of an index fingerprint of"
"the  appellant  on  a mirror  found  near  the  scene  of  the  crime  is  disregarded  in"
"view of the undisputed fact the appellant had been a frequent visitor to IP Thabru"
"and there is a possibility of having a fingerprint of the appellant in the normal"
"course of events, it had not dented the case of the prosecution. In this action,"
"the other evidence placed before the Court has provided overwhelming evidence"
"in support of the prosecution case."
"I am unable to agree with the contention that the learned High Court Judge has"
"failed to properly evaluate the dock statement of the appellant. I find that the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  has  given  due  value  to  the  dock  statement  of  the"
"appellant considering the fact that it was not evidence given under oath and not"
"subjected to the test of cross-examination."
