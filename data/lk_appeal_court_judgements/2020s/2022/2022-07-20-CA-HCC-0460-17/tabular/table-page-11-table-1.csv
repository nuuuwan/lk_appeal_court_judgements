"shooting took place, was also an admitted fact. It was his view that the omission"
"and the contradiction relied on by the appellant are not material enough to create"
"a doubt in the prosecution case which was based on circumstantial and scientific"
"evidence."
"It was submitted that the evidence of PW-02 and PW-03 has been corroborated"
"by PW-18 who saw the person who came out of the police station, getting into a"
"three-wheeler  and  fleeing,  whose  evidence  remain  unchallenged.  It  was  the"
"position  of  the 
learned  DSG  that  when  PW-09  pursued  and  arrested  the"
"appellant  at  the  Army  roadblock,  the  appellant  has  attempted  to  consume"
"cyanide,  which  goes  on  to  show  that  the  stand  of  the  appellant  that  he  was"
"arrested near the gate of the police station has no basis in view of the evidence"
"to  the  contrary.  Commenting  that  the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has  not"
"determined the matter on the basis that the injuries caused to the deceased have"
"been  caused  using  a  rifle,  it  was  the  position  of  the  learned  DSG  that  the"
"determination  was  that  it  was  the  pistol  marked  P-01  that  has  been  used  to"
"commit the crime."
"Making  his  submissions  as  to  the  evidence  adduced  at  the  trial,  it  was  the"
"position of the learned DSG that the appeal has no merit."
