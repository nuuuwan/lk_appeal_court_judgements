"his hand. When seen he was about 20 feet away from him. He has then seen IP"
"Thabru with injuries and had seen the appellant running out of the station from"
"the  second  gate.  According  to  the  evidence  of  the  witness,  he  has  known  the"
"appellant previously as a person who used to visit IP Thabru frequently. He too"
"had identified the appellant at the subsequent identification parade held. Both"
"the witnesses have identified the production marked P-01 as a one similar to the"
"weapon carried by the appellant when they saw him. It was his evidence that"
"although he was not able to see the appellant face to face while running away,"
"but by his left-hand side, he was able to identify him. Under cross examination,"
"the witness has stated that he saw the appellant getting into a three-wheeler and"
"fleeing the scene."
"It  needs  to  be  noted  that  PW-02  who  has  commenced  his  evidence  on  01-03-"
"2012 has only concluded his evidence on 03-03-2016. His evidence has been led"
"before  several  High  Court  Judges,  which  has  led  to  the  repetition  of  evidence"
"several times over, may it under cross examination or in the evidence-in-chief,"
"which I do not find as a healthy practice to follow in any trial. The PW-03 who"
"was the first witness called by the prosecution and concluded her evidence on"
"14-02-2012, has been recalled to face cross examination again on an application"
"by the defence. I am unable to find any material differences in the evidence of"
"the PW-03 in her evidence taken before the Court for the second time."
"The  Judicial  Medical  Officer  (JMO)  who  conducted  the  postmortem  as  to  the"
"death of the deceased has confirmed that the death of the deceased was due to"
"injuries to his head inflicted from a close range. Describing the possible weapon"
"used, he has commented the following;"
"රයිෆල්  වෙපන්  එක  ස්ොමීනී  එහි  ඇතුල්වෙන තුොලය  වසන්ිමීටර්  එකක  විෂ්කම්බයක්  තිබුණා.  එක"
"තුොලයයි තිබුවේ ඇතුව ්. ඒ ඇතුව ්දී අදා  යකඩ කෑල්ල මට හමුවුවේ. එවහම බලනවකාට එෙැනි"
"වේෙල්  සිදුවෙන්වන්  රයිෆල්  වෙපන්  එකකින්.  ඒ  කියන්වන්  එක  බුලට්  එකක්  පිටවෙලා  තිවයන්වන්."
"නමුත් ඒ වෙපන් එවකන් අවනක් පැත්තට යකඩ කෑල්ල ගිහිල්ල නැහැ. ඒ කියන්වන් රයිෆල් වෙපන්ෙල"
