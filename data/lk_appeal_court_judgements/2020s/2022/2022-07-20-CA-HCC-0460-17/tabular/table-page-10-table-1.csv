"Court, his statement to police has been that he saw the appellant fleeing in a"
"green-coloured three-wheeler. (The contradiction marked V-01). It was his view"
"that  this  contradiction  casts  a  shadow  over  his  evidence  as  to  whether  he"
"actually  saw  the  appellant  in  the  manner  he  claims,  which  should  have  been"
