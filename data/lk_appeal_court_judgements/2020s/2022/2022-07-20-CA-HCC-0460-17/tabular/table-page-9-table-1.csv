"The Grounds of Appeal"
"At  the  hearing  of  the  appeal,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  raised  the"
"following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court."
"(1) The  items  of  circumstantial  evidence  adduced  at  the  trial  are  not"
"sufficient to find the appellant guilty."
"(2) The identification of the appellant by the witnesses is not credible."
"(3) The evidence of PW-02 and PW-03 are not credible and trustworthy."
"(4) The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  not  properly  evaluated  the  dock"

"appellant  running  away  with  a  small  pistol  like  weapon  in  his  hand,  she  has"
"failed  to  say  that  to  the  police  when  she  gave  her  statement,  which  had  been"
"drawn to the attention of the Court at the trial as an omission. It was his view"
"that her evidence should have been rejected on that material omission alone."
"It  was  also  his  position  that  although  the  PW-02  has  stated  that  he  saw  the"
