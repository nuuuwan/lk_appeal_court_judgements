"“Now, losses can be of various kinds; but the matter for consideration in this kind of"
"case  is  the  financial  loss,  and  not  sentimental  harm  caused  by  the  employer.  In  his"
"petition to this Court, dated 25, September1990, the Petitioner refers to the fact that he"
"was “undergoing hardships, both financially and mentally…”"
"In terms of section 17 (1) of the Act, an Arbitrator could make an award which appears"
"to him ‘just and equitable’. In the case of United Engineering Worker’s Union Vs K.W."
"Devanayagan3 Court opined that the award of an arbitrator has to be one which appeals"
"to the arbitrator ‘just and equitable’ and they are given an unfettered discretion to do"
"what they think is right and fair. What is meant by ‘just and equitable’ was discussed"
"in the case of Peris Vs Podisinhgo4. It was held that the test of ‘just and equitable’ order"
"is that those equalities would be apparent to any ‘fair-minded person’ reading the order"
"(at page 48). Nevertheless, the order should be within the framework of law (Richard"
"Pieris & Co.  Ltd Vs.  Wijesiriwardena5). The powers and duties of an arbitrator under"
"the Act and of a labor tribunal in a reference of an industrial dispute are the same. In"
"Arnolda Vs Gopalan6 it was held that the Labour Tribunal derives its jurisdiction from"
"the  Industrial  Disputes  Act.  The  powers  of  the  Labour  Tribunal  to  make  a  just  and"
"equitable  order  has 
to  be 
looked  at  within 
the  four  corners  of 
the  Act  and 
its"
"amendments. In the instant application, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner"
"does not submit that the findings of the 1st Respondent that damages have been caused"
"to 
the  7th  added  Respondent’s 
furniture 
is  against 
the  evidence  before 
the  1st"
"Respondent. In addition to that there is evidence that the 7th added Respondent has been"
"ejected by the Petitioner. Therefore, an Order to pay compensation for ejectment and"
"for  the  damages  caused  to  the  7th  added  Respondent’s  furniture  is  within  the  four"
"corners of law and not violating the provisions of section 17(1) of the Act. It would be"
"apparent to any fair-minded person that making an award for the ejectment and damages"
"caused to the furniture is ‘just and equitable’. Under the above stated circumstances,"
"the award of the 1st Respondent in view of the ejectment and damages caused to the"
"furniture could be considered as legal and should be allowed to stand. Therefore, the"
"Petitioner 
is  not  entitled  writs  as  prayed 
for 
in 
the  Petition  dated  09.07.2019."
