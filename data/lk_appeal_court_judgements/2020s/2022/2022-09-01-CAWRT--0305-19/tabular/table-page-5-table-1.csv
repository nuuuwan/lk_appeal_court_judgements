"substitute a correct order for a wrong order. Judicial review is radically different from"
"appeals. When hearing an appeal, the Court is concerned with the merits of the decision"
"under appeal. In judicial review, the court is concerned with its legality. On appeal the"
"question is right or wrong. On review, the question is whether the act or order is lawful"
