"This Court is mindful of the fact that the aforesaid central question that"
"arises 
for  determination  before 
this  Court  was  not  adjudicated  and"
"determined by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court in their Orders"
"marked X4, X20, X23 and 1R4. Besides, the said Orders of Apex Courts"
"are  not 
impediments 
for 
the  Petitioner 
to  proceed  with 
the 
instant"
"application.  Hence,  I  decline  to  accept  the  submission  of  the  learned"
"President’s  Counsel  for  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  that  the  dispute  in"
"suit  has  already  been  adjudicated  by 
the  apex  Courts  against 
the"
"Petitioner."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents,  in  the"
"written submissions, has disputed the title of the said K.G. Somapala on"
"the basis that he had purchased the subject matter over the head of the"
"tenant.  This  fact  is  not  relevant  to  the  question  in  dispute  and  to  the"
"forgoing central question that arises for determination in this application."
"For these reasons, I issue writs of Certiorari to quash  the vesting Order"
"bearing No. 2116 dated 22-03-2019 marked X28 and the recommendation"
"of  the  Commissioner  of  National  Housing  marked  X24.  I  issue  a  writ  of"
"Mandamus  on  the  Commissioner  preventing  him  from  transferring  the"
"subject matter to the 1st and 2nd Respondents."
"I make no Order as to costs."
"Application allowed."
