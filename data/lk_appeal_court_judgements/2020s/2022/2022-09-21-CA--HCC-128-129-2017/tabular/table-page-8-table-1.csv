"The  identification  of  an assailant  and  connecting  him  with  the  crime  after  a  fair  trial  is  an"
"integral  element  of  a  criminal  trial.  E.R.S.R  Coomaraswamy  in  his  work  “Law  of  Evidence”"
"quoted both R Vs Orton and Wills regarding the issue of identification as follows:"
"""A  party's  identity  with  an  ascertained  person  may  arise  both  in  civil  and  criminal"
"cases. The question of identity is particularly important in criminal cases. Identity may"
"be proved or disproved by direct testimony or opinion evidence or presumptively by"
"circumstantial  evidence.  Criminal  law  insists  on  proper  identification.  Cases  have"
"shown that what is supposed to be the clearest intimation of the sense, is sometimes"
"fallacious and defective"""
"Whereas in R Vs Turnbull (1977) Q.B. 224, the court held as follows:"
"“Whenever  the  case  of  an  accused  person  depends  wholly  or  substantially  on  the"
"correctness of one or more identifications of the accused which the defence alleges"
"to be mistaken, the Judge should warn the jury of the special need for caution before"
"convicting in reliance on the correctness of the identification.”"
"“He  should  instruct  them  as  the  reason  for  that  warning  and  should  make  some"
"reference to the possibility that a mistake. Witness could be a convincing one and that"
"several witnesses could all be mistaken.”"
