"The  appellant  had  made  an  application  to  discharge  him  but  the  Magistrate"
"had  refused  and  the  same  had  been  made  to  the  High  Court  but  the  High"
"Court also had refused."
"The  respondents  averred  that  the  Magistrate  had  ample  ground  to  add  the"
"appellant as an accused based on the statement of the watcher of the land in"
"question  and  the  statement  of  the  Notary  who  had  executed  the  deeds"
"pertaining to the land in issue."
"If one may go through the two statements referred to by the respondents the"
"watcher had stated that the appellant had told him that he has sold the land"
"to the 1st accused in the Magistrate Court and to facilitate him in dealing with"
"the prospective buyers, and he had seen some people giving money to the 1st"
"accused but he makes no other reference to the appellant."
"The Notary who had executed some of the deeds pertaining to the sale of the"
"land  had  said  that  the  appellant  signed  the  deeds  as  he  held  the  power  of"
"attorney but the fees of the Notary had been paid by the 1st accused."
"Therefore  the  material  furnished  before  the  Magistrate  only  reveals  facts"
"which  the  appellant  has  also  stated  before  this  Court.  But,  the  Magistrate"
"based  on  these  two  statements  has  proceeded  to  instruct  the  police  to  add"
"the appellant as an accused in the matter. This action of the Magistrate, this"
"Court notes with surprise because the above mentioned two statements does"
"not reveal any material constituting an offence. The most Magistrate should"
"have done in the opinion of this Court is to direct the police to investigate the"
"matter further and seek the advice of the Attorney General. This Court notes"
"with displeasure that the Magistrate had proceeded to instruct the police to"
"add the appellant as an accused even without recording a statement of his."
