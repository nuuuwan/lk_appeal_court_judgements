"insufficient 
to  determine 
the 
issue  before  us.  The 
issue  before  us 
is  not"
"whether or not the income or profit generated from one source of income can"
"be characterized “in the nature of trade or business”. The first issue before use"
"is whether or not, when the business consists in the category of several profits"
"or  income,  it  is  a  part  and  parcel  of  the  main  business  generated  from  the"
"source of  income  stipulated  in  section  3(1)(a). The  second  issue before  us  is"
"whether or not, when the business consists in the category of several profits or"
"income, it is a separate category of income generated from “any other source"
"of income” stipulated in section 3(1)(j) of the Inland Revenue Act."
"[40] The Appellant heavily relied on the decision of the Delhi High Court case"
"in  Commissioner  of  Income  Tax  v.  FX  Info  Technologies  (Pvt)  Ltd  ITA  No."
"112/2011  &113/2011to  buttress 
its  argument 
that 
the  profits  and 
income"
"claimed by it falls within the meaning of section 3(1) (a) of the Act. The facts of"
"the said case reveal that the assessee company was carrying on the business"
"of  distribution  of  Acer  products  of  M/s.  Acer  India  Pvt.  Ltd.  The  assesse"
"decided,  due  to  financial  constraints  to  transfer  the  distribution  of  the  Acer"
"products to M/s. Salora International Ltd. (for short ""SIL""), for which M/s. Acer"
"India Pvt. Ltd., had also consented, by virtue of a written agreement between"
"the assessee and SIL. The distribution of the products was to be taken over by"
"SIL on certain terms and conditions including payment of commission on sale"
"at the rate of one per cent."
"[41]  The  assessee  made  profits  of 
the  same  business,  by  virtue  of 
the"
"commission received from SIL. The assessee offered the commission income"
"gained  from  its  business  as  ""business  income""  and  set  off  the  same  against"
"the business losses incurred in the same business. The Assessor treated the"
"income  of 
the  assessee 
from 
the  commission  as 
from  other 
“income"
"sources” and declined to set off against the brought forward business losses"
"on 
the  basis 
that 
the  commission 
income  so 
received  by 
the  appellant-"
"company from SIL is not a business income."
"[42]  The  Commissioner  of  Income-Tax  (Appeals)  held  that  the  commission"
"amount 
to  be  a  business 
income  and 
the  assessee  was  entitled 
to  an"
"assessment  of  the  carried  forward  business  losses.  The  Tax  Tribunal  upheld"
"the order of the Commissioner of Income-Tax (Appeals) and accepted that the"
"commission paid by SIL to the assessee was business expenditure, and such"
"business  expenditure  in  the  hands  of  SIL  by  natural  corollary  is  the  business"
"income in the hands of the assessee."
"[43]  The  High  Court  confirmed  the  decision  of  the  tribunal  and  dismissed  the"
"appeal. It stated in paragraph 5 of the decision as follows:"
