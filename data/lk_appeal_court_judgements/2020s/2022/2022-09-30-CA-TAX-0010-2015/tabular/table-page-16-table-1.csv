"[47] Having applied the above-mentioned tests, Soertsz, J., held inter alia, that"
"(i) the amount in question is “profits and income” derived from the business of"
"an agricultural undertaking, and is therefore assessable under section 6 (1) (a);"
"(ii) if it does not fall within the scope of section 6 (1) (a), it is caught up by the"
"“residuary” subsection 6 (1) (h) as this is not something casual or something in"
"the nature of a windfall (p. 190)."
"[48]  No  doubt,  these  elements  provide  adequate  tests  by  which  to  ascertain"
"whether a particular receipt is “income” receipt or “capital receipt”, and if it is a"
"capital receipt, whether it attracts section 3(1) (a) and if it is an income receipt"
"from any other source, it attracts section 3(1) (j). There is no question that the"
"commission fee is a gain that has actually reached the hands of the Appellant"
"in  the  form  of  income.  However,  the  question  is  whether  or  not,  when  the"
"income  is  generated  from  several  categories  of  sources  as  it  is  here,  it  falls"
"within  the  meaning  of  section  3(1)(a)  or  under  “any  other  source  of  income”"
"stipulated in section 3(1)(j) of the Inland Revenue Act."
"[49]  The  Appellant  relied  on  the  five-bench  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in"
"Ceylon Financial Investments Limited V. Commissioner of Income Tax 1 CTC"
"206/43  NLR  1  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  ‘CFI  judgment’)  in  support  of  its"
"contention  that  as  the  income  received  from  sources  under  section  3  are"
"mutually  exclusive  and  cannot  be  interchanged,  the  income  received  from"
"commission/purchases  by  its  nature  falls  into  section  3(1)(a),  which  excludes"
"the application of section 3(1) (j) of the Act. The Appellant however, quoted the"
"following  passage  from  the  judgment  of  Howard,  C.J.  at  p.  250  of  the  said"
"case, completely disregarding the crucial tests laid down by the judges in that"
"case  to  determine  whether  the  interest  and  dividends  can  be  regarded  as  a"
"source  either  under  section  6(1)(a)  or  6(1)(e)  of  the  Income  Tax  Ordinance,"
"1932."
