"[8] On the first and second questions of law, the TAC held that",""
"a)  The  sale 
transaction  between 
the  Appellant  and","the  Lanka  Walltile"
"","Meepe  Ltd  was  a  local  sale  transaction,  which  entitled  the  Appellant  to"
"","receive a 5% commission on such entire purchases, whether in fact part"
"","of such sales were exports or not, and the commission income received"
"","by  the  Appellant  comes  under  the  income  from  “any  other  source”  as"
"stipulated in the section 3(j) of the Inland Revenue Act;",""
"","b)  As the Appellant claimed that the commission earned is a part and parcel"
"","of  its  regular  business  income  and  therefore,  falls  within  the  ambit  of"
"","section  3(1)(a)  of  the  Act,  a  duty  is  imposed  by  section  106  (11)  of  the"
"","Inland Revenue Act on the Appellant who carries on more than one trade"
"","or business, to maintain and prepare statements of accounts in a manner"
"that the profits or income from each activity may be separately identified;",""
"c)  No  separate  accounts  had  been  maintained  and  provided  by","the"
"","Appellant  as  required by  section  106  (11) of  the  Inland  Revenue Act  to"
"","identify the income from commission as a part of the business income of"
"the Appellant under section 3(1)(a) of the IRA 2006.",""
"[9]  On 
the 
third  question  raised  before 
the  TAC, 
it  determined 
that","the"
"","discrepancy  was  a  result  of  a  mistake,  that  had  in  fact  occurred  by  Lanka"
"Ceramics PLC,  and  therefore,  there  was  no  understatement  of  the  turnover",""
"","by the Appellant. Accordingly, the TAC by its determination dated 16.12.2014"
"","confirmed  the  determination  made  by  the  Commissioner  General  of  Inland"
"Revenue and dismissed the Appeal.",""
