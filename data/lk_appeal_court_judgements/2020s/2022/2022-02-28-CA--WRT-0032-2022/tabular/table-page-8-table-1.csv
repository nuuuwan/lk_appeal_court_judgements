"On a careful consideration of the whole matter and in light of the reasoning given in my above"
"orders (CA/Writ/649/2021, CA/Writ/12/2022 and CA/Writ/31/2022) and in view of the"
"legal analysis established in the cases bearing Nos. CA Writ/24/2021, CA/Writ/51/2021,"
"CA/Writ/57/2021 and CA/Writ/61/2021, I take the view that the 1st Respondent Governor"
"has  given  due  effect  to  the  provisions  of  sections  14,  168  and  169  of  the  Act  and  lawfully"
"decided that the Petitioner has deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman."
"In the circumstances, I am of the view that the questions raised by the Petitioner in the instant"
"application have already been resolved in the above orders of this Court. Therefore, based on"
"the arguability principles that should be adopted in respect of matters relating to issuance of"
"notice in a juridical review application, I arrive at the conclusion that there is no arguable case"
"or  a  prima  facie  case  for  this  Court  to  issue  formal  notice  on  the  Respondents  in  this"
"application. Therefore, I refuse this application."
