"decision solely to see whether or not there was a manifest error and/or whether the process"
"was in some way unfair;"
"“Under the 2006 Regulations as amended, the principal way in which an unsuccessful bidder,"
"such as the claimants, can challenge the proposed award of a contract to another bidder is to"
"show that the public body's evaluation of the rival bids either involved a manifest error or was"
"in some way unfair or arose out of unequal treatment. Accordingly, in deciding such claims,"
"the court's function is a limited one. It is reviewing the decision solely to see whether or not"
"there was a manifest error and/or whether the process was in some way unfair. The court is"
"not  undertaking  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  tender  evaluation  process;  neither  is  it"
"substituting its own view as to the merits or otherwise of the rival bids for that already reached"
"by the public body.”"
