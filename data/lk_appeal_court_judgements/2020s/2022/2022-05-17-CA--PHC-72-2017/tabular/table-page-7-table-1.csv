"A
 certificate can be issued under Section 38 (2) of the said Act only where an employer defaults"
"in the payment of any sum which he is liable to pay under the Act. The issue of a certificate does"
"not compel the Magistrate’s Court to proceed automatically to recover the sum stated. The Court"
"must first give the alleged defaulter an opportunity to show cause, why further proceedings for the"
"recovery of sum claimed  should not  be taken. The Law thus  expressly incorporates the rule of"
"“Audi alteram partem”. Fairness requires that when a certificate mentions a sum allegedly due, it"
"must also give adequate  details of how it was made up to enable the  alleged defaulter to show"
"cause."
