"Therefore, it is  clear that the land had not been surveyed  previously  and the"
"extent mentioned in the deed is a rough calculation. Therefore, a discrepancy in"
"the extent like this can arise."
"The land described in the Plaint can be identified by its metes and bounds and"
"physical demarcations. The boundaries shown in the plan marked පැ1 tally with"
"the  boundaries  described  in  the  schedule  to  the  Plaint  and  the  boundaries"
"mentioned in deed පැ2. All four boundaries tally. According to the schedule to"
"the Plaint and the schedules of the deeds, the western boundary of the land is"
"the other portion of the same land. Although the land shown in plan  පැ1 is a"
"portion of a larger land, the deed marked පැ2 had been executed to that portion"
"in 1926 as a separate land and the subsequent deed also had been executed on"
"the same basis. Those deeds were registered and therefore, it can be presumed"
"that the land shown by the Plaintiffs was registered as a separate land. I have"
"come to the conclusion elsewhere in the judgment that the Plaintiffs and their"
"predecessors in title had been in possession of the corpus. That means the deeds"
"produced by the Plaintiff (පැ2 and පැ3) had been acted upon and the Plaintiffs"
"and their predecessors in title had possessed the land  on the rights they had"
"acquired by the deeds."
"In cross-examination,  with reference to the Defendant’s plan marked  වි5, the"
"Defendant had stated as follows,"
"ප්‍ර: එය තමාම නවනුනවන් සැදූ පිඹුරක්. හරිද?"
"උ: ඔේ."
"ප්‍ර: දැන් ඒ පිඹුනේ තිනෙනවා ඉඩේ නදකක් නවන් කරලා?"
"උ: ඔේ."
"ප්‍ර: එක ඉඩමක් තමන්ලා ඉන්න ඉඩම? නෙවල් නදකක් එනහම තිනෙනවා?"
"උ: ඔේ."
"ප්‍ර:  එය  දකුණු  ෙස්නාහිර  පැත්තට  තිබුනාට  ෙස්නාහිර  පැත්නතත්  ඉඩමක්  තිනෙනවා."
"නැනෙනහිර පැත්නතන් ඉඩමක් තිනෙනවා?"
"උ: නමම නඩුවට අදාළ ඉඩම තිනෙන්නන් නැනෙනහිර පැත්නත්."
"Therefore,  the  Defendant  had  admitted  the  fact  that  two  lands  are  shown"
"separately in plan වි5. If it was not the case and only one land is shown in වි5, the"
"Defendant should not have answered the question in the affirmative. Instead,"
"he should have denied the suggestion and stated that only one land is shown in"
