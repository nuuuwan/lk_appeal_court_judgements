"of  deeds,  even  a  fraudulent  deed  marked  subject  to  proof  can  be  used  as"
"evidence  if  it  is  not  objected  to  at  the  close  of  the  case  of  the  party  who"
"produced it. Abrew J further held as follows,"
"“I further hold that failure on the part of a party to object to a document during"
"the trial does not permit court to use the document as evidence if the document"
"which should be proved in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section"
"68 of the Evidence Ordinance has not been proved. I would like to note that the"
"acts  performed  or  not  performed  by  parties  in  the  course  of  the  trial  do  not"
"remove the rules governing the proof of documents”."
"The above observations also apply in a situation where a document had been"
"marked  without  subject 
to  proof.  However, 
in 
the  case  of  Banumathy"
"Puvirajakeerthy  v  Nadarajah  Indranee  –  CA/1222/2000(F),  D.C.  Batticaloa"
"4340/L  (decided  on  22.07.2020)  Justice  Janak  de  Silva  held  that  the  principle"
"introduced by Dadallage Anil Shantha Samarasinghe v Dadallage Mervin Silva"
"and another has no retrospective effect on its application. Justice de Silva has"
"stated as follows,"
"“In  my  view  applying  the  ratio  of  Dadallage  Anil  Shantha  Samarasinghe  v"
"Dadallage Mervin Silva and another to the instant case causes injustice to the"
"Plaintiff who was entitled to rely on the then applicable judicial precedent  Sri"
"Lanka Ports Authority and another v Jugolinija-Boal East”."
"The case of Dadallage Anil Shantha Samarasinghe v Dadallage Mervin Silva was"
"decided by the Supreme Court on 11.06.2019 and the judgment in this case had"
"been delivered by the District Court on 30.07.1999 nearly 20 years before the"
"Supreme Court judgment. At the trial the Plaintiffs were entitled to rely on the"
"then  applicable  judicial  precedent  and  an  injustice  would  be  caused  to  the"
"Plaintiffs 
in  this  case 
if  the  ratio  decidendi 
in  the  Dadallage  Anil  Shantha"
"Samarasinghe  case  is  applied  in  this  case.  Justice  Janak  de  Silva  has  already"
"decided 
that 
the  principle 
introduced 
by 
the  Dadallage  Anil 
Shantha"
"Samarasinghe  case  has  no  retrospective  effect  and  therefore,  I  hold  that  the"
"ratio decidendi in the Dadallage Anil Shantha Samarasinghe case will not apply"
"to this case. The applicable judicial precedent at the time of the pronouncement"
"of the judgment in the District Court was that a document which was marked"
"without subject to proof is admissible in evidence and it need not be proved."
