"Petitioner on exigencies of service in the Neonatal Unit of the Hospital. Subsequently, the"
"Director  has  assigned  the  Petitioner  to  the  Neonatal  Unit  by  his  letter  dated  10.02.2021,"
"marked ‘P20’."
"Only at the stage of filing the Statement of Objections, the Respondents took the stance that"
"the decision of the Director reflected in ‘P12’ is ultra vires and further, the Petitioner cannot"
"place any reliance on the Director’s letter, marked ‘P20’, on the basis that it has no validity in"
"law. The Respondents in paragraph 14 of their Statement of Objections categorically admit"
"the issuance of the letter, marked ‘P19’, by the 3rd Respondent but abstain from classifying the"
"said decision ultra vires."
"The Director after issuing the letter, marked ‘P12’, has addressed a letter dated 18.07.2020,"
"marked ‘P14’, to the Deputy Director General-Medical Services and has emphasized about"
"the strong objections raised by 8th Respondent in view of appointing the Petitioner to the post"
"of  Resident  Pediatrician  at  the  Hospital.  In  the  same  communication,  the  Director  has"
"requested  to  abolish  the  post  of  Resident  Pediatrician.  In  the  letter,  marked  ‘P19’,  the  3rd"
"Respondent has emphatically observed that the Petitioner has opted to be appointed as the"
"Resident  Pediatrician  of  the  Hospital  in  alignment  with  the  published  Annual  Specialists"
"Transfer  list  and  such  observations  imply  that  the  Petitioner  has  applied  for  the  said  post"
"merely because it was a post that was available in the said Transfer list."
"In  this  context,  it  appears  that  the  Petitioner  has  been  appointed  to  a  post  which,  in  the"
"opinion of the Director and the other Consultant Pediatricians including the 8th Respondent,"
"is redundant. The Petitioner has applied to the said post as it was a duly created post under"
"the  said  Annual  Transfer  list  and  the  PSC  has  made  the  Petitioner’s  appointment  after"
"finalizing  all  such  transfers  by  the  Ministry  of  Health.  It  is  apparent  that  the  PSC  has  no"
"involvement in creating posts, on its own, at any of the hospitals and such posts are usually"
"created and advertised according to specific requirements which are identified by the health"
"authorities and not by the PSC."
"The Petitioner has come before this Court setting out the difficulties she had to undergo after"
"appointing  her  as  the  Resident  Pediatrician  of  the  Hospital.  Declaring  the  decision  of  the"
"Director, marked ‘P12’, ultra vires by the Respondents and authorizing the Director to resolve"
