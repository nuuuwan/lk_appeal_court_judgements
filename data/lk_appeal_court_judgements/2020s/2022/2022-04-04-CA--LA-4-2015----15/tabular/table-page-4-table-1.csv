"After hearing both parties, this Court had granted leave to the Petitioner. When the Appeal was"
"taken up for argument, the Petitioner raised a preliminary issue stating that the tribunal's order is"
"wrong in law. It does not give any reasons or speak of how the compensation calculation was done."
"As  far  as  the  Petitioner  is  concerned,  he  received  only  the  document  marked  as  [X21].  The"
"Petitioner was unsatisfied with the amount of compensation the tribunal had decided to pay. He"
"had to lodge his application for leave to appeal in terms of the Act."
"However, the Petitioner argues that he has a right to know how the compensation was calculated."
"Even  his  Appeal  will  have  to  be  based  on  the  calculation  and  how  the  tribunal  concluded"
"calculating."
"In reply to the above argument, the Respondent pointed out that the documents marked [X18] and"
"[X21]  consist  of  the  order.  In  the  document  marked  [X18],  the  tribunal  had  given  all  the"
"breakdowns and how they arrived at a conclusion. Further, [X18] is a document the Petitioner had"
"himself forwarded to the Court and therefore, he cannot say he was unaware of [X18]."
"As there were many claimants, the tribunal had to lay down the breakdown of every claimant in"
"the document [X18]."
"Another argument of the Petitioner was that [X18] is not an order but a document addressed to the"
"Supreme Court. In reply, the Respondents pointed out that the subject matter of this case is just a"
"fraction of a larger picture. The entire problem was before the Supreme Court, and this is a unique"
"incident in which the Supreme Court had to intervene. The many members of the general public"
"who were affected had sought the intervention of the Supreme Court."
"The argument put forward by the Appellant was that he has a right to know the order proper [X18]"
"is not an order but only a statement. The Appellant argues that an order should consist of reasons"
"and should analyze the submissions and documents of the Petitioner."
"Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows, ""The judgement shall contain a concise"
"statement of the case, the points for determination, and decision thereon, and the reason for such"
"desition; and the opinions  of the assessors(if any) shall be prefixed to the judgment and signed by"
