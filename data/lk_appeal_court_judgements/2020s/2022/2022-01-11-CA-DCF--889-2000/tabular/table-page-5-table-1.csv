ince the learned District Judge is of the view that ‘letting’ can be oral, in the absence of a written"
"agreement, the Defendant has to prove whether the paddy land has been ‘let’ to him on an oral"
"agreement."

"applicability of the relevant provisions of Law."

"tenant cultivator of that extent."
"T
he word “let” contained in Section 2 of the Act, is defined in Section 68 as follows;"
"“let” with reference to any extent of paddy land, means to permit any person, under an oral or"
"written  agreement,  to  occupy  and  use  such  extent  in  consideration  of  the  performance  of  any"
"service by him or the payment of rent consisting of a sum of money or a share of the produce from"
"such extent."
"A

"original owner cultivator [William], the Defendant cannot be a tenant cultivator of the father."

"who was working the field with his father took up the position that, he was the ande cultivator of"
