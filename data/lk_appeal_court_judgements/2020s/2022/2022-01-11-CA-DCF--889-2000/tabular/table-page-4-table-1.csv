"It is seen that the Counsel for the Defendant relied upon the decision of Hendrick Appuhamy Vs."
"John Appuhamy [69 NLR 29] where his Lordship Sansoni J. held, that a landlord must resort to"
"the  Agrarian  Commissioner  to  eject  an  ande  cultivator  from  his  paddy  land  and  therefore,  the"
"District Court has no jurisdiction to decide that the Defendant is an ande cultivator."
"I
n  the  circumstances  of  the  said  Case,  parties  admitted  that  the  Plaintiff  is  the  owner  and  the"
"Defendant is the ande cultivator. In such a situation, the District Court has no jurisdiction to inquire"
"into any dispute relating to the paddy land."
"N
evertheless, in the instant Case, parties have disputed their status. Although the Defendant claims"
"that he is the ande cultivator, the Plaintiff instituted this action on the basis that the Defendant is a"
"trespasser. As such, it is clear that the dispute has arisen as to the status of the parties."
"T
he said legal position was clearly established in the Case of Herath Vs. Peter 1989 (2) S.L.R 325"
"and Kirihamy and Punchi Banda Vs. Siriwardena and Others 2002 (2) S.L.R 281."
"T
herefore, on this premise the Court has to first decide, whether the Defendant is a trespasser or"
"an ande cultivator.  I hold that the District Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the instant"
"action."
"A
pparently,  the  subject  matter  of  the  instant  action  is  a  paddy  land.  The  Plaintiffâ€™s  husband,"
"William Singho was the Permit holder of the subject matter in terms of the Land Development"
"Ordinance and he nominated his wife Karalenchihamy the Plaintiff as his successor, according to"
"the document marked as [P1]."
"A
s such, in view of the Judgment reported in 50 N.L.R 407 Palisena Vs. Perera, a permit holder"
"has a right to institute action to evict a trespasser from the disputed land. It is the contention of the"
"Appellant that the said William Singho cultivated the subject land [the paddy field] as the owner"
"cultivator and after his demise, his wife the said Karalenchihamy, the Plaintiff, became the owner"
"cultivator  of  the  impugned  paddy  field,  in  terms  of  Section  48A  (1)  of  the  Land  Development"
"Ordinance."
