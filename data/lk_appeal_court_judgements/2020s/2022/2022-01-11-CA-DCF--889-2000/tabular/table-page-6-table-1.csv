"In this Case Athukorale J. opined that; “It seem to me be inherently improbable that the son would"
"have been his own father’s tenant cultivator. Such position is contrary to the entries in the registers"
"where his father appears as the owner cultivator”."
"In that Case too, the Supreme Court held that there is no iota of evidence, to come to the conclusion"
"that he was the tenant cultivator thus the presumption under Section 45 applies."
