"was no rice mill.  The Petitioner has failed to give an explanation as to the contradictory position"
"she has taken on her petition and the  counter-objections. Thus, the 7th Respondent’s contention"
"that the Petitioner is guilty of suppression and misrepresentation of  material facts and also lying"
"under oath, succeeds."
"It was also the contention of the 7th Respondent that in paragraph 26 of the petition, it has been"
"stated that the Residential Project Manager of Walave Mahaweli Unit Embilipitya had informed"
"him that they cannot regularize the possession or issue permits to the Petitioner as there is active"
"litigation. However, the Petitioner has failed to establish this by any documentary evidence."
"The Respondents have also submitted to this Court that as per P13, which the Petitioner relied on"
"to  get  the  land  in  dispute,  she  had  submitted  that  she  or  her  children  do  not  have  any  other"
"commercial land within the Walave area belonging to the Mahaweli  Authority. However, in the"
"counter affidavit of the Petitioner in paragraph 10, the Petitioner had submitted that she had been"
"granted a plot of land for residential purposes which again contradicts the contents of her affidavit"
"marked as P13. Thus, in considering all the material that has been submitted to this Court, the 7th"
"Respondent’s submission that there is suppression and misrepresentation of material facts has to"
"succeed."
