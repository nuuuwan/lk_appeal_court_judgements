"It is the contention of the Petitioner, that as a result of the 7th Respondentâ€™s forceful occupation,"
"there had been several litigations. The 7th Respondent had instituted an action in the District Court"
"of  Embilipitiya.  (4559/L).  The  said  action  had  been  dismissed  by  the  District  Court  and  the"
"subsequent appeal to the Civil Appellate High Court by the 7th Respondent had also been dismissed"
"(Case  No.  SP  HCA  AP  228/2012).  Thereafter,  the  Petitioner  has  taken  steps  to  eject  the  7th"
"Respondent from the premises through the fiscal."
"The Petitioner thereafter made an application to obtain a permit from the 1st Respondent. It was"
"the contention of the Petitioner, that she had been present for a land kachcheri, and in the said land"
"kachcheri,  she  had  submitted  all  the  documents  to  establish  that  she  was  residing  in  the  said"

"to the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority."
"The Petitioner has used the said address of the premises when paying the taxes and also has paid"
"the  assessment  rates  for the  said  premises  from  2012 to  2015.  The  Petitioner  also tendered the"
"electricity bills she had paid for the premises (P 7B and 7C) and the assessment rates that had been"
"issued in her name (P-8A - P-8G) to demonstrate her possession of the land."
"It is the contention of the Petitioner, that after the land kachcheri the Petitioner had been named"
"and  selected  as  an  eligible  person  to  hold  a  permit  for  the  said  disputed  land.  However,  the"
"Petitioner  has  failed  to  submit  any  documentation  to  establish  this  ground  urged  by  her.  The"
"Petitioner also conceded that due to certain threats, she is now not in occupation of the premises"
"in dispute, but she had shifted to Kuruwita Ratnapura."
