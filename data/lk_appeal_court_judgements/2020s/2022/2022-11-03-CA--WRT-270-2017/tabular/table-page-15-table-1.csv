"only after the inquiring officerâ€™s recommendations had seen the light of day. However, none of the"
"parties have tendered the proceedings of the said inquiry to this Court. In the absence of the said"
"proceedings, this Court is not in a position to come to any conclusion pertaining to the conduct of"
"the said inquiry."
"Further,  the  Petitioner  after  having  taken  part  in  the  said  inquiry  without  any  objection,  had"
"submitted  herself  to the  jurisdiction  of  the  inquiry.  This  Court  also  observes  that the  Petitioner"
"after submitting herself to the inquiry now cannot be heard to complain about the outcome. The"
"Petitioner has failed to tender any material to demonstrate that she had objected to the manner in"
"which the inquiry was conducted before the recommendations were made available. This Court is"
"also mindful of the fact, that this Court cannot and should not assume the power of the inquiring"
"officer."
