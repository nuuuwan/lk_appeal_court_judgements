"to complain about this incident. She also stated that following this complaint the army came"
"to  that  place  and  stayed  there  for  a  long  time.  The  unfortunate  incident  relating  to  the"
"deceased person happened on the following day."
"Witness, Thayalan accepted during cross-examination that he did not mention anything about"
"the second accused person in his statement to the Police. It is important to note the major"
"contradiction in what he had said during the inquest and what he had said in the statement"
"given  to  the  Police  after  the  incident,  particularly  about  the  second  accused  person.  The"
"evidence was given by Nakuleswary, the mother of Thayalan has stated that she saw the first"
"and the second accused person and when the two ran towards the place of the incident, they"
"had knives in their hands. Later she said that she saw these two accused persons run back and"
"that the first accused person had a knife in his hand and the second accused person did not"
"have anything in his hand. This is an important matter in this case as far as the evidence for"
"the prosecution is concerned. According to Thayalan's evidence, the knife was in the hand of"
"the first accused person. He did not give evidence to say that the second- accused person had"
"anything like a knife in his hand."
"Thayalan's fifty-seven-year-old mother Nakuleswary, had stated that when the first and the"
"second accused persons ran, both of them had knives in their hands. When they came back"
"the second accused person did not have anything in his hand and the first accused person had"
"a  knife  in  his  hand.  The  other  important  argument  was  that  the  appellant  has  strongly"
"challenged  the  evidence 
led  under  section  27(1)  of  the  evidence  ordinance  and  raised"
"considerable doubt regarding the recovery of the knife described as the weapon with which"
"the  death  of  the  deceased  was  caused.  The 
learned  counsel  for  the  accused-appellant"
"submitted  that  the  evidence  led  by  the  defence  in  this  regard  has  not  been  fairly  and"
"reasonably  considered  by  the 
learned  trial  Judge  while  he  accepted  the  version  of  the"
"prosecution  without  adequate  analysis.  I  wish  to  consider  the  evidence  lead  before  the"
"learned High Court Judge at a later stage of this judgement and decide whether the decision"
"to convict the accused-appellant was fair and reasonable."
"It was further argued by the learned counsel for the accused-appellant that the learned Judge"
"has in his judgment, observed that the first charge of both accused murdering the deceased"
"Rasarathinam Uthayakumar, an offence punishable under section 296 of the penal code read"
"together  with  section  32  of the  same  code  failed.  Consequently,  the  only logical  and  legal"
"verdict should have been an order of acquittal of both accused and not the second accused"
"alone. Even this argument could be dealt with after I analysed the evidence led before the"
"trial Judge, at a later stage of this judgement."
"The 02nd witness for the prosecution, Tharmakulasingham Thayalan was produced as an eye"
"witness. His evidence was led before the Court on 14.05.2013, during which he stated that on"
"27.06.2001, while he was getting ready to go out to school, he witnessed this murder happen"
"before him about 100 meters away from his house. He gave evidence before Court that this"
"particular incident happened around 7.30 in the morning. The first accused person connected"
"to  the 
incident,  took  the  knife  from  the  second  accused  person  and  went  and  held"
"Rasarathinam Uthayakumar's head with his left hand and cut the left side of his neck with his"
"right hand. He also stated in his evidence, that even after the first accused person took the"
