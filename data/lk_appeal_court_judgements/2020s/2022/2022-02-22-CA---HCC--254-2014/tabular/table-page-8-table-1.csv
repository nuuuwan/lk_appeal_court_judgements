"He answered ""No"" to this question. That contradiction has been marked as D-1 in the record"
"of the inquest which is annexed in this case record and the proceedings of the lower Court."
"The learned counsel for the accused-appellant says that this is a major contradiction. The 13-"
"year-old  eye  witness  has  stated  during  the  inquest,  which  was  held  a  few  days  after  the"
"incident happened, that the first accused person snatched the knife from the second accused"
"person. It was further argued by the learned counsel that he could not have been vague in"
"this  matter.  But  during  the  trial  of  this  case  when  he  is  twenty-six  years  old  and  giving"
"evidence, he had said that the first accused person asked the second accused person for the"
"knife and took it."
"The learned counsel for the appellant submits that the attention of the court should be drawn."
"to the difference between a person asking for the knife from another person and snatching"
"the  knife  from  another  person.  Learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  raise  the  question  of"
"whether this witness witnessed this incident. One  reason for that is the contradiction that"
"had  indicated  in  his  evidence.  The  second  reason  is  that  fact  that  he  had  mentioned  that"
"everyone who was fighting with clubs ran away immediately after they saw the first accused"
"person with the knife. Counsel for the appellant raises a doubt saying that, is it an acceptable"
"fact that a thirteen-year-old boy who was watching the fight continued to stand in that place"
"even when everyone who was involved in the fight ran away?"
"Apart from this, during the defence trial, the first accused person had made a statement from"
"the dock. He had confirmed his presence at the time the fight occurred on that particular day."
"Poothathamby Mahenthiran, the second accused person had given evidence from the witness"
"box as a defence witness. He had stated in his evidence that he was a toddy tapper and that"
"he  had to  go  and  see  his  wife  in  the  Jaffna  Hospital on that day.  The  first  accused  person"
"claims an alibi and that has to be rebutted. When the prosecution witnesses are under cross-"
"examination, the defence was obligated to present their defence case very clearly before the"
"trial Court. It is my view that such an alibi was not produced under any circumstance when"
"the prosecution witnesses gave evidence but it was suddenly put forward when the second"
"accused person gave evidence from the witness box."
"During the cross-examination, his evidence was presented to Court in a manner where the"
"argument relating to the claim of alibi was a false one. The particular second accused person"
"had stated that he had gone to the hospital to see his wife at 5.30 on the morning of the said"
"incident and returned home at 8.05 am. But when he was questioned about the time taken"
"to go to the hospital by bus, he had answered 15 minutes and that the hospital was 2 '/2 miles"
"away from his house. Further, he had stated in his evidence that he went to the hospital and"
"saw his wife at the time when the visitors were allowed at 6.00 am and later, he came home"
"directly."
"This witness had said that he came out at 6.15 after seeing his wife. This witness said that he"
"left the hospital at 6.15 and that it will take  15 minutes to reach his house. Therefore, it is"
"placed before Court that this second accused person left the hospital at 6.15 and took another"
"15 minutes to reach home. He was at home by 6.30. The Court has to consider the alibi as a"
"false  argument.  The  particular  accused  person  to  work  at  Tharmakulasingham  Thayalan's"
"house had tied the rope and also said that when he goes to work, he uses equipment such as"
