"him on this particular day, only to clear the area around the second accused’s"
"house and no further. He claims that his son has cleared a further area around"
"the house of second accused, including part of the state forest on the persistent"
"request of the second accused who had alleged it was to protect the property from"
"wild elephant attacks. Thus, the appellant claims that his son has acted in strict"
"contradiction to his instructions."
"The appellant has thereafter visited the said location to observe the extent of the"
"area cleared. After observing that a section of the state forest has been cleared,"
"he has inquired his son as to why this was done and the son has stated that it"
"was on the insistence of the second accused, believing it to be a part of the second"
"accused’s property, and that he was unaware it was part of a state forest. It must"
"be  noted  that  the  appellant  has  claimed  that  there  was  no  fence  or  visible"
"boundary separating the forest from the second accused’s property."
"The appellant has stated in evidence that his son has been driving the said dozer"
"for  over  02  years  now  and  has  never  committed  an  offence.  As  the  vehicle  is"
"parked  at  the  appellant’s  house  at  all  times  when  not  in  use,  and  as  his  son"
"resides in the same house as the appellant, he claims that he is always alert as"
"to how and when the vehicle is used. He questions every evening after work about"
"what work was undertaken each day and instructs him (Appeal Brief page 40-"
"43)."
"When considering the submissions of the appellant, this Court must determine"
"whether the steps taken by the petitioner satisfies the burden cast on him by the"
"proviso to Section 40 of the Forest Conservation Ordinance. On a perusal of the"
"appeal brief and the evidence presented by the appellant, it has to be determined"
"that the appellant has dispensed the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the"
"court  that  he  had  taken  all  precautions  to  prevent  the  use  of  the  dozer  for"
"commission of the offence. Being constantly vigilant of the whereabouts and the"
"use of the dozer and handing over temporary control of it only to his son, and"
"frequently inquiring and instructing as to the type of work undertaken, indicate"
"that the appellant has taken all reasonable precautions to prevent the dozer being"
"used for any offence."
