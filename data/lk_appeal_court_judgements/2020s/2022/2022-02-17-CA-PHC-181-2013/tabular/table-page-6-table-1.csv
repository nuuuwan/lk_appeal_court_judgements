"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  Order,  the  1st  Party-1st  Respondent-Petitioner  had  invoked  the"
"revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Colombo by petition dated 05.03.2013."
"A
fter  supporting  the  said  application,  the  learned  Primary  Court  Judge  reserved  the  Order  for"
"16.12.2013 and delivered the Order refusing to issue notice on the Respondents stating that there"
"were  no  sufficient  grounds  to  issue  notice  and  thereafter  dismissed  the  said  application.  Being"
"aggrieved by the Order of the learned High Court Judge, the 1st Party-1st Respondent-Petitioner"
"Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant] had preferred this appeal."
"I
n the instant case, it is observed that the learned Primary Court Judge had not given possession of"
"the disputed premises to any of the parties.  It is relevant to note that the 2nd Party-Respondent-"
"Respondents and the  Intervenient Respondent-Respondent  had not  made any  application to  the"
"High Court to revise or set aside the impugned Order of the learned Primary Court Judge."
"D
espite  the  2nd  Party-Respondent-Respondents  being  served  notice  through  the  Fiscal  of  the"
"District Court of Colombo, had not participated in this appeal. Moreover, the notices issued on the"
"other Respondents were returned undelivered due to unavoidable circumstances.  However, it is"
"apparent that the 2nd Party Respondent-Respondents and the Intervenient Respondent-Respondent"
"had not shown due diligence in participating in this appeal."
"I
t appears that the learned Primary Court Judge has dealt with Section 68 of the Primary Courts’"
"Procedure Act and had decided that no one is entitled to the possession of the disputed premises"
"and had not given possession of the disputed premises to either of the parties on the ground that"
"the 1st Party-1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had failed to prove that he was in possession of"
"the  disputed  premises  two  months  prior  to  the  date  on  which  the  information  was  filed  on"
"16.05.2012."
"I
n terms of Section 72 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, a determination has to be made under"
"Section 68 or 69 of the Act, after examining and considering the following;"
"a)  The information filed and the affidavits and documents filed,"
