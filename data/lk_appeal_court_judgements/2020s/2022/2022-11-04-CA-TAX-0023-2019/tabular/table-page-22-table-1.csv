"In the case of Lanka Ashok Leyland PLC v. The Commissioner General of"
"Inland Revenue34  (hereinafter  referred to as  ‘Lanka Ashok  Leyland’)  the"
"identical issue of acknowledgment of an appeal had been decided and it"
"was held by the numerically equal bench of this Court that although the"
"statute provides that the appeal has to be submitted to the CGIR, there is"
"no  requirement  that  the  acknowledgement  also  should  be  made  by  the"
"CGIR himself. His Lordship Janak De Siva, J. stated at page 6 as follows;"
"‘Court  is  of  the  view  that  there  is  no  merit  in  the  submission  of  the"
"Appellant  that  the  acknowledgement  must  be  signed  by  the  Respondent."
"The functions of the Inland Revenue Department are so multifarious that"
"no Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue could ever personally attend"
"to  all  of 
them. 
In  particular,  Court  will  be  slow 
to 
impose  such"
"requirements unless there is unequivocal language in the IR Act. It is true"
"that the appeal has to be submitted to the respondent. However, that does"
"not mean that the acknowledgement to be made by the respondent. Similar"
"approach has been taken by our Courts in applying the Carltona principle"
"in  relation 
to  administrative 
functions 
to  be  performed  by  Ministers"
"(M.S.Perera v. Forest Department and another [(1982) 1 Sri. L.R. 187]"
"amd Kuruppu v. Keerthi Rajapakse, Conservator of Forests [(1982) 1 Sri."
"L.R. 163].’"
"T
he Appellant’s contention was that since the determination in the Lanka"
"Ashok Leyland had been made within the stipulated two-year period, the"
"foregoing statement of His Lordship Janak De Silva J., is obiter35. Yet, in"
"my  view,  although  the  facts  of  the  two  cases  are  slightly  different,  the"
"decision on the identical issue of validity the acknowledgment of an appeal"
"by an Assessor was shed light on the case in hand."
"The question of acknowledgement of an appeal arises out of Section 34 (8)"
"of the VAT Act. The Section stipulates the period within which an appeal"
"must  be  recognized  and,  also  provides  that,  where  it  has  not  been  so"
"acknowledged,  the  consequence  would  be  that  the  appeal  be  deemed  to"
"have  been  acknowledged  on 
the  day 
it  was  delivered 
to 
the  IRMF."
"However, it is important to observe that nowhere in the second proviso of"
"Section 34 (8) it is stated that the acknowledgement should also be done"
"by the CGIR himself, whereas Section 34 (6) to 34 (13) specifically state"
"the  functions  to  be  performed  by  the  CGIR.  It  is  important  to  note  that"
