"Courts  Procedure  Act  were 
to  be 
interpreted  as  directory,  and  not"
"mandatory."
"One cannot assume that there was any oversight by the Legislature when"
"Section 10 of the TAC Act was drafted and amended by not specifying the"
"consequences that result when the TAC does not strictly comply with the"
"prescribed deadline. This is further supported by the fact that, as submitted"
"by  counsel  for 
the  Appellant  himself, 
the  relevant  section  has  been"
"amended twice. This means that the Legislature had the opportunity on two"
"occasions to specify the consequences of non-compliance, even though it"
"saw fit not to do so."
"In the case of Mohideen v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,10"
"His Lordship Gooneratne J. (sitting in the Court of Appeal) made a similar"
"observation when considering the intention of the Legislature regarding the"
"time limit available for the Board of Review (which was the body that was"
"replaced by the TAC) to reach its determination:"
"‘If  it  was  the  intention  of  the  legislature  that  hearing  (sic)  should  be"
"concluded within 2 years from the date of filing the petition or that the time"
"period of 2 years begins to run from the date of filing the petition,  there"
"could not have been a difficulty to make express provision, in that regard"
"(emphasis added).’"
"In  light  of  certain  tax  statutes  passed  by  our  Parliament,  I  note  that  the"
"Legislature, in its wisdom, has specifically enacted in Section 165 (6) of"
"the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the IR"
"Act’), as amended, that failure to acknowledge receipt of an appeal within"
"thirty days of receipt should result the appeal being deemed to have been"
"received  on  the  day  on which  it  is  delivered  to  the  CGIR.  Furthermore,"
"Section 165(14) of the IR Act provides that failure to dispose of an appeal"
"within two years of its receipt should result in the appeal being allowed and"
"tax  charged  accordingly.  Similarly,  Section  34  (8)  of  the  VAT  Act  also"
"provides that the failure to determine an appeal within the specified time"
"limit should result in the appeal being allowed and tax charged accordingly."
"Inland  Revenue  Act  No.  24  of  2017,  which  is  in  force  as  at  now,  also"
"provides  for  an  Administrative  Review  of  an  assessment  by  the  CGIR."
"However, unlike in the previous Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, no"
