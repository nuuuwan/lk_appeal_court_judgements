"referred to as  ‘PSL’)  for the  manufacture  of  Signal  toothbrushes.  Those"
"facts are undisputed."
"Analysis"
"Is the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission time barred?"
"The learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the TAC"
"made  its  determination  beyond  the  prescribed  time  limit  resulting  the"
"appeal being abated.  It was also submitted that this has the practical effect"
"of allowing the appeal4. That gives rise to the first question of law."
"In  my  view, 
the  above  question 
is 
twofold:  Did 
the  TAC  make 
its"
"determination within the deadline and is the deadline mandatory? It does"
"not appear necessary to restate the sequence of events to determine whether"
"the determination of the TAC was within the timeframe. This allegation"
"was not contested by the learned Additional Solicitor General and the Court"
"is satisfied that the TAC in fact exceeded the time limit. The Respondent"
"argued  that  the  period  specified  for  determination  by  the  TAC  merely"
"directory."
"This  allows  me  to  move  directly to  the question of whether  compliance"
"with the timeline is mandatory, or just directory."
"The 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for 
the  Appellant  argued 
that 
the"
"Legislature, by amending the above provision, not only once but twice with"
"retrospective effect and having an avoidance of doubt clause in Section 15,"
"clearly manifested its intention of enacting the time frame provided for the"
"conclusion of an appeal to be mandatory5."
"However,  I  am  not  inclined  to  accept  the  submission  of  the  learned"
"President’s  Counsel  for  the  Appellant.  The  Legislature,  at  first  having"
"extended 
the 
one-hundred-and-eighty-day 
period 
from 
the"
"commencement of the hearing, up to two hundred and seventy days, later"
"reduced the said period by enacting that the time should take effect from"
"the commencement of sittings for the hearing, which would precede the"
"hearing itself."
