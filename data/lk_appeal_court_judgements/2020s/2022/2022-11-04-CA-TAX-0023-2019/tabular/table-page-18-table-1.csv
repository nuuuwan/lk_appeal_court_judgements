"It is important to note that Section 34 (6) itself provides that on receipt of"
"a valid petition of appeal the CGIR may cause further inquiry to be made"
"by an Assessor other than the Assessor who made the assessment in appeal."
"But there is nothing of the sort in Section 34 (8). Hence, it is apparent that"
"the acknowledgement of an appeal under Section 34 (8) is not an act which"
"should  be  done  by  the  CGIR  personally  or  by  a  statutorily  authorised"
"officer."
"H
ence, 
it 
is  clear 
that 
the 
intention  of 
the  Legislature 
in  enacting"
"aforementioned provisions in Section 34 (6) and (7) and 70 (2) are not to"
"curtail the authority of the CGIR causing an Assessor to do any act which"
"is to be done under the VAT Act."
"T
he learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant, profusely referring to"
"Section 70 (2) argued that the effect of the Section is that the CGIR himself"
"should acknowledge the appeal and it is sufficient if his name is printed on"
"the notice. The Appellant’s submission on printing the name of the CGIR"
"on the acknowledgement is apparently based on Section 60 of VAT. If the"
"Court is to uphold the above, it must first be satisfied that acknowledgment"
"of an appeal is a duty incumbent on the CGIR himself."
"T
he Appellant also submitted that in the alternative the appeal has to be"
"acknowledged  by  an  agent  of 
the  CGIR,  under  delegated  power25."
"Nevertheless, it was submitted that the famous doctrine known as Carltona"
"principle,  which 
is  a  principle  of  English  Constitutional  Law 
is  not"
"applicable 
to 
the  case  at  hand  where 
there 
is  a  statutory  power  of"
"delegation.  The  learned  Counsel  cited  the  following  extract  from  Lord"
"Woolf, Sir Jeffrey Jowell, Catherine Donnelly and Ivan Hare (eds), in De"
"Smith’s Judicial Review26 which reads thus;"
"‘The  Carltona  principle  may  be  expressly  excluded  by  legislation,  but"
"whether it may in addition be excluded by statutory implication remains"
"uncertain.  Two  situations  should  be  distinguished.  Where  a  power  of"
"delegation  is  expressly  conferred  by  Parliament  on  a  minister,  it  may"
"compel the inference that Parliament intended to restrict the devolution of"
"power  to  the  statutory  method,  thus  impliedly  excluding  the  Carltona"
"principle.  Commonwealth  authority,  however,  suggests 
that  such  an"
"implication will not readily be drawn. It has also been suggested that the"
"principle may be impliedly excluded where it appears inconsistent with the"
