"by the company, bearing in mind that the section is a penal one and should"
"not be strained to cover transactions which are not fairly within it.’"
"Accordingly, it was submitted that when looking at transactions challenged"
"under a law, the Court must look to the commercial realities of what had"
"taken place."
"It was also cited the following comment made by Peter Smith J., in Anglo"
"Petroleum  Limited  and  Paul  Sutton  v.  TFB 
(Mortgages)  Limited41"
"regarding the aforementioned dictum of Hoffmann J.;"
"‘In effect what he is saying is that if a transaction has a lawful and bona"
"fide  purpose 
the  court  should  not  strain 
the  section 
to  render 
the"
"transactions illegal.’"
"At this point, it is appropriate to examine the terms of the agreements USL"
"has entered with RMCC and PSL to verify their commercial reality."
"In the South African case of Rumbles v. Kwa BAT Marketing (Pty) Ltd it"
"was observed that contractual terms were not definitive of the nature of any"
"legal  relationship  that  may  exist.42  The  Court  will  have  regard  to  the"
"realities of the relationship between the parties in order to determine the"
"true nature of the relationship between them."
"Although, this was a case on labour law, in the Sri Lankan case of  Free"
"Lanka Trading Co. Ltd. v. De Mel, Commissioner of Labour and Others43"
"the Supreme Court held that the description of a relationship in a written"
"agreement between parties was not determinative of the status of parties"
"and that the nature of actual work done and the extent of control exercised"
"were decisive factors."
"Therefore, I will now examine the status of parties as reflected in the terms"
"and conditions of the agreement."
"The agreement between the Appellant and RMCC is at page 39 (20) of the"
"appeal  brief.  According to  the  agreement it is between Unilever  Ceylon"
"Limited  and  RMCC.  However,  the Appellant  conceded that  this was  an"
"agreement  between 
the  Appellant,  Unilever  Sri  Lanka  Limited  and"
"RMCC44."
