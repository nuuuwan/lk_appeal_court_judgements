"","he can delegate his power to another officer authorising him to sign the"
"","acknowledgment on his behalf. There may be thousands of taxpayers in Sri"
"Lanka  and 
the  acknowledgement  of  appeals  submitted","to 
the  CGIR"
"personally  would  be  an 
impossible  exercise.","In  my  view 
that 
the"
"","acknowledgment of an appeal is a step within the process of making further"
"","inquiries into the appeal submitted by the taxpayer.  Therefore, I am of the"
"","view, the Assessor, acknowledging an appeal acting on the directions given"
"","by the CGIR under Section 34 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act is valid in"
"law.  The  nature  of  an  acknowledgment  of  an  appeal","is  merely  an"
"","administrative  act.    Therefore,  the  only  reasonable  inference  this  Court"
"","could draw is that the Assessor has acknowledged the appeal on the implied"
"delegation of authority by the CGIR.",""
"","Accordingly,  the  argument  of  the  Appellant’s  learned  Counsel  that  the"
"name 
of 
the  CGIR 
should 
have 
been 
printed 
in","the 
letter 
of"
"","acknowledgement pursuant to Section 60 (1) of the VAT Act and whoever"
"","acknowledges the appeal, should do so in the name of the CGIR also has"
"no merit.",""
"I","n terms of Section 34 (8) of the Act every appeal must be determined by"
"","the CGIR within a period of two years from the date of its receipt. On the"
"","above  analysis  I  hold  the  appeal  has  been  duly  acknowledged  by  the"
"","Assessor’s letters dated 13th May 2014. The second proviso to Section 34"
"","(8)  provides  that  if  an  appeal  is  acknowledged  within  thirty  days  of  its"
"","receipt, the date of the letter of acknowledgment shall be deemed to be the"
"","date of receipt of such appeal. The CGIR has made his determination on"
"the 2nd May 2016, within the stipulated two-year period.",""
"","Thus, for the reasons enunciated above, it is my considered view that the"
"","determination of the CGIR is not time barred. Accordingly, the question as"
"to whether the appeal is deemed to be allowed will not arise.",""
"","I  therefore  hold  that  the  TAC  did  not  err  in  law  when  it  came  to  the"
"","conclusion  that  the  determination  of  the  CGIR  was  not  time  barred."
"","Consequently,  I  answer  the  second  question  of  law  in  the  negative,  in"
"favour of the Respondent.",""
"Whether the Appellant is a manufacturer pursuant to the VAT Act?",""
"","The  principal  issue  in  this  appeal  is  whether  the  Appellant  (USL),  or"
"","RMCC  and  PSL  are  the  manufacturers  of  Vim  scourer  bars  and  Signal"
"toothbrushes within the meaning of the provisions of the VAT Act.",""
