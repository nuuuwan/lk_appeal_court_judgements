"Accordingly,  having  given  due  consideration 
to  all  of 
the 
learned"
"President’s Counsel’s submissions on this question of law, I hold that the"
"determination of the TAC is not time barred."
"As a result, I answer the first question of law in the negative, in favour of"
"the Respondent."
"Whether 
the  determination  of 
the  Commissioner  General

"T
he Appellant lodged its appeals with the CGIR on the 25th April 2014."
"Thereafter, the Assessor Inoka Dharmarwardana of the Large Taxpayers"
"Appeal  Unit  acknowledged  the  appeals  by  letter  dated  13th  May  2014,"
"within thirty days of its receipt. The CGIR made his determination on the"
"2nd May 2016. The learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant argued"
"that  an  Assessor  is  not  statutorily  authorized  to  acknowledge  an  appeal"
"made to the CGIR23 and that since there was no proper acknowledgement"
"of the appeals, the appeals should be deemed to have been received by the"
"CGIR on the 25th April 2014, the day those were delivered to the CGIR."
"On 
the  basis  of 
the 
foregoing  premise, 
the  Appellant  argued 
that"
"assessments  No.  7146148  (11030),  7145475  (11060),  7145476  (11090),"
"7145477  (11120)  for  the  quarters  ending  on  31.03.2011,  30.06.2011,"
"30.09.2011 and 31.12.2011 respectively that are the subject matter of this"
"appeal are time barred."
"I
 will start the analysis with reproducing the second proviso to Section 34"
"(8) which reads as follows;"
