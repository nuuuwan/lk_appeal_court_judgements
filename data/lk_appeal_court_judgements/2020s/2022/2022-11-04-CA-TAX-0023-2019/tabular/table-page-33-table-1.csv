"I
n view of the foregoing analysis, I answer the third question of law in the"
"negative, in favour of the Respondent."
"Is the determination of the Tax Appals Commission against the weight"
"of the evidence?"
"In  light  of  the  preceding  analysis  of  facts  related  to  this  case,  it  is  my"
"considered  view  that  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  having  analysed  the"
"evidence properly and giving due weight to such evidence has arrived at"
"the correct conclusion."
"Hence, I answer the fourth question of law in the negative, in favour of the"
"Respondent."
"Did  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  err  in  law  when  it  came  to  the"
"conclusion that it did?"
"For the reasons  set out above  and having considered  the preceding  four"
"questions of law, I hold that the TAC did not err in law when it arrived at"
"the conclusion that it did."
"Accordingly, I answer the fifth question of law in the negative, in favour"
"of the Respondent."
"Conclusion"
"Thus, having considered all the arguments presented to this Court, I hold"
"that the TAC has not erred in arriving at its final determination."
"Therefore,  I  answer  all  five  questions  in  the  negative,  in  favour  of  the"
"Respondent."
