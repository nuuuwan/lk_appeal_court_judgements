"those products in Sri Lanka54. Therefore, it is the Appellant who is legally"
"entitled 
to  manufacture 
the  above  goods.  Such  goods  can  only  be"
"manufactured  under  the  authority  granted  by  the  Appellant.  If  not,  the"
"manufacture  of 
those  goods  would  constitute  an  infringement  of  the"
"Appellant's  intellectual property  rights.  Hence, there  cannot  be  a  legally"
"valid sale of goods to USL either by RMCC or PSL."
"A
s I have already stated above in this judgment, supply of goods means the"
"passing of exclusive ownership of goods to another as the owner of such"
"goods or under the authority of any written law. Therefore, no valid sale of"
"goods can take place in the transaction between RMCC and PSL, and USL."
"Since there is no passing of exclusive ownership of goods from RMCC and"
"PSL to the USL, it amounts to a supply of services. The Appellant argued"
"that RMCC and PSL are  the sole parties engaged in all of the activities"
"described  in  the  definition  of  manufacturer  of  the  Vim  scourer  bars  and"
"Signal  toothbrushes,  and  therefore  Appellant  is  not  the  manufacturer."
"However, it should be noted that section 3 of the VAT Act only applies to"
"supply of goods. Contrastingly, RMCC and PSL are engaged in a supply"
"of services. Thus, it is evident that the Appellant is the manufacturer of the"
"supply of goods and not RMCC and PSL. Hence, the exemption claimed"
"by the Appellant under section 3 of the VAT Act is not applicable here."
"T
he  Appellant’s  contention  was  that  it  has  only  engaged  in  buying  and"
"selling55  of  Signal 
toothbrushes  and  Vim  scourer  bars  and  does  not"
"manufacture and sell these goods."
"I
n  the  Indian case of  Whirlpool of India Ltd. Bangalore vs.  The Deputy"
"Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Bangalore,56 where the facts of the"
"case were similar to the case at hand, Markandey Katju, J. stated that;"
"‘
sales  made  by  M/s.  Applicomp  to  the  Appellant  are  not  sales  to  the"
"exclusive marketing agent or distributor or wholesaler or any other dealer"
"but are only sales of manufactured branded goods to the brand owner’."
"A
pplying the same line of argument, it can be seen that the sales by RMCC"
"and PSL to the Appellant are not sales to a wholesaler or a retailer but sales"
"to  the  brand  owner.  Hence,  as  the  Appellant  is  neither  a  retailer  nor  a"
"wholesale supplier but the manufacturer of the goods, the Appellant cannot"
"claim the exemption under section 3 of the VAT Act."
