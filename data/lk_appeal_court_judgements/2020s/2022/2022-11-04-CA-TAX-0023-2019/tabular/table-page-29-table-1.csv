"The agreement states that the appellant invited RMCC India to establish a"
"manufacturing unit in Sri Lanka and to this end, RMCC has established a"
"wholly owned subsidiary in Sri Lanka to produce  Vim scourer bars. The"
"duration of the agreement between the two parties was initially for a period"
"of  five  years.  The  parties  have  agreed  to  ensure  a  stipulated  return  on"
"investment (ROI) to RMCC on its invested funds and the cost of the plant"
"would be reimbursed in five years45. However, in the event the agreement"
"is 
terminated  by  either  party  under 
the 
termination  clauses  of 
the"
"agreement, RMCC will be the sole owner of the plant and machinery46."
"Therefore, in an early termination of the agreement RMCC will be entitled"
"to  the  plant  and  machinery  which  they  have  setup.  The  Appellant  is"
"required to repay the RMCC’s investment within five years. RMCC has"
"agreed not to enter into any agreements with other parties for the supply of"
"products out of the premises and plant without the consent of the Appellant."
"From  the  aforementioned  clauses  it  is  clear  that  RMCC  has  setup  the"
"manufacturing  unit 
in  Sri  Lanka  on 
the 
invitation  of 
the  Appellant"
"exclusively for the manufacture of Vim scourer bars for the Appellant. In"
"fact, the Appellant is required to repay the RMCC’s investment within five"
"years."
"Focusing on the clauses regarding manufacturing of Vim scourer bars, the"
"Appellant representing the brand name Vim has permitted RMCC to use"
"the  said  trademark47.  The  Appellant  will  communicate  the  quantity  and"
"supply schedule of the product to RMCC and RMCC will manufacture and"
"supply  the  finished  products  in  accordance  with  the  specifications  and"
"quantities  communicated  by  the  Appellant.  The  raw  materials,  packing"
"materials,  bags,  wrappers,  pouches, 
labels  and  other 
inputs 
for 
the"
"manufacture of the finished goods will be arranged by USL, for RMCC to"
"purchase and procured on its own48. RMCC has expressly agreed not to"
"claim  any  right  or  ownership  or  goodwill  in  any  of  the  trademarks  or"
"material used by them in the manufacture of finished products49."
"RMCC has agreed not to enter into any agreements with other parties for"
"the supply of products out of the premises and plant without the consent of"
"the Appellant. This condition makes it clear that the plant is setup in the"
"premises, exclusively for manufacturing the Appellant products."
