"Within this power, the 1st Respondent had asked to show cause by the Appellant."
"T
he Appellant had argued that Section 21( 1) (e) refers to a person who had received a loan. As he"
"had not obtained any loan, this section will have no bearing on him."
"W
hen someone signs as a surety, he agrees to be bound to pay any money dishonoured by the"
"principle. Therefore,  when the principal leaves  any money unpaid, the creditor has  the right to"
"demand from  the surety. Thus, the argument  that he did  not  borrow though technically  correct"
"cannot be interpreted for this section. The Appellant must fall into the category of a borrower."
"A
pplication made by Appellant before the Provincial High Court in HCWA/15/2013 was for a"
"writ  of  prohibition  prohibiting  the  1st  Respondent  from  declaring  that  the  Petitioner  has  been"
"disqualified  from  being  elected to  the Committee. When perusing the letter [X1] on which the"
"Appellant had based his case. There is no such danger to him. The Appellant had taken legal action"
"before sending a reply to [X1]."
"A
t the time of sending [X1], the Respondent may not have known that Joseph Perera had settled"
"the  loan.  The  Appellant  should  have  sent  his  reasons  before  rushing  to  court.  There  was  no"
"imminent danger on the face of [X1]. No evidence of imminent danger was shown at the High"
"Court. When praying for a writ, one must satisfy the court; unless the writ is issued, there will be"
"a breach of a right. When perusing the High Court's case record proceedings, nothing of this nature"
"can be seen."
"E
ven though the Appellant tries to show that the High Court Judge had come to a conclusion that"
"the  1st  Respondent  had  already  taken  a  decision,  a  careful  perusal  of  the  order  shows  no  such"
"determination. The Judge had held that the 1st Respondent had acted within his powers to safeguard"
"the institution. The order issued by the 1st Respondent referred to in the judgment is an order calling"
"for  show  cause.  There  was  no  final  order  in  [X1]  other  than  an  order  calling  for  show  cause."
"Therefore, one must interpret the order of the learned High Court Judge with the contents of the"
"subject in issue."
