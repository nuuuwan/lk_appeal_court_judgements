"the 5th Deceased Defendant and the 6th Defendant, by Deed bearing No. 1902 dated"
"02.121976 marked as 5වි3."
"Therefore, it is noteworthy that the 5th Deceased Defendant and the 6th Defendant-"
"Respondent are entitled to 112 perches of the corpus sought to be partitioned. As"
"such, the learned District Judge has erroneously allocated only 43.04 perches to the"
"5th  Deceased  Defendant  and  the  6th  Defendant-Respondent.  Thus,  it  has  to  be"
"corrected as 112 perches."
"Hence, we allow the appeal bearing No.  582/2000 (F) preferred by 5අ Defendant"
"Appellants and amend the schedule of shares accordingly."
"It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  4th  Defendant-Appellant  had  preferred  appeal  bearing"
"No.584/2000(F) and sought to have the Judgment of the District Court set aside  and"
"prayed to have the corpus partitioned among the parties according to the evidence"
"available in the instant case or to dismiss the plaint."
"Court draws the attention to the petition of appeal preferred by the 4th Defendant-"
"Appellant. The 4th Defendant-Appellant has stated in paragraph 12 of the petition"
"that  the  original  Plaintiff  is  not  entitled  to  an  undivided  21/48  share  or  830.97"
"perches according to the documents tendered and the evidence adduced at the trial"
"and that the entire land has to be partitioned again and further stated that the 4th"
"Defendant-Appellant is entitled to more than 158.28 perches."
"However, the 4th Defendant-Appellant had not substantiated the above position by"
"giving sufficient reasons in the argument and it is apparent that there is no merit in"
"his appeal."
"Hence,  we  dismiss  the  appeal  bearing  No  584/2000(F)  preferred  by  the  4th"
"Defendant-Appellant."
"It was the contention of the 11th Defendant that the land described in the statement"
"of claim of the 11th Defendant was possessed by the predecessors and 11th Defendant"
"for more than 40 years and hence had claimed a prescriptive right."
"Accordingly, the 11th Defendant in her statement of claim prayed inter alia;"
"(a) To dismiss the Plaintiff’s action;"
