"The object of requiring security is to avoid frivolous and vexatious appeals"
"as well  as to  ensure  that  once  an appeal  is concluded  those  moneys  are  readily"
"available  to the Department of Inland Revenue. It should be noted that the said"
"Section  was  introduced  by  Act  No.  20  of  2013  to  ensure  the  money  can  be"

"appeal  is  given.”"
"Therefore, the purpose of furnishing the said security is to ensure that the"
"money is readily available to be recovered at the conclusion of the appeal."
