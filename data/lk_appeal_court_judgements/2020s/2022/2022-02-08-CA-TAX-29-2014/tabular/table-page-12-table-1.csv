"which requiring to furnish security, confers a discretion only on the Tax Appeals"
"Commission."

"Section 7 (1) of the TAC Act."
"P

"under paragraph (a) shall, at the time of making of such appeal, be required to"
"pay  into  a  special  account  which  shall  be  opened  and  operated  by  the"
"Commission for such purpose, an amount-"
"a)  as is equivalent to ten per centum which is non- refundable; or"
"b)  as is equivalent to twenty five per centum which is refundable subject"
"to  subsection  (1A)  of  this  Section  or  a  bank  guarantee  for  the"
"equivalent amount which  shall  remain  valid  until  the  appeal  is"
"determined by the Commission."
"There  is  no  dispute  when  the  Appellant  lodged  the  appeal  to  the  Tax"
"Appeals  Commission,  the  Appellant  has  informed  that  there  was  no  need  to"
"make a fresh deposit as there was a tax credit which is more than 25 percent of"

"by the said section."
