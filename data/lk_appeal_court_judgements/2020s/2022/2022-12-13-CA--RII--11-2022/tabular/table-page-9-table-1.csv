"The 8th Defendant-Appellant Petitioner by Petition dated 18th March 2022 seeks to"
"invoke this Court’s revisionary and/or restitutionary jurisdiction in order to, inter alia,"
"set  aside  the  judgment  of  the  District  Court,  Matara  dated  28th  February  1995,  the"
"interlocutory decree dated 21st February 2000 and the final decree dated 21st February"
"2000."
"When the matter was supported before us on the 10th of November, we observed"
"that  the  Petitioner  had  previously  preferred  an  appeal  against  the  judgment  of  the"
"District Court to this Court (Case No. 125/95(F)), and that appeal had been  dismissed."
"The issue before us is whether we can entertain a revision or restitution application after"
"the same matter has been dealt with and disposed of by this Court. We are of the view"
"that we cannot sit in revision over a previous decision of ours. His Lordship A.W.A. Salam"
"J. in Stephan Gunaratne v. Thushara Indika Sampath CA/PHC/APN/54/2013 decided on"
"23.09.2013 succinctly observed: “the Court of Appeal cannot act in revision in respect of a"
"j
udgment it pronounces in a civil appeal.”  This position is buttressed by the clear wording"
"of Article 138 of the Constitution, from which provision this Court receives its power of"
"revision and restitution."
"Further, there is a delay of nearly of twenty years in filing the instant application,"
"for which there is no explanation proffered in the Petition. It is well-settled law that those"
"applicants  seeking  discretionary  remedies  of  this  Court  must  act  with  promptitude  in"
"making an application. (Vide Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation v. Shanmugam [1995] 1"
