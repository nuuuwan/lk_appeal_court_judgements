"In  the  case  of  Somaratne  Rajapakse  Others  v  Hon.  Attorney  General"
"(2010) 2 Sri L.R. 113 Justice Bandaranayake observed that:"
"“With all this damning evidence against the Appellants with the"
"charges  including murder  and rape  the  Appellants did not offer"
"any  explanation  with  regard  to  any  of  the  matters  referred  to"
"above.  Although  there  cannot  be  a  direction  that  the  accused"
"person must explain each and every circumstance relied on by the"
"prosecution and the fundamental principle being that no person"
"accused of a crime is bound to offer any explanation of his conduct"
"there are permissible limitations in which it would be necessary"
"for a suspect to explain the circumstances of suspicion which are"
"attached to him.”"
