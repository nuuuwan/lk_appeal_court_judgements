"In  the  case  of Bharwada  Bhoginbhai  Hirjibhai  v  State  of  Gujarat [1983]"
"AIR SC 753 the court held that:"
"“Discrepancies  which  do  not  go  to  the  root  of  the  matter  and"
"shake  the  basic  version  of  the  witnesses  therefore  cannot  be"
"annexed with undue importance. More so when the all-important"
"“probabilities-factor” echoes in favour of the version narrated by"
"the witnesses”."
