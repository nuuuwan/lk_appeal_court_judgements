"unanimously laid down the following tests to be applied in determining whether a question",""
"of law is substantial or not;",""
"i.","A question of law which has been definitely settled by the Supreme Court or in respect"
"","of which there is no difference of opinion is not a substantial question of law. It should"
"","be such as to impress the Court that it is debatable in view of the authorities or that the"
"","authorities themselves may require reconsideration. It must be such that there may be"
"","some doubt or difference of opinion or there is room for difference of opinion."
"ii.","A question of law will not be substantial merely because much is at stake on the answer"
"","to it."
"iii.","The world ""substantial"" does not imply that  the question of law must be of general"
"","interest or importance. It is sufficient if a substantial question of law, as between the"
"","parties to the litigation is involved. This however does not mean that every question"
"","of law as between the parties is a substantial question. A question of law is substantial"
"","between  the  parties  if  the  decision  turns  one way  or  another  on  the particular  view"
"","taken  of  the  law.  If  it  does  not  affect  the  decision,  then  it  cannot  be  substantial  as"
"","between the parties. An important or difficult question would of course be a substantial"
"","question;  but  even  if  a  question  is  not  important  or  difficult,  if  there  is  room  for"
"","reasonable difference of opinion on the question then it would be a substantial question"
"","of law."
"iv.","If there is a conflict of judicial opinion and there is no direct decision of the Highest"
"","Court on the question of law raised then there would be a substantial question of law."
"v.","If the question of law raised is a question of law directly and substantially affecting the"
"","rights of the parties and if it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled"
"","by  the  Supreme  Court  or  is  not  free  from  difficulties  or  calls  for  discussion  of"
"","alternative views then, it is a mere question of applying well settled principles. If the"
"","plea raised is palpably absurd, the question would not be a substantial question of law."
"vi.","Orders passed in the exercise of the discretion of the Court do not ordinarily involve a"
"","substantial question of law but a question whether a Court could in law, exercise any"
"","discretion at all in a given I case, is a substantial question of law."
