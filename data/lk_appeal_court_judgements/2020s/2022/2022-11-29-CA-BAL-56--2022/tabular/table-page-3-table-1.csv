"MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J."
"The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to the suspect namely ChamiKa"
"Dikini Paranwitharana the provisions of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims"
"of Crime and Witnesses Act."
"The Counsel for the suspect stated that the suspect and six others were produced"
"before the Magistrate of Galle for causing mischief and grievous hurt on 30.5.2022"
"and had been remanded. But on 4.7.2022 the Magistrate had been informed that"
"action would be considered under the provisions of the above mentioned act as"
"such bail had been refused to the instant suspect."
"The grievance of the Counsel for the suspect was that the 2nd respondent reported"
"facts under the instant act in order to keep the suspect in remand and he quoted"
"the example of the petitioner to this application who is the father of the suspect"
"who had been once produced for the same offence and later released for lack of"
"evidence. This Court also observes that on 27.6.2022 the petitioner and the instant"
"suspect have been granted bail but it  had been cancelled once facts had been"
"reported under the instant act. Therefore the Counsel for the suspect further said"
"that the provisions of the instant act have been used for the purpose of implicating"
"the wrong person in order to overcome personal grievances. Upon perusing of the"
"case record also we observe that the same submission has been made before the"
"Magistrate as well but the Magistrate has cited the law pertaining to the instant"
"matter and had refused bail."
"The Counsel for the suspect further averred that the suspect is due to sit for the"
"Advance Level examination this year and to consider the same as an exceptional"
"ground."
