"strenuously stated that the petitioners do not have locus standy to appear in this"
"matter and as such cited the judgment of Dehideniya J  CA(PHC)APN 144/2016, in"
"which the term  locus standi and aggrieved party has been discussed."
"It has said that “the intervenient petitioners must show that they have sufficient"
"interest  in  the  matters  to  which  the  revision  applications  relates  to……’  and  has"
"gone  on  to  cite  the  dictum  of  Lord  Denning  in  R.V.Paddington  Valuation  Office"
"(1996) 1 QB380 at401 which has discussed locus standi and had cited A.R.Perera"
"and Others VS Central Freight Bureau of Sri Lanka and another (2006)1 SLR 83 in"
"which it has been held as “the Court would not listen,. To mere busy body that is"
"interfering in things which did not concern him. But it will listen to anyone whose"
"interests are affected by what has been done”."
"Therefore  as  the  petitioners  were  given  the  custody  of  the  animals  and  as  the"
"animals were handed over to the 5th respondent in contravention of the provisions"
"of the act and as the petitioners are a welfare organization for animals, this Court"
"is  of  the  opinion  that  as  per  the  judgment  cited  above  the  petitioners  have  a"
"grievance to be addressed and as such as decided in the judgment cited above the"
"petitioners are an aggrieved party."
"As such it is the opinion of this Court that the Magistrate has founded his order on"
"improper procedure which makes it an illegal order, hence the learned High Court"
"Judge in refusing the application of the petitioners has caused a grave miscarriage"
"of injustice which prompts this Court to act in revision and set aside the order of the"
"Magistrate and the judgment of the High Court."
"As such the instant application for revision is allowed and the paragraphs in the"
"prayer to the petition, a, b, and c are hereby granted."
