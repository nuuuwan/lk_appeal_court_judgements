"are the a certificate issued by the Gramasevaka from the area of the 5th respondents"
"and E3 is a voucher by the previous owner of the buffaloes."
"In the meantime the petitioners had been handed over the buffaloes at the inception"
"of the inquiry to look after the animals until the conclusion of the inquiry on a bond"
"by the Magistrate."
"The  petitioners  had  not  intervened  at  the  inquiry.  But  they  had  filed  a  revision"
"application  to  the  High  Court  Claiming  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had"
"followed the wrong procedure in releasing the buffaloes because he had based his"
"order on the two documents produced by the 5 the respondents marked as E2 and"
"E3 which is in contravention of the Animals Act no 29 of 1953 sections 3D 6, 7 and"
"8 (2)."
"The petitioner further cited the gazette dated 26.11.2009 issued by the Minister in"
"charge in which it is stated that a license is needed to transport cattle."
"The learned High Court Judge dismissed the application of the petitioners on the"
"basis that there is delay and the delay is not explained and that the petitioners have"
"no locus standy."
"Being aggrieved by the said orders the instant application has been filed."
"It is well settled law that a party filling a revision application has to do so without"
"delay and if there is it has to be explained. But the Counsel for petitioners urged"
"that it is a technical matter with which the Court should not bother."
"Delay has been considered to be fatal in many of our decided cases and it has been"
"held by this bench that if there is a delay it has to be explained to the satisfaction"
"of Court in CA/PHC/APN 78/2021."
