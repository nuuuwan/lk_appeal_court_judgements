"following grounds of appeal to be considered by the Court."
"1.  According to the indictment, the solicitation of the bribe has been on"
"8th February 2014 and the acceptance on 24th February 2014. The time"
"gap  of  16  days  between  solicitation  and  acceptance  has  created  a"
"reasonable doubt."
"2.  The  solicitation  was  done  on  PW-01  Pradeep  Ranga  and  the  alleged"
"acceptance was from the wife of said Pradeep Ranga which creates a"
"reasonable doubt. The acceptance of the bribe was not by the appellant"
"herself, but through an intermediary who was a peon at the workplace"
"of the husband of the accused, and the place of acceptance creates a"
"reasonable doubt."
"3.  The  money  solicited  was  Rs.  200,000/-,  and  what  was  accepted  was"
"Rs.  150,000/-,  and  the  discrepancy  by  PW-02  and  PW-04  as  to  the"
"denominations of the money has created a reasonable doubt."
