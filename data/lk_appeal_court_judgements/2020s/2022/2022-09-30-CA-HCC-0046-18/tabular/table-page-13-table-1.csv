"cogent and trustworthy. The line of defence taken by the appellant to challenge"
"the solicitation has not created any doubt in that regard."
"The contention of the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel that the prosecution failed to"
"produce the NGO project report which is alleged to have been endorsed by the"
"appellant in order to cover-up what really happened has no merit. It is clear from"
"the evidence that it was to the PW-01 the appellant had handed back the said"
"project report with an assurance that she also can get involved in such a project."
"Therefore,  if  at  all,  the  project  report  should  be  with  PW-01  and  not  with  the"
"appellant. It is obvious as admitted by the PW-01, that since he has not divulged"
"any of these facts in his statement, the investigating officials had no reasons to"
"call for such a report. Similarly, the reasons behind the PW-01 waiting until the"
"21st of February to lodge a complaint has been well explained as no parent would"
"rush to make a complaint of this nature."
"It is my considered view that the prosecution has proved the first and the second"
"count preferred against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt, namely, that she"
"solicited  a  gratification  of  Rs.  200,000/-  from  PW-01  for  the  admission  of  his"
"child to Matale Vijaya College on the date specified in the charge."
"Therefore,  I  find  no  merit  in  the  appeal  in  that  regard,  and  any  reasons  to"
"interfere with the conviction in relation to the first and the second count."
"However,  the  same  cannot  be  said  about  the  conviction  of  the  third  and  the"
"fourth counts preferred against the appellant. The said counts have been on the"
"basis  that  the  appellant  accepted  a  bribe  of  Rs.  150000/-  through  one  Yapa"
"Wijeratne on 24th February 2014."
"No doubt that high degree of suspicion can be directed towards the appellant in"
"view of her solicitation of a bribe as previously discussed. However, it is settled"
"law  that  suspicion  alone  would  not  be  sufficient  to  prove  a  case  beyond"
"reasonable  doubt  against  an  accused  and  it  is  the  duty  of  the  prosecution  to"
"prove its case beyond reasonable doubt."
