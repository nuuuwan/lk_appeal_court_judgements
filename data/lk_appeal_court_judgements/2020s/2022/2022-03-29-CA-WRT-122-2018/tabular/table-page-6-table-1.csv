"Petitioner’s contention that the strike action should be the last resort but the Respondent union"
"had directly resolved to the last weapon in resolving an industrial dispute fails."
"As contended  by the 4th  Respondent’s  Counsel the basic right to strike is an internationally"
"recognized right and it is entrenched in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and"
"Cultural Rights adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 16th December 1966"
"and has been acceded by the Government of Sri Lanka and specifically accepted the right to"
"strike as held in the case of Rubberite Company Ltd Vs. Labour officer Negombo (1990) (2)"
"SLR 142. The 4th Respondent further contended that the strikers had not engaged in any act that"
"violated Section 40(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act and, in any event, the Petitioner had failed"
"to adduce any evidence to substantiate the allegation of such violation before the Arbitrator."
"It was the contention of the 4th  Respondent that in fact, if there had been an illegal strike, the"
"Petitioner should have made an inquiry and a charge sheet issued against the workers. Parties"
"were not at variance that the strikers had gathered outside the premises and staged the strike. The"
"Petitioners strongly contended that this gathering had obstructed the non-striking workforce from"
"entering the premises. However, the Petitioner’s own witness had admitted that the strikers had"
"not obstructed the non-strikers from reporting to work (Page 565 brief)"
"This Court finds that as per P3, the Arbitrator had given due consideration and has come to the"
"conclusion pertaining to the legality of the strike."
"The Petitioner’s next contention was based on sabotage. The Petitioner’s main contention is that"
"the  28 workmen who were members  of the 4th  Respondent  had committed  acts  of sabotage"
"namely   obstructing   the   non-strikers   from   entering   the   company,   damaging   the   boiler   and"
"electrical wiring to machines, and also damaging the vehicles. Further, the Petitioner contended"
"that in this background, ordering reinstatement and granting back wages is illegal."
"However, the 4th Respondent while denying this allegation contended that as stated earlier in this"
"judgment, the Petitioner’s own witness had conceded that there had been no obstruction for the"
"employees to enter into the company and to work. Further, the Petitioner has failed to submit an"
"assessment of damages that are alleged to have been caused by the strikers. In the absence of"
"such material, the 4th  Respondent has successfully created a doubt as to whether in fact if any"
"damages were caused at all. It was also brought to the notice of this Court that three workers had"
"been   charged   in   the   Magistrates   Court   of   Kiribathgoda,   for   damaging   the   properties   of   the"
"company. However, after a comprehensive trial, all three have been acquitted. The Petitioners"
"have not submitted any material to this Court to demonstrate that they have appealed against the"
"decision of the learned Magistrate."
"The Petitioner also contended that the Arbitrator should not have reinstated the workmen as the"
"awarding of reinstatement and back wages was illegal. The Petitioners relied on the case of Best"
