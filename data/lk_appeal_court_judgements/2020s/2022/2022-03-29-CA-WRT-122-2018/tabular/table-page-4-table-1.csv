"The members of the 4th Respondent who were employees of the Petitioner had engaged in strike"
"action after the Petitioner had failed to renew the collective agreement that was in force. The 4 th"
"Respondent had submitted new proposals to be included in a new collective agreement that was"
"mooted to be negotiated. Especially for an increment of salary and other benefits (X6). After"
"several discussions, the parties have failed to agree on the demands and thereby have failed to"
"enter into a new collective agreement. The Petitioner’s contention was that they were not in a"
"position to agree to the new condition that has been forwarded by the 4 th Respondent, especially"
"for   salary   increment   as   the   company   was   not   financially   performing   well.   This   had   been"
"informed to the 4th  Respondent by letter dated 06th  March 2009 (X7). There had been several"
"correspondence and discussions to overcome this disagreement. The Petitioner had submitted"
"alternate   proposals,   especially   a   work   incentive   based   on   the   production.   However,   the   4th"
"Respondent by their letter dated 13th May 2009 had rejected the proposals and had given notice"
"of trade union action by the said letter (X9). Subsequent to this letter the Petitioner alleges that"
"they   have   sought   three   months’   time   from   the   4th  Respondent   to   implement   the   scheme   of"
"incentives based on production (X10)."
"However, 28 workers of the 4th Respondent had engaged in strike action. As the production was"
"falling further the Petitioner had given an ultimatum and informed all employees to report to"
"work by 14th August 2009 (X11).  In reply to this letter the members of the 4 th Respondent had"
"informed that since they were engaged in a trade union action, they were not reporting to work"
"by letter dated 19th August 2009. The Petitioner had issued letters of vacation of post to all the"
"striking workers who were members of the 4th Respondent."
"The said strike action had continued for several months, this dispute had thereafter been referred"
"to an arbitrator under the Industrial Disputes Act. The said industrial arbitration commenced."
"However, before it could conclude the Arbitrator V. I Jayasuriya had passed away, thereafter the"
"dispute had been referred for arbitration under a new arbitrator."
"This  Court will now  consider the terms  of reference  for the said arbitration  which states  as"
"follows;"
"“Whether it is justified by PACKSERVE (PVT LTD) to consider the following 28 employees"
"as having vacated their employment at the company and if not justified to what relief each of"
"them is entitled”."
"Both parties had filed their statements and thereafter evidence had been led. It is pertinent to"
"note that in the statement  filed  by the Petitioners,  they have stated  sabotage by the striking"
"workers and also stated that the strike action of the applicant union is unjustified."
