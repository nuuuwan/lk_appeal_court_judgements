"This Court also observes that nowhere in X11 it is stated that failure to report to work as per X11"
"will result in the Petitioner considering that the members of the 4th Respondent have vacated their"
"post."
"The   Petitioner   also   challenges   the   Arbitrator’s   award,   on   the   ground   that   reinstatement   was"
"illegal and relied on Sec 33 (6) of the Industrial Disputes Act which states as follows,  “the"
"provision of (3) and (5) shall not be construed to limit the power of the industrial Court or an"
"arbitrator, under paragraph (d) of subsection (1), to include in an award a decision as to the"
"payment   of   compensation   as   an   alternate   reinstatement,   in   any   case   where   the   Court   of"
"tribunal thinks fit so to do” Thus, the contention that awarding back wages with reinstatement is"
"wrong."
"The said section is quite clear as it contemplates compensation only as an alternative. Merely"
"because an employer makes an allegation that the industrial relationship with a worker is broken,"
"an arbitrator should not act under the alternative. For the arbitrator to act under the alternative"
"there has to be evidence of a breakdown of the relationship. In this instance, the Arbitrator is"
"given discretion by the statute itself. The arbitrator is the sole judge on the facts and he has used"
"his discretion. The Petitioners have failed to demonstrate to this Court that the Arbitrator has"
"erroneously used his discretion."
"The role of the arbitration is stated in Brown & Company PLC VS Minister of Labour and"
"six   others   2011(1)   SLR   305  it   was   held,   “Arbitration   under   the   Industrial   Disputes   Act   is"
"intended to be even more liberal, informal and flexible than commercial arbitration, primarily"
"because the Arbitrator is empowered to make and award ‘which is just and equitable’.  When an"
"industrial dispute has been referred under Section 3 (1)(d) or Section 4(1) of the Industrial"
"Disputes Act to an Arbitrator for settlement by arbitration, Section 17(1) of the said Act requires"
"such Arbitrator to ‘make all such inquiries into the dispute as he may consider necessary, here"
"such evidence as may be tendered by the parties to the dispute and thereafter make such award"
"as may appear to him just and equitable’.   In my view, the word ’make’ as used in the said"
"provision, has the effect of throwing the ball into the Arbitrator’s Court, so to speak, and requires"
"him to initiate what inquiries he considers are necessary. The Arbitrator is not simply called upon"
"‘to hold an inquiry, where the ball would be in the Court of the parties to the dispute and, it"
"would be left to them to tender what evidence they consider necessary requiring the arbitrator to"
"be just a judge presiding over the inquiry, the control, and progress of which will be in the hands"
"of the parties themselves or their Counsel”"
"It is evident that the Arbitrator has been given the discretion to consider the evidence that is"
