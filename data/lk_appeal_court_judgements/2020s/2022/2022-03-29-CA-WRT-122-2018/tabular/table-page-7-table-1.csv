"facts of the said case in arriving at the decision that the strike is illegal, is different from the facts",""
"of this case. In the said case the Court found that there had been no adequate notice given before",""
"the strike commenced, but in the case, before us, we find as stated elsewhere in this judgment the",""

"demonstrate  that the parties  had engaged in several discussions and several correspondences",""
"have been exchanged before the strike action had commenced. The Petitioner’s contention that as",""
"a result of the strike the company had suffered financial loss thus making the strike illegal cannot",""
"be accepted by this Court as any strike action where production is affected will result in financial",""
"loss to the company. But we are unable to agree that it alone, is a ground to determine that the",""
"strike is illegal unless it is coupled among other grounds with other willful and intentional acts to",""
"purposefully harm the company.",""
"The   next   contention   of   the   Petitioner   is   that   by   the   strike   action,   the   strikers   have   caused",""
"financial loss to the company and that the Petitioner was not capable of paying back wages.",""
"However as quite correctly submitted by the 4th Respondent, in the absence of any justification",""
"pertaining to the termination of the workers, the Petitioner cannot escape his liability by stating",""
"that they are financially not capable of paying back wages. It was also the contention of the",""
"Petitioner   that   the   Arbitrator   has   failed   to   consider   that   the   industrial   relations   between   the",""
"Petitioner company and the 28 workmen had broken down as a result of the strike.",""
"This Court also observes that the Petitioners subsequent to the strike had informed and invited all",""
"the workers back to the workplace. This invitation had been given after the lapse of nearly two",""
"months into the strike (X11). The conduct of the Petitioner himself cuts across his defense of",""
"losing the industrial  relationship  between the worker and the  employer.  If the workers  have",""
"committed   sabotage   which   resulted   in   the   industrial   relations   being   deteriorated,   then   the",""
"Petitioner should have charge-sheeted and taken disciplinary action to justify the termination.",""
"Instead of doing so, the Petitioners had decided to commence work and invite the workers to",""
"report to work. In inviting the workers back to work, the Petitioner has only stated that they have",""
"invited the people to work because the production in the company has gone down. The said letter",""
