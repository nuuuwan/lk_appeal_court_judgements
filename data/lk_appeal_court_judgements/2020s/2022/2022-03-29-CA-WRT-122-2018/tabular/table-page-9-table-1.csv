"has arrived and also has failed to demonstrate that the Arbitrator has not considered the evidence"
"that is present before him in arriving at his final determination"
"If the termination is found to be illegal or cannot be justified the normal relief is reinstatement. In"
"the book “A General Guide to Sri Lankan Labour Law” by Mr. S. Egalahewa at page 695,"
"cited the case of  Ceylon Ceramics Corporation v Weerasinghe SC 24/76, Supreme Court"
"Minutes of 15/70/78 (unrep) it was held that as follows,"
"“The Supreme Court pointed out that except in cases falling within Section 33(3), 33(5) and"
"47(c) of the Industrial Disputes Act, a workman wrongfully dismissed will normally be entitled to"
"reinstatement unless there are special circumstances which justified departure from the general"
"rule.  The Court cited Section 33(6) as fortifying this conclusion and added that the ‘order for"
"payment of compensation is not a matter of course as an alternative to reinstatement in every"
"case; when there is finding that the termination of service is not justified, sufficient reasons"
"should therefore exist to justify a departure from the ordinary relief of reinstatement.’"""
"As the Arbitrator had come to the conclusion that there is no sabotage, especially in view of the"
"acquittals in the Magistrate Court action that has been filed against the strikers. We find that"
"there is no reason for the Arbitrator to apply the alternative in giving relief to the worker. Thus,"
"the Arbitrator’s decision on reinstatement cannot be found fault with."
"At this stage, in considering the Petitioner’s allegation, it is important to consider the reference"
"made   for   an   industrial   arbitration.  The   reference   made   to   the   Arbitrator,   was   to   determine"
"whether Packserve (PVT) Ltd’s decision to consider the 28 employees as having vacated their"
"employment of the company is justified or if not for what relief each of them is entitled to?"
"This Court will now consider the Arbitrator’s decision which is marked as P3."
"The Petitioner’s main argument is that in the decision at P3, the Arbitrator has specifically stated"
"that the Petitioner has failed to file their written submissions at the conclusion of the arbitration."
"By this statement, the Petitioner alleges that the Arbitrator has violated the rules of natural justice"
"and not given a fair hearing to the Petitioner. Both parties are not at variance on the fact that the"
"Petitioners have filed their written submissions which are depicted on page 837 of the brief."
"However, in the P3 order, the Arbitrator has specifically stated that the 4 th Respondent has failed"
"to file the written submissions. Thus, in view of the above statement, it is clear that the Arbitrator"
"in arriving at the decision P3, has failed to consider the written submission of the Petitioner."
"Does it amount to  a  deprivation of the fair hearing  to the Petitioner or as the 4th Respondent’s"
"state whether even if considered, there wouldn’t have been changed in the decision.  This Court"
"will   now   consider   whether   the   omission   to   consider   the   written   submissions   has   materially"
"affected the final determination of the Arbitrator."
