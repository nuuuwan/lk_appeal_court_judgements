"As per Section 17 (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, when an industrial dispute is referred, it is"
"incumbent   on   the   arbitrator   to   make   all   such   inquiries   into   the   dispute   as   he   may   consider"
"necessary, hear all evidence that may be tendered by the parties to the dispute and make an"
"award as may appear to him just and equitable. The Petitioner has failed to demonstrate before"
"this Court that the Arbitrator has failed to consider the evidence, nor did he make any allegations"
"that the Arbitrator had failed to make all such inquiries into the dispute. Their main grievance"
"was the Arbitrator’s failure to consider the written submission that had been filed. However, we"
"are mindful of the fact that the written submissions are not considered as evidence."
"This Court observes that the role of an arbitrator in adjudicating an industrial dispute arbitration"
"is clearly explained in  “A General Guide to Sri Lanka Labour Law” page 171  by Mr. S."
"Egalahewa, where he has stated as follows, “An employer in proceedings before an arbitrator"
"has no burden to discharge in relation to a dismissal of a workman by him and a workman has"
"no burden to discharge in respect of showing that the termination is wrongful. The burden is on"
"the arbitrator to make all such inquiries and make a just and equitable order… the duty of the"
"arbitrator is to look for the material and the circumstances surrounding the employment of the"
"workman and her termination. He can elicit this material in any manner he wants subject only to"
"the rules of natural justice.”"
"The Petitioner contends  that when the Arbitrator gave the order P3, without considering the"
"written submission of the Petitioner, he has violated the rules of natural justice i.e. the Petitioner"
"has not been afforded a fair hearing. This Court cannot agree on this contention as the Petitioner"
"has appeared in the arbitration, with legal representation. The Petitioner has cross-examined the"
"witnesses of the 4th  Respondent Union and also, on behalf of the Petitioner, several witnesses"
"have testified. We also had the opportunity of observing the Petitioner’s written submissions."
"Curiously the said written submission is dated 12th  May 2016. However, there is a date stamp"
"from the Industrial Courts which states the date as 27th June 2016. In the said written submission,"
"the Petitioner has invited the arbitral tribunal to consider whether the strike is illegal but mainly"
"has focused on the evidence led before the Arbitrator. Other than this reference, inviting the"
"Arbitrator to ascertain the legality of the strike, the written submission is a re-production of the"
"evidence that has been led before the Arbitrator. In our view, the Arbitrator has considered all the"
"evidence and upon making necessary inquiries pertaining to the legality of the strike has come to"
"a conclusion."
"In   this   context,   this   Court   will   now   consider   whether   by   not   considering   the   said   written"
"submission, the Petitioner had been prejudiced. This Court observes that by P3, the Arbitrator"
"had considered all the evidence that has been led before him and also evaluated the evidence."
"The Arbitrator has considered the evidence of one Vijitha Kumara pertaining to the sabotage"
"charges that have been filed against three members of the 4th Respondent Union and also the fact"
"that after a protracted trial the accused had been discharged. The Arbitrator had considered the"
"allegation of the sabotage of the machines. In his order, he has stated,"
