"The  PW-09  has  been  fifteen  years  of  age  at  the  time  of  the  incident  and  has"
"given evidence in the Court fifteen years after the event. The way he has given"
"evidence,  even  after  he  was  treated  as  an  adverse  witness  for  the  prosecution"
"and  questioned,  clearly  shows  that  he  has  forgotten,  more  than  trying  to  give"
"false  evidence,  as  to  some  of  the  details  of  what  happened  on  that  night.  The"
"way  most  of  the  other  witnesses  have  given  evidence  too,  who  were  of  similar"
"age  at  the  time  of  the  incident,  shows  that  they  have  forgotten  and  given"
"evidence by taking time to remember things that happened so unexpectedly to"
"them on that night."
"In this matter, it was not the treating of the witness as an adverse witness to"
"the prosecution, but what happened thereafter that has caused the denial of a"
"fair trial towards the appellant."
"After the conclusion of the evidence-in chief of PW-09 by the prosecution and"
"before he was subjected to the cross examination by the defence, he has been"
"ordered  to  be  remanded  on  the  basis  that  steps  would  be  taken  to  prosecute"
"him for giving false evidence in the Court. After he was so remanded on 04-07-"
"2018,  he  was  continuously  kept  in  remand  until  the  pronouncement  of  the"
"judgment  of  this  case  on  14-12-2018  and  released  on  bail  thereafter.  He  has"
"also  been  produced  in  every  postponed  date  of  the  trial  from  the  remand"
"custody  along  with  the  accused,  which  appears  to  be  a  warning  for  the  other"
"witnesses to see."
"The learned trial judge has observed on several occasions during the testimony"
"of PW-09 as well as other witnesses who gave evidence thereafter that they are"
"pausing  and  thinking  before  answering  the  questions.  Commenting  on  one  of"
"the  witnesses,  it  has  been  stated  that  he  is  blinking  his  eyes  faster  while"
"answering  the  questions,  although  thinking  behind  such  observations  is  not"
"clear."
