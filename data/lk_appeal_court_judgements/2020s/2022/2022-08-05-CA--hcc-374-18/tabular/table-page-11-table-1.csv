"Be  that  as  it  may,  I  would  now  like  to  draw  the  attention  of  the  learned"
"Attorney General to the plight of the witness No-09 may be enduring since his"
"release on bail. He has been ordered Rs.10000/- cash bail with a directive that"
"he should personally deposit that amount. In addition, he has been ordered Rs."
"100000/-  surety  bail,  with  the  conditions  that  the  surety  should  be  a  close"
"relative,  with  a  Grama  Sevaka  report  on  his  residency,  another  report  to"
"establish  that  the  surety  has  sufficient  assets.  The  surety  has  also  been"
"required  to  produce  a  police  clearance  report  to  establish  that  he  has  no"
"previous  or  pending  cases.  The  witness  has  also  been  required  to  produce  a"
"certificate  to  prove  his  residency  before  he  is  allowed  bail,  and  has  prevented"

"any detrimental effect that will be on any potential witnesses in criminal cases,"
"where the witnesses will be very much reluctant or will not come forward  and"

"Having said that, I will now turn my attention to the argument that the learned"
"High  Court  Judge  was  misdirected  as  to  the  relevant  law  in  relation  to  the"
"defence of alibi put forward by the appellant."
"It is abundantly clear that the learned High Court Judge has gone on the basis"
"that it is the appellant who has to prove his defence of alibi by establishing that"
