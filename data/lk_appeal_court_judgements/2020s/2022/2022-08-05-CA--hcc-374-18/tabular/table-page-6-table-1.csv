"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  was  critical  of  the  procedure  that  has  been"
"adopted  after  treating  the  PW-09  as  an  adverse  witness  for  the  prosecution,"
"where  the  said  witness  was  kept  in  remand  until  the  conclusion  of  the  trial."
"Citing several judgments of our Superior Courts, it was his view that this has"
"clearly led to a situation where fair trial has been denied to the appellant."
"It  was  pointed  out  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  was  totally  misdirected"
"on the relevant legal principles as to the appellant’s defence of alibi, where the"
"burden of proof had been shifted to the appellant."
"It  was  his  argument  that  the  above  two  matters  alone  have  the  effect  of"
"vitiating  the  conviction  of  the  appellant.  Moreover,  it  was  contended  that  the"
"procedure  adopted  before  the  deposition  of  the  PW-01  was  led  in  terms  of"
"section  33  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  was  also  faulty.  It  was  pointed  out  that"
"the evidence to establish that the witness is not available to give evidence has"
"been led some years before his deposition was marked at the trial."
"In the alternative, it was his view that this was a case where the learned High"
"Court Judge should have considered whether there was evidence of provocation"
"given the facts and the circumstances, even if no such defence has been set up"
"by the appellant."
"After giving careful thought to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant"
"and the cases cited, the learned Additional Solicitor General (ASG) on behalf of"
"the Attorney General agreed that he is in no position to defend the  procedure"
"adopted  in  remanding  PW-09  on  the  basis  that  he  has  given  false  evidence,"
"which  would  have  had  a  detrimental  effect  on  the  other  witnesses.  He  agreed"
"that the learned High Court Judge has clearly shifted the burden of proof to the"
"appellant on his defence of alibi, which is untenable in law."
"It was also his view that it would have been better to lead evidence in terms of"
"section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance, when it becomes necessary to establish"
"that the presence of a witness cannot be secured  without an amount of delay"
