"1998/1999  could  be  deducted  from  the  total  statutory  income  as  that"
"amount of the loss could have been assessed under the Act if it had been"
"a profit.‚Äù"
"[58] The learned Senior State Counsel who, however, relied on the decision of"
"this  Court  in  Royal  Ceramics  v.  Commissioner-General  of  Inland  Revenue"
"(supra) and submitted that for Section 32 (5) (a) of the Inland Revenue Act to"
"apply, it must be assumed that the Appellant made profits in the following year,"
"and therefore, the losses are permitted to be deducted in the following year on"
"the assumption that the loss, if it had been a profit, would be taxable."
"[59] In Royal Ceramics v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra),"
"the Appellant incurred trade losses for the years of assessment 1993/1994 and"
"1994/1995 but earned interest income for the same period and deducted the"
"trade losses from the income earned from interest. The Assessor rejected the"
"return by disallowing the trade losses deducted from the interest income from"
"fixed deposits as not being in accordance with section 29 (2) (b) of the Inland"
"Revenue Act, 1979 and issued assessments."
"[60] The issue was whether the Appellant was entitled, in terms of Section 29"
"(2) (b) of the Inland Revenue Act, 1979 to deduct trade losses from the interest"
"income  from  fixed  losses  incurred  for  the  year  of  assessment  1993/94  and"

"the payment of income tax in terms of section 17C (1) of the Inland Revenue"
"Act, 1979. Section 17C (1) permitted the profits and income of any company"
"to be exempt from  income tax for a period of 5 years reckoned from the year"
"of assessment in which such company commenced to make profits in respect"
"of its transactions in that year."
"[61]  On  the  other  hand,  Section  29  (2)  (b)  allowed  the  deduction  of  a  loss"
"incurred by a person from its total statutory income for any year of assessment,"
"which,  if  it  had  been  a  profit  would  have  been  assessable  under  the  Inland"
"Revenue Act, 1979 or the Inland Revenue Act, No. 4 of 1963, and which has"
"not been allowed against his statutory income of a previous year under these"
"Acts."
"[62] The Court of Appeal decided that although the Appellant commenced to"
"make  profits  in  the  year  of  assessment  1996/97,  the  years  of  assessment"
"relevant  to  the  matter  were  1993/94  and  1994/95  and  for  the  application  of"
