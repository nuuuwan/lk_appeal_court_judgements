"[38] At the hearing Mr. Goonewardene submitted that in addition to the said two",""
"rules referred to in Clause 12 (i), the Appellant had to satisfy certain additional",""
"preconditions set out in Clause 7 of the BOI Agreement, and therefore, even if",""
"the Appellant had made a profit in the year 2008/2009, the Appellant would not",""
"be entitled to tax exemption under the BOI Agreement unless the Appellant was",""
"able  to  satisfy  the  investment  criteria  set  out  in  Clause  7.  Accordingly,  he",""
"submitted  that  the  Respondentâ€™s  contention  that  as  the  Appellant  had  made",""
"taxable  profits  during  the  year  of  assessment  2008/2009,  the  tax  exemption",""

"[39] The learned Senior State Counsel conceded that additionally, the BOI must",""

fulfilled  by 
the  Appellant  after","the  commencement  of

"[40] Her submission was that as no assumption can be made on the basis of",""
"the letter dated 07.01.2011 issued by the BOI, the question whether the loss",""
"claimed by the Appellant can be considered as a profit within the period of the",""
"commercial operations and that it was a loss brought forward from the previous",""
"year 2008/2009 to the year of assessment 2009/2010 for tax exemption under",""

"[41] A perusal of the appeal determined by the Commissioner-General further",""

that
