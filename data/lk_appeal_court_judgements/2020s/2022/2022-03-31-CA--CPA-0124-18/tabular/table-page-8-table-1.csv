"In the impugned order dated 23.07.2018, the learned High Court Judge"
"rejects the contention that in the event access has not been granted by the"
"expiration  of  15  days  since  Section  7(1)(b)  notice,  the  proposing  party"
"under Section 7 (1) (a) is estopped from leading the special evidence. The"
"said order refers to stipulation of ‘reasonable time period’ within Section 7"
"of the Act as recognition of the practical difficulties in implementing the"
"provision  by  the  legislature.  The  learned  High  Court  judge  refuses  to"
"employ a strict interpretation of the time bar envisioned in Section 7 (1) (c)"
"of the Act and opines that if the converse is expected, the petitioner should"
"have specified the modalities of the access requested.  The learned High"
"Court  Judge  in  conclusion  pronounced  the  following  and  ordered  the"
"matter to be called on 29.08.2018."
