"Statutes, 10th Edition, Page 47 and Page 58.)  It is an elementary rule that"
"construction is to be made of all the parts together, and not of one part"
"only by itself. It is clearly resolved in Canada Sugar Refining Co, Ltd vs"
"R [1898] A.C.735 ‘Every clause of a statue is to be construed with reference"
"to the context and other clauses of the Act, so as, as far as possible, to make"
"a consistent of the whole statute’.   Further in, Midland Bank vs Conway"
"B.C. [1965] 1 W.L.R. 1165 states ‘a case in which the principle that word"
"should be read in their context prevailed over argument based on the literal"
"wording of the Act and the purpose of the provision in question."
"Now  to  the 
facts.  As  referred  to  above,  the  respondent 
invoked  the"
"provisions  of  Section  7(1)(a)  by  giving  notice 
to 
the  petitioner  on"
"12.06.2018. The petitioner, relying on Section 7(1)(b) issued notices to the"
"respondent on 18.06.2018. On 09.07.2018, as evinced by Page 38 of the"
"Brief, the petitioner raised an objection to prevent the leading of computer"
"evidence  as  proposed  by  the  respondent,  stating  that  by  virtue  of  the"
"respondent’s  non-compliance  to  the  time  period  stipulated  in  Section"
"7(1)(c)  of  the  Act,  the  respondent  can  no  longer  rely  on  such  computer"
"evidence when the trial begins. This objection was premised on the basis"
"that  by  virtue  of  noncompliance, 
the 
respondent  has  violated 
the"
"mandatory requirement of the stipulated 15 days, reasonable time period"
"as provided for in Section 7 (1) (c) of the Act, thus frustrating the law and"
"negating the intention of the legislature.  Thereafter the impugned order"
"dated  23.07.2018  was  delivered  by 
the 
learned  High  Court  Judge,"
"overruling  the  said  objection  and  directing  the  parties  to  come  into  an"
"agreement in order to facilitate access to the proposed computer evidence."
