"Upon the service of the indictment the Counsel for  the accused had made an"
"application  for  bail  but  it  had  been  refused  on  the  basis  that  in  view  of  the"
"quantity  of  the  heroin  bail  can  be  considered  once  the  main  witnesses  of  the"
"prosecution are over."
"The Counsel appearing for the Respondents objected to the instant application"
"on the basis of lack of exceptional circumstances."
"The  law  pertaining  to  the  instant  application  is  that  if  a  person  is  indicted  or"
"arrested under the provisions of the above mentioned act bail can be considered"
"only upon exceptional circumstances, but the statute has not defined the term"
"exceptional. But the cases so far decided has defined exceptional circumstances"
"to be decided on facts of each case, and this has been very clearly stated in the"
"case of Ramu Thamodarumpillai vs. The Attorney General, although it is case"
"after the trial pending the appeal."
"The  instant  matter  is  during  trial  hence  the  most  important  aspect  here  is  to"
"make  sure  that  the  accused  appears  to  face  the  trial  hence  the  likelihood  of"
"absconding is lesser than when considering bail pending the appeal."
"The main contention of the Counsel for the accused is that the instant case is a"
"fabrication by the prosecution witnesses but as stated in the recently decided"
"case  in  the  Supreme  Court  53-2022  that  “creditworthiness  of  witnesses  and"
"morality cannot be considered in a bail application under the above mentioned"
"act”., but this Court observes that the learned High Court Judge had stated that"
"bail  would  be  considered  upon  the  conclusion  of  the  main  witnesses  of  the"
"prosecution,  hence  we  direct  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  to  expedite  this"
"matter  and  consider  bail  upon  the  conclusion  of  the  main  witness  of  the"
"prosecution as per his order dated 1.4.2022."
