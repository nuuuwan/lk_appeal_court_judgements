"surmised  that  there  is  no  significant  delay  in  hearing  the  petitioner’s"
"appeal amounting to an exceptional circumstance."
"It is pertinent at this point to also note the proviso to Article 138(1) of the"
"Constitution:"
"“Provided  that no judgement, decree or order of any court shall be"
"reversed  or  varied  on  account  of  any  error,  defect  or  irregularity,"
"which  has  not  prejudiced  the  substantial  rights  of  the  parties  or"
"occasioned a failure of justice.”"
"In  light  of  the  above,  it  is  the  considered  opinion  of  this  Court  that  the"
"petitioner has failed to establish exceptional circumstances which justifies"
"the  invocation  of  the  discretionary  revisionary  jurisdiction  of  this  Court."
"The petitioner has not been able to establish that, as Per Article 138 of the"
"Constitution that his substantial rights have been prejudiced, nor that the"
"impugned order of the learned High Court Judge is manifestly erroneous"
"so as to occasion a failure of justice. Thus, the petitioner has not been able"
"to establish how the impugned order is a miscarriage of justice that shocks"
"the conscience of the Court."
"Application is dismissed."
