in  a"
"","public place."
"6.","The grounds of appeal no.1 and no.2 will be discussed"
"","together as they are based on the same footing."
"","The  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted  that,"
"","the prosecution has failed to prove the dates on which"
"","the victim was sexually abused. Upon being questioned"
"","with  regard  to  the  days  on  which  he  was  abused,  the"
"","PW1 
in  his  evidence  has 
replied 
that,  he  cannot"
"","remember 
the 
exact 
dates. 
The 
learned  Deputy"
"","Solicitor  General  submitted  that,  although  the  victim"
"","could  not  remember  the  exact  dates  on  which  he  was"
"","abused, 
there 
is  ample  evidence 
to  show 
that 
the"
"","victim  has  been  abused  by  the  appellant  on  several"
"","occasions within the period specified in the charge."
"7.","The  learned  High  Court  Judge  in  her  judgment  has"
"","sufficiently discussed this issue from page 15 onwards"
"","(page  165  of 
the  appeal  brief).  According 
to 
the"
"","evidence as analysed by the learned High Court Judge,"
"","the  PW1  has  clearly  stated 
that,  he  was  sexually"
"","abused  on  several  occasions  within  a  period  of  one"
"","year  before  his  statement  was  recorded.  According  to"
"","counts no.1 and no.2 in the indictment, it was alleged"
"","that  the  victim  was abused  during the period  between"
"","24th  September  2012  and  8th  August  2013.  Thus,  the"
"","victim  has  in  fact  clearly  said  in  his  evidence  that,  he"
"","was  sexually  abused  on  several  occasions  by 
the"
"","appellant  within  a  period  of  one  year  before  his"
"","statement was recorded by the police. As discussed in"
"","her judgment by the learned High Court Judge, what is"
"","of importance is whether the accused sexually abused"
"","the child."
"8.","This 
issue 
was 
aptly 
discussed 
in 
case

"","General CA/194/2015 [07/05/2019] it was held that,"
