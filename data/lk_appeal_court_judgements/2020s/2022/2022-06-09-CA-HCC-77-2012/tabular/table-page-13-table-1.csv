"T
he  defence  of  the  first  appellant  in  his  evidence  said  that    he  was  never"
"present  at  the  scene  of  the  murder.  This  was  not  put  to  PW1  or  any  other"
"witnesses.    The  second  appellant  in  his  dock  statement  took  up  the  position"
"that he was at his home when this murder took place. The defence of alibi was"
"also not put to PW1 or to other witnesses by the defence."
"In the case of Gunasiri and two others vs Republic of Sri Lanka 2009 1 SRI LR"
"39, Sisira de Abrew J held as follows:"
"""Although the 3rd accused-appellant raised an alibi in his dock statement, he"
"failed  to  suggest  this  position  to  prosecution  witnesses.  The  learned  Counsel"
"who appeared for the defence did not suggest to the prosecution witnesses the"
"alibi raised by the 3rd accused-appellant. What is the effect of such silence on"
"the  part  of  the  Counsel.  In  this  connection,  I  would  like  to  consider  certain"
"judicial  decisions.  In  the  case  of  Sarwan  Singh  vs.  State  of  Punjab  at  3656"
"Indian Supreme Court held thus: ""It is a rule of essential justice that whenever"
"the opponent has declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in"
"cross  examination  it  must  follow  that  the  evidence  tendered  on  that  issue"
"ought to be accepted. â€œThis judgment was cited with approval in Bobby Mathew"
"vs.  State  of  Kamatakal  5)    Applying  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  above"
"judicial  decision,  I  may  express  the  following  view.  Failure  to  suggest  the"
"defence  of  alibi  to  the  prosecution  witnesses  who  implicated  the  accused,"
"indicates  that  it  was  a  false  one.  Considering  all  these  matters  I  am  of  the"
"opinion that the defence of alibi raised by the 3rd accused-appellant is an after"
"thought."""
"In the instant case, the failure to suggest the defence of alibi to the prosecution"
"witnesses indicates that this is an afterthought."
"The defence of alibi should cover the time of the alleged offence so as to exclude"
"the presence of the accused, at the crime scene at the relevant time."
