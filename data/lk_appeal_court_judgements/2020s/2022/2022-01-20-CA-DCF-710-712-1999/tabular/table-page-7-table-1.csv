"It was stated in the appeal number CA 711/99 at paragraph 2 of the petition of appeal by the"
"1st and 21st defendant-appellants that the land sought to be partitioned is correctly depicted"
"in plan marked as ""X"" and in any event, lot 8 in plan number 1089 or 3/D/2 is a separate land"
"called  1/7th  portion  of  ‘Millagahawatte’  and  lots  5,  6  and  7  were  also  another  land  called"
"‘Delgaha-Landa’. In paragraph 7 they further stated that according to the judgment no shares"
"were allotted to the 1st defendant and he was only entitled to compensation of the rubber"
"plantation. The 21st defendant was also not given anything by the learned trial Judge. They"
"stated that the judgment is contrary to law and against the weight of the evidence led in the"
"case. Not only that, it was further stated that the conclusion of the Judge is also erroneous."
"The learned District Judge has drawn his attention to the evidence led by the 01st defendant-"
"appellant and that the deed produced in the District Court did not apply to any part of what"
"is depicted in the plan 3/D/2 or the plan number 1089. The 1st and 21st defendant-appellants’"
"version is that the learned District Judge had erred in including lots 5, 6, 7 and 8 of plan 1089"
"or document marked 3/D/2 in the corpus to be partitioned. They have not asked for a re-trial"
"and have prayed mainly to set aside the judgment. Therefore, they cannot find any relief from"
"this Court, in this appeal."
"The 1st and 21st defendant-appellants have marked and produced 6 deeds. They are 1/D/2,"
"1/D/3, 1/D/4, 1/D/5, 1/D/6 and 1/D/7. Out of these 6 deeds, the 1st defendant does not know"
"what is the land given to him by the donor, the earlier owner Abraham. Even the donor does"
"not state about the land and does not specify the allotment."
"The evidence in page 645 of the appeal brief is as follows;"
"Evidence in chief (Proceedings on 18.01.1989)"
