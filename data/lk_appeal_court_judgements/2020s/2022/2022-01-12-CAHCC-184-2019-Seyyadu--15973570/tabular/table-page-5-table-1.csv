"person  at  the  crime  scene  or  around  that  time.  Hence,  the  first  ground  of"
"appeal should necessarily fail."
"12. It was submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant, that the failure of"
"the prosecution to call the wife of the deceased who alarmed the others by"
"shouting  as  testified  by  the  witnesses  for  the  prosecution,  should  be  taken"
"against 
the  prosecution 
in 
terms  of  section  114 
illustration  (f)  of 
the"
"Evidence  Ordinance.  It  is  the  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  that  the"
"prosecution  did  not 
call 
the  wife  of 
the  deceased 
as 
it  would  be"
"unfavourable to the prosecution if they called her to testify."
"13. In terms of section 120 of the Evidence Ordinance, wife of the appellant is"
"not a competent  witness in the instant case to testify against  the appellant."
"However, she is a competent witness if called by the appellant. This is not a"
"case  against  the  appellant  for  causing  injury  or  violence  against  his  wife."
"Thus, the 2nd ground of appeal is devoid of merit."
"1
4. Hence, 
the 
judgment  of 
the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  convicting 
the"
"appellant on all four counts in the indictment and the subsequent sentences"
"imposed are affirmed."
"Appeal dismissed."
