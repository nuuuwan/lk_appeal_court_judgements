"The  subsequent  conduct  of  the  3rd  and  4th  Appellants,  which  was  the  3rd"
"Appellant giving the keys to the van to PW2 and the 4th Appellant lying to"
"PW2 that the van belonged to his boss, clearly shows that they were privy to"
"the crime committed."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  considered  all  these  matters  in  his"
"judgment  and  correctly  concluded  that  they  were  guilty  of  the  respective"
"charges  levelled  against  them.  Hence,  the  grounds  considered  above  also"
"have no merit."
"In  the  final  ground  of  appeal,  the  Learned  Counsel  for  the  1st  and  2nd"
"Appellants contends that the learned High Court Judge had failed to give the"
"benefit of the doubt of the prosecution case to the 1st and 2nd Appellants."
"The learned High Court Judge had considered all the evidence presented by"
"both  parties  to  arrive  at  his  conclusion.  He  has  properly  analysed  the"
"evidence in keeping with the standard of proof in a criminal trial and arrived"

"though he had stated in his dock statement that he had gone to the estate"
"with two other persons for the purposes of carrying out his clothes business,"
"had  taken  two  different  stances  when  divulging  his  reasons  for  the  visit."
"According  to  PW1  the  4th  Appellant  had  said  that  he  came  to  transport  a"
"person who was willing to go abroad. But to PW2, he had said that he was"
"going to bring a van back to Colombo from Hatton. Further the 4th Appellant"
"had told PW2 that the van was belonging to his boss.  The learned High Court"
"Judge has considered all the evidence presented before him by both parties"
"to decide this case. He has provided proper reasoning as to why he accepts"
