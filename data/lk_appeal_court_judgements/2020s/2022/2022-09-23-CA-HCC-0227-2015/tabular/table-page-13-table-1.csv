"the 5th accused had been taken into custody by the Maradana Police. As none"
"of the persons who had allegedly participated at this surreptitious burial of"
"the dead body were taken into custody by the Maradana police, the Counsel"
"argues that receiving knowledge about the place of burial by the Maradana"
