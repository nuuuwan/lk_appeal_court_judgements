"correctly  relied  on  the  evidence  of  the  prosecution  and  convicted  the"

"In the circumstances, I am of the view as there are no merit in the appeals"
"of the Appellants and therefore their appeals ought to be dismissed.   Hence,"
"I affirm the conviction and sentence of the Appellants and proceed to dismiss"
"their appeals."
