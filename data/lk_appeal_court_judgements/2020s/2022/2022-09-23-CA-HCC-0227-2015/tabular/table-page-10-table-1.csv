"Appellant had held the trunk of the deceased from the legs (thighs) by one"
"hand as he was carrying a torch by the other hand and dug a pit of 2x3x3"
"feet (approximately) by using a mamoty with a blade of 3 Â½ x 4 inches within"
"an approximate period of one hour and buried the dead body."
"1st  Appellant  (even  though  he  was  a  Kankani)  and  2nd  Appellant  are  well"
"experienced labourers working in the estate. Digging and soil preparation are"
"daily  routine  work  done  in  an  estate.  Hence,  the  conduct  of  1st  and  2nd"
"Appellants with regard to carrying the dead body, digging a pit and burial of"
"the corpse cannot be considered as improbable events in this case. According"
"to PW1 the dead body was carried by both of them to the ditch."
"The Learned Counsel for the 1st ,2nd and 3rd Appellants argued that there is"
"an inter-se contradiction existing between the evidence of PW1 and that of"
"the doctor and the investigating officer in  relation to the manner  in which"
"the corpse was buried."
"According to PW1, it was only the two legs severed from the torso that were"
"put inside the urea bag before the burial and the trunk of the deceased was"
"put into the pit first and the urea bag containing the severed legs was put"
"over the trunk thereafter. However, as per the evidence given by the doctor-"
"PW8 and the investigating officer-PW6, at the time of the recovery the entire"
"body of the deceased including the trunk and two severed legs were found"
"inside the same urea bag. Further, the said urea bag was tied with a cord"
"when it was recovered from where it was buried."
"PW1  under  cross  examination  stated  that  he  was  holding  the  burning"
"handmade  torch  (Pandama)  when  the  burial  was  done  by  the  1st  and  2nd"
"Appellants. When the body was taken down to the place where it was buried,"
"he had dropped the handmade torch. For this the 1st and 2nd Appellants had"
"said that he too should be buried. Thereafter he had remained silent until"
"the burial was over."
