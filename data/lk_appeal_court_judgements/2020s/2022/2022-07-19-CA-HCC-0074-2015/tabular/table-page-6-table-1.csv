"It was the submission of the learned Counsel that the admission by the witnesses"
"that  the  suspects  were  shown  to  them  before  the  identification  parade  was  a"
"matter  that  goes  into  the  root  of  the  action  which  creates  a  doubt  as  to  the"
"identification of the accused."

"learned Counsel that the infirmities in the evidence of the said witnesses have"
"not  been  considered  by  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  and  had  that  been"
"considered in the correct perspective, there was sufficient basis to conclude that"
"a reasonable doubt has been created as to the culpability of the appellant to the"
"crime, which should have been considered in favour of him. It was her contention"
"that the appeal of the appellant should succeed as the prosecution has failed to"

"is devoid of any merit."
