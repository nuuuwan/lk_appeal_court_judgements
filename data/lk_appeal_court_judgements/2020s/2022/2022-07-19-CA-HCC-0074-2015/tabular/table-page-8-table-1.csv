"occurred,  has  taken  steps  to  record  a  statement  from  the  appellant  in  that"
"regard, while he was in the prison custody. After he being named as a suspect,"
"the police have taken due steps to file further reports before the  Magistrate of"
"Walasmulla  and  to  hold  a  due  identification  parade  through  the  Magistrate,"
"where PW-02 and PW-03 has identified the appellant as one of the two persons"
"who assaulted the deceased Susantha."
"Although PW-12 who has recorded a further statement from the appellant has"
"stated in his evidence that he recorded the statement at the Walasmulla police"
"station,  the  original  non-summary  case  record  of  the  Walasmulla  Magistrate"
"Court which is available before this Court provides that it was not so,  and he"
"has  given  wrong  evidence,  which  the  prosecuting  State  Counsel  has  failed  to"
"notice or correct. It is clear from the Magistrate Court record that the appellant"
"has never been released after his arrest on suspicion by the Beliatta police and"
"remanded. By the further B report filed by the OIC of Beliatta police on 04-05-"
"2003, he has requested the Magistrate to hold an identification parade in relation"
"to the appellant, who was in remand custody by then for identification parades"
"for  several  other  cases  as  a  suspect.  This  goes  on  to  show  that  the  witnesses"
"have  had  no  opportunity  of  seeing  him  before  the  parade  at  any  of  the  police"
"stations."
"I find no basis whatsoever for the claim of the learned Counsel for the appellant"
"that he was detained unlawfully and it has denied him a fair trial, since he has"
"been duly produced within the legally stipulated period before a competent Court"
"after his arrest as a suspect, and remanded to proper legal custody."
"In view of the admission by the eye witnesses that some persons were shown to"
"them at the Walasmulla police station and they identified the third accused at"
"the police station and never saw the appellant before the identification parade it"
"becomes  necessary  to  consider  whether  the  witnesses  had  an  opportunity  of"
"seeing the appellant as well, before the identification parade was held."
