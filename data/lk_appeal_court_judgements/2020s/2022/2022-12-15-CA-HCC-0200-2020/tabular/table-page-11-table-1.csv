"believed  was  such  that  it  caused  the  jury  to  entertain  a  reasonable"
"doubt in regard to his guilt."
"The position maintained right throughout by the appellant had been that he was"
"never arrested  in the place mentioned by the witnesses and in the  manner, it"
"was  mentioned.  His  position  had  been  that  he  was  arrested  while  at  home  in"
"Ragama and when the excise officers could not find any heroin in his possession"
"or in his house, the heroin was introduced to him because he could not adhere"
"to the demands made by the officers."
"In  my  view,  it  is  therefore  necessary  for  the  prosecution  to  establish  beyond"
"reasonable doubt that the detection was made in the manner it was stated and"
"at the place of the detection. When considering the probability factor of the way"
"the informant has allegedly had behaved just before the arrest of the appellant"
"and the discrepancies in the evidence of PW-09 and PW-07, as I have considered"
"earlier, I am of the view that this was not a conviction that can be considered"
"safe."
"Therefore, giving the benefit of the doubt in the appellantâ€™s favour, I set aside the"
"conviction and the sentence, and acquit the appellant of the charges preferred"
"against him for the reasons considered as above."
"The appeal is allowed."
