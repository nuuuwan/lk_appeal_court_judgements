"I am not in a position to agree with the learned High Court Judgeâ€™s determination"
"that  there  was  no  contradiction  in  the  two  positions.  The  learned  High  Court"
"Judge  has  determined  that  what  was  said  by  PW-09  that  he  escorted  the"
"appellant  to  the  behind  of  the  communication  shop  means  that  he  has  taken"
"him inside of the communication shop and to the rear side of the inside of it. I"
"find that if one looks at the evidence of the relevant witnesses in its totality, there"
"was no basis to come to such a conclusion. I am of the view that there was a"
"clear contradiction between the version of events by the two witnesses."
"The next matter brought to the notice of the Court by the learned Counsel for"
"the  appellant  was  that  there  was  a  contradiction  as  to  the  cellophane  bag"
"allegedly found in the possession of the appellant.  He  referred  to the evidence"
"where PW-09 says a small cellophane bag was recovered with a tightened top in"
"the possession of the appellant. This is the bag that has been marked as P-2 at"
"the trial. It has been brought to the notice of the trial Court that in fact P-2 was"
"not a small bag, but a part of a cellophane bag that has been cut out of a corner"
"of  a  larger  bag.  I  do  not  find  any  material  contradiction  in  that  regard  as  the"
"witness has explained later what he meant by a small cellophane bag and as to"
"why he did not make notes that when found it had a knot."
"However, I am of the view that the earlier mentioned probability factor and the"
"discrepancies and contradictions are material that goes into the credibility of the"
"evidence of the witnesses, which should have been looked in the favour of the"
"appellant."
"It was held in the case of Alim Vs. Wijesinghe (S.I. Police, Batticaloa) 38 CLW"
"95 that; Where the same facts are capable of inference in favour of the accused"
"and also of an inference against him, the inference consistent with his innocence"
"should be preferred."
"Needless to say, that the two witnesses are Excise Department officials who are"
"trained  in  conducting  this  type  of  raids  and  knowledgeable  of  the  way  they"
"should  give  evidence  before  a  Court  in  that  regard.  They  have  the  added"
