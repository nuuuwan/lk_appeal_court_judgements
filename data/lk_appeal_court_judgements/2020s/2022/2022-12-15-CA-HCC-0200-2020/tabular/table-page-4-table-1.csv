"communication shop. Upon searching the appellant, he has found a parcel in a"
"cellophane cover in the possession of the appellant. Upon inspecting further, he"
"has found a brown-coloured powder inside the cover, which he has identified as"
"heroin through his experience."
"Upon this detection, PW-09 has arrested the appellant around 7.55 p.m. He has"
"then informed his superior officer who was in the vehicle they were travelling to"
"come near the place of arrest. After taking the appellant and the heroin recovered"
"to  the  vehicle,  he  has  taken  steps  to  temporarily  seal  the  production.  The"
"contents had been weighed at the Excise Station, and it has been found that the"
"appellant was in possession of 4800 milligrams of heroin. Thereafter, PW-09 has"
"taken the usual steps to seal the productions and later hand it over to the Court."
"According to the Government Analyst Report, the quantity of the substance sent"
"to them for analysis had contained 2.37 grams of pure heroin."
"PW-07 Excise Guard 990 Sisira, who was the officer who assisted PW-09 in this"
"detection  has  given  evidence  to  corroborate  the  version  of  events  as  stated  by"
"PW-09."
"The  stand  taken  up  by  the  appellant  at  the  trial  had  been  that  he  was  never"
"arrested in the manner the prosecution witnesses are narrating, but arrested at"
"his home in Ragama. He has maintained that he had no heroin in his possession"
"at that time."
"When  called  for  a  defence  at  the  conclusion  of  the  prosecution  evidence,  the"
"appellant has chosen to make a statement from the dock. He has maintained the"
"same position as stated above, and it was his stand that excise officers came to"
"his home and demanded him to hand over heroin, for which he has replied that"
"he has no such thing in his possession. He has taken up the position that when"
"the excise officers could not find any heroin in his possession or in his house,"
"they demanded money from him and because of his refusal, he was implicated"
"for having heroin and the charges against him are false charges."
