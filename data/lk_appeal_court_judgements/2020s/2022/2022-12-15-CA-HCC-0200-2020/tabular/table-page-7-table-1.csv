"submitted that the way the prosecution witnesses have given evidence in relation"
"to  the  informant  cannot  be  considered  probable  in  the  way  the  learned  High"
"Court Judge has determined. It was his contention that no reasonably prudent"
"person  will  take  a  risk  in  the  manner  the  prosecution  witnesses  have  given"
"evidence as to the way the informant has shown the appellant to them and left"
"the place of detection."
"According to the evidence, the informant has accompanied PW-09 and PW-07 up"
"to a communication shop situated by the side of the street where the detection"
"has allegedly taken place. While the two excise officers were waiting outside of"
"the communication shop, the informant has gone inside the shop. After about"
"25  minutes,  the  two  officers  have  noticed  a  person  wearing  the  clothes  as"
"mentioned by the informant and fits the description given, coming towards them."
"At  that  moment,  the  informant  had  come  out  of  the  communication  shop."
"According to the evidence of PW-09, the informant has shown the person coming"
"towards them, saying, that is Kalu, and had left the place discreetly."
"However, according to the evidence of PW-07, the informant had pointed towards"
"the appellant by gestures using his head to indicate that he was the person the"
"witnesses are waiting for, and had left the place."
"It  is  clear  from  the  judgement  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  also  has"
"considered that there is a discrepancy between the evidence of PW-09 and 07 in"
"that regard. However, he has concluded that what the PW-09 referred to as that"
"the  informant  said  (අර එන්නන් කලු)  could  also  mean  the  gestures  referred  to  by"
"PW-07,  and  hence,  there  is  no  material  to  consider  the  said  discrepancy  as"
"relevant."
"With  all  due  respect  to  the  learned  High  Court  Judge’s  determination  of  this"
"matter,  I  am  of  the  view  that  this  was  not  a  discrepancy  that  can  be  lightly"
"disregarded if the probability factor of the version of events by the witnesses are"
"to be considered."
