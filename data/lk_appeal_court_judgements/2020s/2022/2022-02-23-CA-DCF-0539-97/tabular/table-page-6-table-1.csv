"In the instant action even though, the learned District Court Judge has correctly held"
"that the Plaintiff has failed to prove his title, his failure to consider and evaluate the"
"evidence  about  the corpus is  obviously  an error in  terms  of section 187 of the  Civil"
"Procedure Code. Since the Plaintiff has failed to prove his title to the property his action"
"for a declaration of title is liable to be dismissed. That failure of the trial Judge has not"
"caused any prejudice to the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of"
"justice. Therefore, in the light of the above stated Constitutional provisions and the case"
"law, I hold that a necessity does not arise to interfere with the findings of the learned"
"District Judge."
"Hence, I affirm the impugned judgement dated 25.04.1997 of the learned District Court"
"Judge and dismiss the appeal with costs.  The District Judge is directed to enter a decree"
"according to the impugned judgement"
