"The  evidence  led  in  this  action  clearly  establishes  the  fact  that  the  appellant"
"was not an innocent illiterate toddy tapper as he was attempting to portray, but"
"a master manipulator of the circumstances."
"H
e was the paramour of the mother of the deceased who had a child with that"
"union. The deceased was just coming out of her teenage years when he eloped"
"with her after starting an affair with her too. He was smart enough to maintain"
"both the mother and the daughter at two houses, without the mother knowing"
"that he is living with her daughter as well, until she found out about her death."
"It  is  clear  from  the  evidence  of  the  investigating  police  officers  and  the  JMO"
"who visited the scene as a part of his postmortem examination that the rafter"
"the deceased was supposed to have used to hang herself was beyond her reach,"
"given her height. There had been nothing that could have been used as an aid"
"to reach the rafter in the room where the body of the deceased was lying when"
"the police and the JMO visited and even the neighbours and the owner of the"
"estate where they were living, came to the scene of the incident."
"T
he appellant crying and pleading with the others to take the deceased to the"
"hospital cannot be taken as evidence suggestive of his concern on the wellbeing"
"of  the  deceased  as  claimed.  I  find  that  it  may  well  be  an  attempt  by  the"
"appellant to mislead the persons gathered to show that it was a suicide."
"T
he  evidence  of  the  JMO  clearly  establishes  that  the  appellant  had  been  very"
"careful  to  explain  the  major  injuries  that  were  visible  on  the  body  of  the"
"decease  to  him.  Upon  being  questioned  by  the  JMO  as  to  what  happened,  he"
"has  explained  that  due  to  the  quarrel  he  had  with  the  deceased,  he  squeezed"
"her neck and pushed her and hit to the back of her neck using his right hand."
"He has explained further, saying that when he found her hanging, he lifted her"
"and cut the rope using his toddy tapping knife, and the left side of her face hit"
"the cement floor when she fell as a result, and received injuries to the face."
"H
owever,  the  JMO  has  come  to  a  firm  finding  that  the  death  cannot  be  a"
"suicide as claimed. It was his view that the deceased had been strangulated by"
"the use of a rope and later she has been hanged by using the same rope to look"
