"Therefore, the Petitioner is not entitled to a mandate in the nature of a writ of"
"certiorari  to  quash  the  decisions  of  the  2nd  Respondent  contained 
in  the"
"documents marked P11(a), P11(b) and P13(a)."
"A mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari is issued to quash a decision which"
"is ultra vires. A writ of prohibition is issued to forbid some act or decision which"
"would be ultra vires. Certiorari looks to the past and Prohibition to the future."
"For  the  same  aforementioned  reasons,  the  Petitioner 
is  not  entitled  to  a"
"mandate in the nature of a writ of prohibition as prayed for by paragraph (b) of"
"the prayer to the Petition."
"The Petitioner is also seeking for a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus"
"compelling the 1st and 2nd Respondents to recognize and secure the right of way"
"exercised by the Petitioner over the 3rd Respondent’s land. The Petitioner has"
"failed  to  establish  that  he  has  a  legal right  to  use  a  right of way  over  the  3rd"
"Respondent’s  land.  Without  establishing  such  a  right,  the  Petitioner  cannot"
"invite court to compel the 1st and 2nd Respondents to recognize and secure such"
"a right. As stated by Sripavan J (as he then was) to ask for a writ of mandamus"
"one must have a legal right which is in violation. It is that legal right which gives"
"rise to the corresponding legal duty on the part of the Respondents – Borella"
"Nursing Homes (PVT) LTD v Bandaranayake and others."
"As the Petitioner has failed to establish a legal right to use this right of way over"
"the 3rd Respondent’s land, no corresponding duty will arise on the part of the 1st"
"and 2nd Respondents and therefore, the application of the Petitioner for a writ"
"of mandamus must necessarily fail."
"For  the  aforesaid  reasons, 
I  dismiss  the  application  of  the  Petitioner  for"
"mandates in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition and mandamus."
