"If it is the case of the Petitioner that he had acquired a servitude for a right of"
"way over the land of the 3rd Respondent and his father by prescriptive user, it"
"was  up  to  the  Petitioner  to  get  a  declaration  to  that  effect  from  the  District"
"Court. The District Court alone can decide that matter and  the Petitioner had"
"not thought it fit to get a declaration to that effect from the District Court. The"
"Divisional Secretary or the Land Commissioner cannot adjudicate that matter"
"and decide whether the Petitioner is entitled to a right of way by prescriptive"
"user over the 3rd Respondent’s land and her father’s land."
"The Divisional Secretary has the authority to demarcate roads across state land,"
"provide access to state lands, regularize the user of such roads, paths, means of"
"access, close down unauthorized roads and foot paths over state land, etc. The"
"state  had  not  authorized  the  Petitioner  to  use  a  foot  path  over  the  3rd"
"Respondent’s  and  her 
father’s 
lands. 
Instead,  the  state  had  provided  an"
"alternative roadway to the Petitioner’s land as shown in the Plan marked 2R5."
"Without using  the  road  that  has  been provided by  the  state  the  Petitioner  is"
"using a foot path over the 3rd Respondent’s land as a means of access to his land."
"Without using the road shown in 2R5 for which the Petitioner is legally entitled"
"to, the Petitioner is using an unauthorized path over the 3rd Respondent’s land."
"Therefore, the Petitioner has not come to  court with clean hands.  “The most"
"active  remedies  of  administrative 
law  –  declaration, 
injunction,  certiorari,"
"prohibition,  mandamus  –  are  discretionary  and 
the  court  may 
therefore"
"withhold them if it thinks fit. In other words, the court may find some act to be"
"unlawful  but  may  nevertheless  decline  to  intervene”  (Administrative  Law  by"
"Wade & Forsyth – 9th edition page 700). As the Petitioner in this case has not"
"come to court with clean hands this  court should decline to intervene  in this"
"matter. As the state had not authorized the Petitioner to use a path over the 3rd"
"Respondent’s land and provided an alternative road and as the Petitioner has"
"failed to establish that he has acquired a servitude of a right of way over the 3rd"
"Respondent’s land by prescriptive user, the 2nd Respondent as the authorized"
"officer to provide access to state land is empowered to direct the Petitioner not"
"to use a foot path over the 3rd Respondent’s land and use the road shown in 2R5"
"to which the Petitioner is legally entitled to. That act of the 2nd Respondent is"
"within the framework of the statutory functions of the 2nd Respondent and the"
"Petitioner cannot complain that the act of the 2nd Respondent is ultra vires or"
"illegal."
