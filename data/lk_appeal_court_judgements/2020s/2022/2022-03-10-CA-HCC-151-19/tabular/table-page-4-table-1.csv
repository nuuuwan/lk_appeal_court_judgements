"including the deceased, were inside the building, those persons left the"
"premises."
"W
hen the defence was called after the prosecution case was closed, the"
"appellant made a dock statement and stated that “On the date, I went"
"to  the  betting  center,  there  was  a  commotion  at  this  place  and  the"
"telephone was fallen down. Thereafter, I kept it on the table.”"
"T
he  contentions  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  appellant"
"were based on the following three main grounds."
"1.  A common murderous intention on the part of the appellant had"
"not been proved by the prosecution."
"2.  The  circumstantial  evidence  against 
the  appellant  was  not"
"properly evaluated."
"3.  The learned High Court judge failed to evaluate the contradictions"
"in prosecution witnesses."
"A
lthough the aforesaid grounds are stated in the written submissions"
"tendered on behalf of the appellant, the learned President’s Counsel did"
"not  make  submissions  regarding  contradictions.  However, 
in 
the"
"written submission, it was mentioned that PW 18 had stated that the"
"telephone receiver was found under the table of the cashier and PW 15"
"stated that PW 18 had told him that the telephone receiver was found"
"in  the  manager’s  room.  Although,  this  has  been  pointed  out  as  a"
"contradiction, PW 15 has said that he stayed outside of the premises"
"until PW 18 entered the crime scene. Furthermore, PW 15 clearly stated"
"that  he  did  not  know  exactly  where  the  receiver  was  and  PW  18  told"
"him  that  the  receiver  was  on  the  floor  of  the  manager’s  room.  In"
"addition, PW 2 stated while describing the incident, that the cashier’s"
"table  was 
in  the  manager’s  room 
(page  110  of  the  appeal  brief)."
"Therefore, it is clear that there is no contradiction between the evidence"
"of PW 18 and PW 15 on that point."
