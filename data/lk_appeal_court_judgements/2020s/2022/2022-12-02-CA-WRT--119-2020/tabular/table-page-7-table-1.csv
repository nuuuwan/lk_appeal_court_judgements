"We  are  of  the  view  that  there  is  no  merit  to  the  present  application.  This  is"
"primarily because the Petitioner has not proffered any reason as to what he was doing at"
"the  relevant  time  or  what  his  involvement  was  in  this  whole  saga.  We  do  not  wish  to"
"speculate  what  the  reason  may  have  been,  although  his  involvement  continues  to  be"
"shrouded in secrecy. When that is the case, it only adds to the speculation. Nevertheless,"
"the Petitioner had opted not to explain this at the disciplinary inquiry. It was only before"
"the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and now before this Court that he claims that “he"
"had not been in the lorry when he was arrested” (vide paragraph 7(e) of the Petition)."
"There  is  no  denying  that  he  was  arrested.  The  acquittal  as  identified  by  the"
"Administrative Appeals Tribunal appears to be based on the contradictions in the witness"
"testimonies,  especially  in  relation  to  the  place  and  manner  of  the  arrest.  There  was"
"nothing  to  suggest that the  Petitioner  was  wrongly arrested  or  that  he was  not at  the"
"scene.  It  is  not  for  this  Court  sitting  in  judicial  review  to  assess  such  evidence  and  to"
"examine the correctness of the decision as that is an exercise for a Court exercising its"
"appellate jurisdiction. This Court exercising review must examine the lawfulness of the"
"order of the Tribunal on the grounds of judicial review, none of which have been made out"
"in the instant application."
"The  fact  of  the  matter  is  the  Petitioner  has  tarnished  the  good  repute  and"
"unimpeachable  conduct  that  is  expected  of  a  Police  Officer  because  of  his  dealing.  An"
"opportunity to defend himself and explain matters that were known only to him was not"
"taken advantage of and it is not possible now for this Court to undertake an appellate"
"exercise. We are reminded of the proverb, “Caesar’s wife must be above suspicion”. It is"
"conduct such as that which the Petitioner is accused of which brings the entire police force"
"into disrepute. It is conduct unbecoming of an officer expected to enforce the law."
"Further, his allegation that his request for an outsider to conduct the disciplinary"
"inquiry was denied, and that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal did not consider it, is"
"without merit. This is because there is no material to substantiate his position that he did"
"make such a request at the initial inquiry itself."
"In Dharmasena v. Shanker [2006] 3 SLR 169, his Lordship Sriskandarajah J. in"
"response  to  the  Petitioner’s  submission  that  the  inquirer  was  biased  observed  on  page"
"171: “without raising this objection before the inquirer the Petitioner cannot raise this objection"
