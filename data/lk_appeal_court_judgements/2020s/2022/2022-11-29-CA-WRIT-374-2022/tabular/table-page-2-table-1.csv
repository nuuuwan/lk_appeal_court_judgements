"Sobhitha Rajakaruna J."
"A writ of Certiorari is sought by the Petitioner to quash the quit notice (‘P2’) issued under"
"the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, as amended, (‘Act’) against"
"the Petitioner in reference to the land morefully described in the schedule to the said quit"
"notice  (‘Land’).  Additionally,  the  Petitioner  seeks  a  writ  of  Prohibition  to  restrain  the"
"Respondents from taking steps to eject him and also an interim order is sought to stay the"
"proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court of Matara bearing case No. 52049 filed against the"
"Petitioner under the said Act in respect of the same land."
"The Petitioner’s alleged ground of challenge is that he was in occupation of the Land for"
"a long time and accordingly, he has prescriptive tittle to the land. The Petitioner further"
"contends that the 1st Respondent is duty bound to establish the fact that the Land belongs"
"to State."
"The Petitioner heavily relies on the judgement in Senanayake vs. Damunupola (1982) 2"
"Sri. L.R. 621 where Victor Perera J. held that a.) the said Act was not meant to obtain"
"possession of land which the State had lost possession of by encroachment or ouster for, a"
"considerable period of time by ejecting a person in such possession; b.) the Section 3 should"
"not be used by a competent authority to eject a person who has been found by him to be"
"in  possession  of  a  land  where  there  is  doubt  whether  the  State  had  title  or  where  the"
"possessor relies on a long period of possession."
"Significantly, this judgement was delivered prior to the amendment to the said Act brought"
"into  by  way  of  the  Amendment  Act  No.  29  of  1983.  When  discussing  the  judicial"
"precedent, generally, the ratio decidendi of a judgement can be overruled by an appellate"
"court in the hierarchy. Also, it is seen that the Parliament enact laws giving the same effect"
"of overruling a judgement. The above Damunupola case is a unique instance where the"
"legislature  brought  an  amendment  to  the  said  Act  to  overcome  the  effect  of  the  said"
"judgement  in  the Damunupola  case.  I  must  draw  my  attention  to  the  Hansard  dated"
"09.08.1983  of  the  Parliament  of  Sri  Lanka  which  reflects  the  speech  made  by  the  then"
"Minister of Lands, Lands Development & Mahaweli after the order for second reading of"
"the  bill  in  reference  to  the  said  Amendment  Act  No.  29  of  1983.  The  said  Minister"
"submitted  to  House  the  purpose  of  introducing  the  said  Amendment  and  categorically"
"referred  to  the  said Damunupola case  identifying  the  same  as  the  reason  to  which  the"
