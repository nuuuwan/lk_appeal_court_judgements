"asking  the  question  whether  Parliament  can 
fairly  be  taken  to  have"
"intended total invalidity."
"[33]  Now  the  question  is,  to  which  category  does  Section  10  in  this  case"
"belong? The question as to whether Section 10 is mandatory or directory"
"depends  on  the 
intent  of  the 
legislature  and  not  upon 
its 
language,"
"irrespective of the fact that Section 10 is couched in language which refers"
"to the word “shall”. The intention of the legislature must be ascertained not"
"only  from  the  phraseology  of  Section  10,  but  also  by  considering 
its"
"purpose, its design and more importantly, the consequences which would"
"follow from construing it one way of another."
"[34] Now the question is, what is the consequence of the failure to adhere"
"to  the  time  limit  specified  by  Section  10  that  has  been  intended  by  the"
"legislature to be categorized as mandatory or directory. That is how I would"
"approach 
this  question,  which 
is  ultimately  a  question  of  statutory"
"construction of Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act,  No. 23 of"
"2011 (as amended).  Accordingly, one has to identify the tests to be applied"
"in deciding whether a provision that has been disregarded is mandatory or"
"directory,  and 
then  apply 
them 
to 
the  statute  which  stipulates 
the"
"determination  shall  be  made  within  the  time  limit  specified  therein,  but"
"makes no reference to any penal consequences."
"Consequence of non-compliance with a Statutory Provision"
"Purpose of the section in the context of the statute"
"[35]  In  considering  a  procedural  requirement  from  this  angle,  a  court  is"
"likely to construe it as mandatory if it seems to be of particular importance"
"in the context of the enactment, or if it is one of a series of detailed steps,"
"perhaps  in  legislation  which  has  created  a  novel  jurisdiction,  (Warwick v."
"White  (1722)  Bunb.  106;  145  E.R.  612)  or  if  non-compliance  might  have"
"entailed  penal  consequences  for  one  of  the  parties  (State of Jammu and"
"Kashmir v. Abdul Ghani (1979)  Ker  LJ  46).  Where  the  disobedience  of  a"
"provision  is  made  penal,  it  can  safely  be  said  that  such  provision  was"
"intended by the legislature to be mandatory (Seth Banarsi Das v. The Cane"
"Commissioner & Another, AIR 1955 All 86)."
"[36]  As  noted,  the  fact  that  no  penal  consequence  is  stated  in  a  statute,"
"however, 
is  only  one 
factor 
to  be  considered 
towards  a  directory"
