"and having an avoidance of doubt clause in Section 15 of the Tax Appeals"
"Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 makes it very clear that the"
"intention  of  Parliament  is  that  Section  10  as  amended,  is  a  mandatory"
"provision of law which requires strict compliance."
"[10] He further submitted that though the determination of the Tax Appeals"
"Commission  states 
that 
the  dates  of  hearing  were  16.06.2016  and"
"10.11.2016,  these  dates  of  hearings  are  incorrect  in  view  of  the  fact  that"
"there had been prior hearings on 24.06.2014 and 07.08.2014 as indicated"
"at pages 49-50 and pages 193-194 of the record of proceedings.  He further"
"submitted  that  the  Appellant  has  further  tendered  written  submissions"
"dated  22.07.2014 
(pp.  161-182)  and 
thereafter, 
the  Appellant  was"
"requested to be present to fix a new date for the hearing (pp. 191-192) and"
"thereafter, the date of the hearing was re-fixed for 28.05.2015 (p. 208). He"
"submitted that the subsequent hearings were held on 16.06.2016 (pp. 222-"
"223)  and  on  10.11.2016.  Accordingly,  Dr.  Felix 
submitted 
that 
the"
"determination of the appeal has taken more than 270 days from the date"
"of the first oral hearing that took place on 24.06.2014 and therefore, the"
"appeal before the Tax Appeals Commission is time barred by operation of"
"law and the appeal must be deemed to have been allowed in view of the"
"fact that it stands abated."
"[11] He drew our attention to the following statement made by His Lordship"
"Gooneratne  J.  in Mohideen v. Commissioner -General of Inland Revenue"
"(CA  2/2007
