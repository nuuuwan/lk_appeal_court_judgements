"to consider the broad purpose and object of the statute as Lord Penzance"
"stated in Howard v. Bodington (supra) at 211 as follows:"
"“
I
 believe, as far as any rule is concerned, you cannot safely go further"
"than that in each case you must look into the subject-matter:  consider"
"the importance of the provision that has been disregarded, and the"
"relation of that provision to the general object intended to be secured"
"by the Act; and upon a review of the case in that aspect decide whether"
"the matter is what is called imperative or only directory.”"
