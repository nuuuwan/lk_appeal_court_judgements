"Cambridge Advance Learners’ Dictionary defines the term “exportation” as"
"“the process of sending goods to another country for sale”.  In the Merriam-"
"Webster  Online  Dictionary,  the  term  export  means  “to  carry  or  send"
"(something, such as a commodity) to some other place (such as another"
"country).  Accordingly,  the  Dictionary  meaning  of  the  word  “export”  of"
"goods  as  normally  understood  is  “sending  goods”  from  one  country  to"
"another country for sale."
"[123] However, the meaning of a word in a statute may also be affected"
"by its context, which may consist of surrounding sections, the whole Act"
"or  the  scheme  or  purpose  of  the 
legislation  and  the  exceptions  or"
"deduction granted thereunder.  Thus, one has to construe the scope of"
"the term “export” in the context in which it occurs in Sections 42 and 52"
"of the Inland Revenue Act, having regard to the nature of the goods that"
"are to be exported, namely, the bunker fuel being a  petroleum product"
"which  is  not  manufactured  in  Sri  Lanka  but,  used  for  the  navigation  of"
"vessels,  and 
the  purpose 
for  which  such  exports  are  qualified 
for"
"concessionary tax rates under the Inland Revenue Act."
"Imports & Exports (Control) Act"
"[124] The Appellant, however argues that as the Inland Revenue Act does"
"not define the term “export”, nor does it specify the criteria that must be"
"affirmatively satisfied in order that a supply may be classified as an export,"
"recourse  must  be  had  to  the  general  principles  of  law  applicable  for  the"
"purposes  of  determining  what  constitutes  an  export.  This  Court  is  now"
"required to find out what is meant by the phrase "" export"" for the purpose"
"of the Section 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, and whether the mere"
"supply of bunker fuel to a ship constitutes an export under Sections  42 or"
"52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006."
"[125] The Appellant relies on the definition of the term “exportation given"
"in the Stroud Judicial Dictionary, Vo. II 1903 referring to the decision in A.G."
"v
 
Pougett 2 Price, 381) and Stockton Ry v. Barrett, 11 Cl. & F. 590) in support"
"of  his  contention  that  the  word  “export”  for  the  purpose  of  the  Inland"
"Revenue  Act,  is  not  restricted  to  an  exportation  to  foreign  countries,  but"
"may mean a carrying out of the Port The Stroud Judicial Dictionary, Vo. II"
"1903  defines  the  term  “exportation”  referring  to  the  decision  in  A.G. v"
