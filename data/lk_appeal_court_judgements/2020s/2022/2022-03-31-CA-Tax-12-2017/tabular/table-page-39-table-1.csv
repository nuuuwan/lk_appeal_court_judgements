"must  involve  an  export  from  one  country,  and  an  import  into  another"
"country;  and  (iv)  the  transaction  should  possess  the  characteristics  of  an"
"international sale of goods transaction."
"[102] She submitted that the Appellant neither took the goods outside Sri"
"Lanka, nor caused the foreign vessel to take the goods outside Sri Lanka"
"with a final destination outside Sri Lanka as the contracts entered by the"
"Appellant do not provide for a terminus outside the territorial waters of Sri"
"Lanka.  She  submitted  that  as  far  as  the  Appellant  was  concerned,  the"
"terminus was within Sri Lanka, and the transaction between the Appellant"
"and the vessel  owners/charterers was  a local transaction that took place"
"within the territorial waters of Sri Lanka and thus, the final destination was"
"not  outside  Sri  Lanka.  She 
further  submitted  that 
in  any  event,  the"
"Appellant had no control over the ships’ journeys; and thus, it is manifest"
"that  the  goods  have  remained  within  the  territorial  waters  of  Sri  Lanka,"
"indefinitely."
"[103] Referring  to  the test of international sale of goods transaction, she"
"argued that the Appellant has failed to produce a single document such as"
"a Bill of Lading, Marine Insurance, invoices and letters of credit, and that"
"the  Appellant’s  documents  do  not  support  that  its  transaction  could  be"
"catheterized  as 
international  sale  of  goods 
transaction.  She  argued,"
"therefore, that the supply of bunker fuel was no export within the meaning"
"of Section 42 or qualified export within the meaning of Section 52 of the"
"Inland Revenue Act."
"[104] The Tax Appeals Commission in holding that the bunker fuel supplied"
"by  the  Appellant  to  ships  travelling  from  Sri  Lanka  cannot  constitute  an"
"export in the absence of a foreign destination, relied on the test adopted"
"by  Hidayatullah  J.    in  the  Indian  Supreme  Court  case  in Burmah-Shell Oil"
