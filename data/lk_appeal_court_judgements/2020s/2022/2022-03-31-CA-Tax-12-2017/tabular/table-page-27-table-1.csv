"specified 
in  Section  10. 
In 
the  present  case, 
the  duty 
to  make 
the"
"determination  within  the  time  limit  specified  in  Section  10  is  statutorily"
"entrusted to the members of the Tax Appeals Commission in terms of the"
"provisions  of 
the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act,  No.  23  of  2011 
(as"
"amended),  and  the  parties  had  no  control  whatsoever,  over  the  Tax"
"Appeals Commission."
"[63] As Lord Sir Arthur Channell put it correctly, it would cause the greatest"
"injustice to both parties who had no control over those entrusted with the"
"duty of making the determination, if we hold that neglect to observe the"
"time limit specified in Section 10 of the statute renders the determination"
"made by the Commission ipso facto null and void."
"[64] In my view, every limitation period within which an act must be done,"
"is not necessarily a prescription of the period of limitation with painful and"
"drastic consequences. The  parties who have no control of those entrusted"
"with a statutory duty and no fault of them should not be made to suffer"
"and 
lose  their  rights  for  the  failure  to  adhere  to  the  time 
limitation"
"specified in a provision."
"[65] The answer to this question is further provided by Sharvananda J. (as"
"he then was) in Nagalingam v. Lakshman de Mel (78 NLR 231), which is not"
"a fundamental right case.  The question before His Lordship was whether"
"the  provisions  of  Section  2  (2)  (c)  of  the  Termination  of  Employment  of"
"Workmen 
(Special  Provisions)  Act,  No.  45  of  1971  are  mandatory  or"
"directory. His Lordship Sharvananda J. (as he then was) stated at page 237:"
