"the  period  or  date  allowed  for  the  completion  of  an  appeal  beyond  the"
"stipulated  period  of  30  days  after  the  date  of  the  notice  of  assessment"
"when the appeal has been filed out of time under Section 165 (1)."
"[92] The natural meaning of the phrase ""extension of time"" is a reference"
"to the period allowed for the works being made longer from the stipulated"
"completion date, and not the creation of a separate period of  delay. The"
"natural meaning and the general position that extensions of time will only"
"be  granted  for  a  period  which  reflects  the  actual  delay  caused  by  not"
"completing a relevant event (here the filing of the appeal) on a due date."
"The wording (extension of time) used in the proviso is sufficiently clear to"
"displace  the  position  that  the  when  the  invalid  appeal  of  the  Appellant"
"made on 25.07.2011  is accepted, the date shall be treated as the date of"
"the appeal (25.07.2011) which was invalidated by delay in terms of Section"
"165 (1)."
"[93] In terms of Chapter XXIII of the Inland Revenue Act, an appeal made"
"against  the  notice  of  assessment  can  be  either  validly  acknowledged  or"
"rejected for the failure to file it within time. In the present case, the appeal"
"was rejected and the same was communicated to the Appellant within 30"
"days from the date of the receipt of the belated appeal."
"[94]  The  Respondent  did  not  treat  the  appeal  as  a  valid  appeal  on  the"
"ground that the appeal was rejected on a mistake of fact on the part of"
"the Respondent, but after lengthy discussions, the Respondent granted an"
"extension of time to receive the appeal with effect from 22.08.2011. The"
"process of granting an extension in the circumstances naturally took time,"
"as the Respondent did not admit any mistake on its part in not sending the"
"notice of assessment to the Appellant or that the appeal was rejected due"
"to its fault. The Appellant himself sought clarifications and documentations"
"from  the  Respondent  with  regard  to  the  notice  of  assessment  (pp.  64,"
"63,67,69,  74,  73).  After  several  discussions,  the  Respondent  decided  on"
"29.08.2011 to grant an extension of time and accept the late appeal with"
"effect from 22.08.2011."
"[95] Once an extension is granted under the proviso, upon the application"
"of the Appellant by letter dated 22.08.2011, the period of extension should"
"run  from  the  date  on  which  the  valid  appeal  shall  be  filed  and  complete"
