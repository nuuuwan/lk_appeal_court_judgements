"Regarding the dock statement of the 1st appellant, the learned Deputy"
"Solicitor General stated that if a bribe was offered and the 3rd appellant"
"did  not  want  to  take  it,  what  could  be  expected  from  him  is  to  file  a"
"complaint for bribery. Since he has not done so on three occasions, the"
"learned Deputy Solicitor General contended that his dock statement is"
"improbable.  It  is  my  view  that  when  bribes  are  offered,  there  may  be"
"instances where complaints are made. However, it cannot be assumed"
"that all police officers who do not want to take bribes will necessarily"
"complain whenever bribes are offered. Hence, I regret that I am unable"
"to agree with the contention that the 1st appellantâ€™s dock statement is"
"improbable."
