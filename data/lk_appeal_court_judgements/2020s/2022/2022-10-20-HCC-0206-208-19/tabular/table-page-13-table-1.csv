"The learned Deputy Solicitor General replied that although all notes had"
"been  made  by  July  24th,  2005,  PW-1  had  no  way  of  knowing  what"
"happened in the police station. There is merit in this contention."
"However, PW-1 knew that a case would be filed in the Magistrateâ€™s Court"
"on  28.07.2005.  The  reason  that  the  PW-1  told  the  3rd  appellant  for"
"giving only Rs.10,000/- and promising to give the balance Rs.5,000/-"
"within a few days was that the case was coming up on the 28th. Decoy,"
"PW-3, has also stated the same reason for giving only Rs.10,000/-. The"
"case  that  came  up  on  28.07.2005  was  the  case  filed  against  Udara"
"Lakmal for the goda taken into custody. PW-1 also knew that the case"
"would be filed not against him but against Lakmal because he stated"
"that on the date of the raid, Lakmal was arrested by the police and later"
"released on bail."
"Therefore, although PW-1 did not know when the notes were made and"
"finalized  in  the  police  station,  any  person  with  common  sense  would"
"understand that everything would be finalized by 27th if a case is filed"
"on  the  28th.  Especially,  a  person  like  PW-1  who  was  engaged  in  the"
"illicit liquor business would know these things very well."
"Under these circumstances, PW-1 could easily understand that giving"
"Rs.10,000/-  as a bribe  serves no purpose,  even though  the case  was"
"scheduled to be filed for one barrel of goda or five barrels of goda.  If"
"the case had been filed for one barrel of goda, there was no need to give"
"a bribe. If the case had been filed for five barrels, there was no purpose"
"of  giving  a  bribe  because  it  could  not  be  changed.  The  prosecution"
"witness, the OIC, confirms that no changes could be made under any"
"circumstance  after  the  productions  were  handed  over  to  the  police"
"station and notes were made."
