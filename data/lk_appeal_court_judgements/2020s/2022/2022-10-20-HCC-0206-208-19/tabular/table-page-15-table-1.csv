"that he gave money but the 3rd appellant did not accept.  Therefore, it"
"is apparent even though PW-1 and PW-3, the decoy, together attempted"
"to give money to the 3rd appellant on those three occasions, he refused"
"in accepting the money. Ultimately, PW-1 and PW-3, the decoy, say that"
"on 27.07.2005, the 3rd appellant accepted Rs.10,000/- in a by-road of"
"the Anuradhapura Road. The 3rd and 1st appellants both knew very well"
"by  26.07.2005  that  they  couldnâ€™t  do  anything  even  though  the  bribe"
"was not given because they had finalized everything to file a court case"
"by that date. If the 1st and 3rd appellants wanted to accept a bribe in"
"such a situation, they would accept the money whenever it was offered,"
"and the 3rd appellant would certainly not refuse to accept the money in"
"this manner."
