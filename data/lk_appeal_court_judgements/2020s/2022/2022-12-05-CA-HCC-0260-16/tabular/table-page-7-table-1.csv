"It clearly appears from the judgement of the learned High Court Judge that the"
"discrepancies  as  to  the  time  of  arrest  in  the  evidence  of  PW-01  has  been  well"
"considered. When considering the sequence of events that has taken place after"
"PW-01 and his team has left the police station around 7 a.m., it is clear that PW-"
"01 stating in one occasion that the arrest was between 7.02 and 7.05 a.m. was"
"either a genuine mistake or a typographical error as correctly observed by the"
"learned High Court Judge. However, the witness has corrected himself as to the"
"time  of  arrest  in  his  evidence.  If  one  considers  the  timeline  of  the  events  that"
"have  taken  place  before  and  after  the  arrest  of  the  appellant,  it  clearly  shows"
"that the arrest had been at 11.45 a.m. and it was only thereafter, that he has"
"been taken to the police station and his statement has been recorded. After that,"
"the police have accompanied him to the Kuliyapitiya hospital for the weighing of"
"the quantity of heroin found in his possession."
"PW-11 who is an independent witness has testified that the police came with the"
"appellant and it was she who weighed the productions."
"When  taken  as  a  whole,  it  is  abundantly  clear  that  such  a  trivial  mistake  in"
"evidence  which  has  been  subsequently  well  explained  cannot  be  treated  as  a"
"discrepancy that go into the root of the matter."
"It was stated in Sarkar on Evidence, 15th Edition, page 112;"
