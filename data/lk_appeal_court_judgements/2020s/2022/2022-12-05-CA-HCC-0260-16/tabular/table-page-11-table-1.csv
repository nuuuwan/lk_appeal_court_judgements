"In the case of Alwis Vs. Piyasena Fernando (1993) 1 SLR 119, G.P.S.D. Silva"
"CJ. observed that the Court of Appeal would not lightly disturb the findings of"
"primary facts made by a trial judge unless it is manifestly wrong as they have"
"the priceless advantage of observing the demeanor of witnesses which the judge"
"of the Court of Appeal does not have."
"I am of the view that this is a judgement pronounced by the learned High Court"
"Judge after giving due consideration to the evidence placed before him with good"
"reasoning, which is a judgement that needs no interference by this Court."
"Hence, the appeal of the appellant is dismissed for want of merit. The conviction"
"and the sentence affirmed."
