"In the Indian case of Mohamad Radhi Bin Yaakob Vs. Public Prosecutor (1991)"
"3CLJ2073, it was held that;"
"“In a criminal matter, at the close of the defence case, what the Court needs"
"to decide is to whether the defence has succeeded to raise any reasonable"
"doubt  on  the  prosecution  case.  If  the  answer  is  in  the  positive,  then  the"
"accused person is entitled to his acquittal. It has to be remembered always"
"that at no time, except in special circumstances, the burden of proof is cast"
"on the defence. The burden rests all throughout on the prosecution to prove"
"its case beyond reasonable doubt.”"
