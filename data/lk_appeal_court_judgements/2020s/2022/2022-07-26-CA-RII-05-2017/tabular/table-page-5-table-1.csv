"To  substantiate  this  position,  she  submitted  an  affidavit  (marked  “P3”)  of  the"
"doctor  who  treated  her  father  for  this  illness  until  his  demise.  A  Medical  Certificate"
"(marked “P2” on Page 733 of the Brief) issued by one doctor (it is not clear if the Report"
"was issued by the same Doctor that gave the affidavit) notes that the Petitioner’s father"
"was suffering a case of hypertension with paralysis since February 1989."
"Apart  from  these  two  documents,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  Petitioner  has"
"submitted to establish the actual physical and mental condition in which her father was"
"at the relevant time. An applicant seeking an extraordinary remedy such as restitution,"
"which has extraordinary consequences if granted such as wiping the slate entirely clean,"
"ought to provide material that would substantiate his/her position at least on a balance"
"of  probabilities.  Without  casting  aspersions  on  the  work  of  the  Doctor,  to a  reasonable"
"person  the  Medical  Certificate and  the  Affidavit, in the absence  of any  other  evidence,"
"appears to have been created for the purpose of satisfying the claim."
"We are of the view that these two documents alone do not meet that standard of"
"proof as clearer proof, including more contemporaneous ones such as hospital records or"
"prescriptions, would have helped to clearly establish matters such as the time period in"
"which  the  Petitioner’s  father  was  paralysed  (instead  of  a  bare  assertion  that  he  was"
"paralysed from sometime around February 1989); whether he was bed-ridden or whether"
"he could move with the assistance of some person (which do not appear to be conclusive"
"in the Doctor’s affidavit and Medical Certificate), whether he was completely physically"
"and mentally incapable of signing the deeds and the proxy or giving consent to the same;"
"whether  it  was  the  same  doctor  that  treated  the  Petitioner’s  father.  This  is  especially"
"because in all the deeds executed, as aforesaid, the Petitioner’s father seems to have been"
"ably present and signed in the presence of the Notary, other executants, and witnesses."
"The Petitioner’s father had duly filed his statement of claim in the partition action as well."
"The  Petitioner  further  alleges  that  the  purported  substitution  in  the  partition"
"action takes place only on the 26th of October 1992 (two years after her father’s death) and"
"that  in  the  intermediary  period  between  her  father’s  demise  and  the  substitution  two"
"years later the case proceeded as if no death had taken place. The proxy of the Petitioner"
"had been filed in Court on 26th October 1992 by Mr. Shirley Jayaweera, Attorney-at-Law,"
"as  per  Journal  Entry  No.  34  (Page  38  of  the  Brief)  dated  the  same.  Notice  of  the"
"Petitioner’s father’s demise is brought to Court’s attention on the previous date when the"
