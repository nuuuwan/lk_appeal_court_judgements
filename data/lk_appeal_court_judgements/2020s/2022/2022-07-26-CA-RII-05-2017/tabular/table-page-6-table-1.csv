"The  Petitioner  has  submitted  an  affidavit  of  Attorney-at-Law  Mr.  Shirley"
"Jayaweera (marked “P6”) who denies ever having tendered a proxy on her behalf at the"
"District  Court. This  Affidavit is  dated  10th  January  2017,  more  than  twenty-five  years"
"after the date of submission of the proxy to the Court. A question then arises, as neither"
"the affidavit discloses nor is any material provided, as to how the learned Counsel was"
"able to ascertain that it was not him that submitted the proxy to Court."
"If  the  correctness  of  the  Journal  Entry  is  to  be  challenged,  then  an  application"

"In Jayaweera v. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura [1996] 2 SLR"
