"It should be noted that the Petitioner’s husband derived title from his father-in-"
"law in April 1988, nine to ten months before the father’s paralysis. The Petitioner is not"
"challenging the validity of that Deed of Gift. Although it seems odd that the father decided"
"to  gift  his  shares  of  the  land  to  his  son-in-law  instead  of  his  daughter  (the  Petitioner)"
"nevertheless, in the absence of a challenge to that deed by which the Petitioner’s husband"
"obtained title to the land, the Petitioner would not be entitled to claim that share of the"
"land as the Petitioner’s husband has lawfully obtained title to it and conveyed it to the 1st"
"Respondent,  supposedly  with  the  Petitioner’s  father  signing  as  the  life  interest  holder."
"Even if the Petitioner proves that her father did not sign the deeds as the life interest"
"holder, in the absence of the Petitioner’s father revoking the deed, the title remains with"
"his  son-in-law.  Either  way,  the  Petitioner  will  not  be  entitled  to  claim  shares  to  that"
"portion of the land."
