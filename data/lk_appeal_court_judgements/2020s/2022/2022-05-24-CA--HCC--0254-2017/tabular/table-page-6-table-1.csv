"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  very  correctly  analyzed  the  evidence"
"adduced  by  both  parties  to  arrive  at  his  finding.  As  the  Appellant  was"
"absconding during the pendency of the trial and when the defence was called"
"by  the  court,  the  Appellant  had  failed  to  adduce  evidence  on  his  behalf."
"Despite that the Learned High Court Judge without prejudicing himself, had"
"properly analyzed the evidence presented and had come to a correct finding."
"Hence, this ground too has no merit."
"In this case the prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating evidence"
"against the Appellant. The Learned High Court Judge had properly analyzed"
"and considered all the evidence presented by both parties and come to his"
"conclusion that the Appellant is guilty of the charge levelled against him."
"As the Learned High Court Judge had rightly convicted the Appellant for the"
"charge of attempted murder and had given a very lenient custodial sentence,"
"I affirm the conviction and dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant."
"The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court"
"of Gampaha along with the original case record."
