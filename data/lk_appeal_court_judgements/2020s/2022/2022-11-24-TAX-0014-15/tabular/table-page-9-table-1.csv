"In the case of Gamini Bus Company, Ltd v. Commissioner of Income Tax"
"34 (Privy Council) it was held that even extracting data from a third party’s"
"tax  file  without  disclosing  the  taxpayer’s  identity  does  not  breach  the"
"principle of fair play and natural justice."
"Therefore,  in  my  view,  the  Assessor  and  CGIR  has  acted  lawfully  in"
"obtaining information from the account statements of Samson Rubber, the"
"sister company of the Appellant, in deciding to reject the return submitted"
"by the Appellant."
"E. Gooneratne states the following on rejection of accounts:35"
"‘The  account  prepared  for  each  accounting  period  is  a  summary  of  the"
"entries  in  the  books  of  account.  The  statement  of  account  annexed  to  a"
"return, or submitted later, if required, is evidence tendered to prove the"
"correctness of the return. A rejection of the account is a rejection of the"
"evidence  relied  upon  by  the  person  assessed.  An  assessor  may  give  the"
"assessee  an opportunity  of supporting  his return  by  producing accounts"
"certified  by  an  Accountant.  The  opportunity  he  gives  to  an  assessee  to"
"produce certified accounts is an act done in the exercise of the discretion"
"given to him to accept or reject the return.36 The rejection of the account"
"when produced is also an act done in the exercise of the discretion given"
"to  him  to  accept  or  reject  the  return.  He  can  reject  accounts  which  he"
"believes to be false and unreliable although there is no direct or reliable"
"evidence to prove them incorrect.37 The sufficiency of the reason given for"
"rejecting  the  accounts  cannot  be  questioned;  except  in  the  course of  an"
"appeal  against  the  assessment.  The  omission  of  a  single  item  of  receipt"
"from  the  accounts  is  a  sufficient  reason  for  rejecting  the  account  if  the"
"omission cannot be explained. The intentional omission of an item entitles"
"the assessor to conclude that the account cannot be relied upon to show"
"the whole of the trading profit.’38"
"For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the TAC did not err in"
"arriving at the conclusion that the loan given to the Appellant by Samson"
