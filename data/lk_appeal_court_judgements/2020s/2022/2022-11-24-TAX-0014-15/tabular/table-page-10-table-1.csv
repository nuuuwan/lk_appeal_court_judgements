"Rubber was not reflected in the lender’s accounts. Furthermore, the TAC"
"did not err in determining that the debit notes ‘D 6’, ‘D 6 (1)’, ‘D 6 (2)’,"
"‘D 6 (3)’ and the ledger account ‘D 5 A’ does not reflect the 100M loan."
"As a result, the TAC rightly denied the Appellant's claim to deduct interest"
"expenses."
"Accordingly, I answer the first and second questions of law in the negative"
"in favour of the Respondent."
