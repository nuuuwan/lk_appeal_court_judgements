"In the volume titled Income Tax in Sri Lanka, Gooneratne states that:12"
"‘The principle is well established that where a tribunal arrives at a finding"
"which is not supported by evidence the finding though stated in the form of"
"a finding of fact is a finding which involves a question of law. The question"
"of law is whether there was evidence to support the finding, apart from the"
"adequacy of the evidence. The Court will interfere if the finding has been"
"reached without any evidence or upon a view of facts which could not be"
"reasonably entertained. The evidence can be examined to see whether the"
"Board  [being  the  Board  of  Review;  the  predecessor  of  the  TAC]  being"
"properly appraised of what they had to do could reasonably have arrived"
"at the conclusion they did.’"
"Hence,  in  determining  whether  the  TAC  erred  in  its  determination,  this"
"Court is required to examine whether there was sufficient evidence for the"
"TAC to arrive at its conclusion."
"Upon consideration of the document marked ‘D 5 A’, the ledger account"
"of  Samson  Rubber,  I  observe  that  there  are  four  entries  pertaining  to  a"
"100M loan. The first entry dated 30th April 2009; pertaining to the 100M"
"money market loan is a debit entry of Rs. 2, 608, 219.18. The second entry"
"dated 7th May 2009, 100M loan interest amounting to Rs. 2, 701,369. 86 is"
"also  a  debit  entry.  The  third  entry  dated  22nd  June  2009,  pertaining  to"
"the100M loan is a debit of Rs. 1, 304,109.59. The fourth entry dated 8th"
"June  2009  is  a  debit  entry  of  100M  loan  interest  amounting  to  Rs.  2,"
"980,821.92. These four entries correspond with the four debit notes ‘D 6’,"
"‘D  6  (1)’,  ‘D  6  (2)’  and  ‘D  6  (3)’,  issued  by  Samson  Rubber  to  the"
"Appellant. Although the Appellant submitted that the 100M  loan is also"
"reflected in ‘D 5 A’, no such entry is found and are only entries pertaining"
"to  the  interest  of  a  100M  loan.  However,  the  100M  loan  from  Samson"
"Rubber is shown in the financial statement of the Appellant company for"
"the year ending on the 31st March 201013. In any case, the debit entries in"
"‘D 5 A' relating to a 100 M loan do not concern the interest paid by the"
"Appellant.  If  it  were,  it  would  have  to  be  credit  entries,  a  receipt  from"
"Samson Tiles. Therefore, it is apparent that the entries for a 100M  loan"
