"of  meals  expenses,  as  required  by  Section  106  (13)  of  the  IR  Act48."
"However, as correctly submitted by the Appellant, Section 106(13) of the"
"IR Act does not place an onus on the Appellant to produce such documents."
"The  Section  empowers  an  Assessor  or  Assistant  Commissioner  to  give"
"written notice to the taxpayer to produce the necessary documents etc. No"
"doubt  a  taxpayer  has  a  duty  to  oblige.  Nevertheless,  there  is  no  burden"
"imposed upon the taxpayer by the Section itself. Therefore, in my view,"
"the TAC was mistaken in stating that Section 106(13) of the IR Act places"
"a  burden  on  the  Appellant  to  provide  documentation  to  support  meals"
"expenses.  Yet, in my view, the above misstatement has not affected the"
"final determination of the TAC on meals expenses. Although the Section"
"does not impose that burden, it is the Appellant who should displace the"
"assessment by providing the necessary evidence."

"taxpayer."

"‘When an Assessor, on the basis of his judgement makes an assessment, the"
"burden of showing that such an assessment is excessive is on the taxpayer."
"It  is for the  taxpayer  to substantiate  that the  Assessor had not  made  an"
"assessment to the best of his judgement. An Assessor is presumed to act in"
"good faith and reasonably, in arriving at a judgement of the profits and"
"income49.’"
"‘The  Burden  lies  on  the  taxpayer  to  disprove  the  correctness  of  the"
"estimated assessment and to establish a lower figure. Although the areas"
"of dispute may revolve around the reasons of the Assessor for making the"
"assessment, the onus of disproving the estimate will be on the taxpayer50.’"
"In the case of Gamini Bus Co. Ltd v. Commissioner of Income Tax51 (S.C.)"
"the following extract from the case of Guillain v. Commissioner of Income"
"Tax52 was cited;"
"'Where,  owing  to  the  unsatisfactory  nature  of  the  return  made  by  the"
"Assessee, the Assessor does not accept the return and makes an estimated"
