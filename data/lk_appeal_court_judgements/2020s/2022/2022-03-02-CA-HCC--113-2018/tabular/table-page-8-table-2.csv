"into the proceedings at any stage of the trial."
"In Moses v. Queen 75 NLR 121 the court held:"
"“Conviction  of  the  Appellant  must  be  quashed  on  the  ground  that  the"
"evidence of the previous conviction, which was inadmissible according"
"to section 54 of Evidence ordinance, had been taken into account in the"
"trial  judge’s  judgment  and  was  in  a  high  degree  prejudicial  to  the"
"Appellant. In such a case the substantial question is whether or not the"
"accused has been deprived of a fair trial”."
