"The Appellant giving evidence stated his qualifications and work experiences"
"in the field of education. Further he had said that he had rose to this position"
"with much sacrifices and difficulties. He also said that he has two daughters"
"who  had  had  their  education  in  Russia  and  that  the  elder  daughter  was"
"working as a doctor in Sri Lanka."
"The learned High Court judge in his judgment at page 771 of the brief has"
"described the Appellant as  a person who as a practice  request and  obtain"
"money to admit students to the school he works at. He further stated that"
"the defence evidence revealed that the Appellant had spent lots of money for"
"his  children’s’  costly  education  abroad  and  that  there  is  heavy  spending"
"which  goes  over  and  above  the  earnings  from  a  usual  government  salary."
"This adverse reference had totally been made by unsupported evidence and"
"are  assumptions  of  the  trial  judge.  Now  I  will  consider  how  this  reference"
"which  amounts  to  bad  character  of  the  Appellant  affects  the  fair  trial  and"
"prejudice the defence case."
"According to Section 53 of the Evidence Ordinance in criminal proceedings"
"the fact that the person accused is of a good character is relevant."
"According to Section 54 of the Evidence Ordinance in criminal proceedings"
"the fact that the person accused is of a bad character is irrelevant, unless"
"evidence  has  been  given  that  he  has  a  good  character,  in  which  case  it"
"becomes relevant."
"When the Character of the Appellant had not been put in issue during the"
"trial, the adverse reference made against the Appellant by the trial judge in"
"his  judgement  has  caused  a  serious  miscarriage  of  justice.  Further  the"
"adverse reference had been made by the trial judge on the unsupported and"
"uncorroborated evidence presented during the trial."
