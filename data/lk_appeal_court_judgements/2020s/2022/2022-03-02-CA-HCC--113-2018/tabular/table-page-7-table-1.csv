"E.R.S.R.Coomarasawamy  in  his  book  “The  Law  of  Evidence”  Volume  I  at"
"page 684 states that:"
"“The  principle  underlying  the  rule  is  that  hardship  is  possible,  as"
"evidence of bad character may lead the mind of the judge or jury away"
"from  the  point  to  be  decided,  namely,  the  guilt  or  innocence  of  the"
"accused  person  in  regard  to  the  particular  offence  with  which  he  is"
"charged. The main ground is prejudice”."
"In Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecution (1935) A.C. 309, Lord Sankey,"
"L.C. said:"
"“The mere fact that a man has been charged with an offence is no proof"
"that he committed the offence. Such a fact is, therefore irrelevant; it goes"
"neither to show that the prisoner did the acts for which he is actually"
"being tried nor does it go to his credibility as a witness. Such questions"
"must therefore, be excluded on the principle which is fundamental in the"
"law  of  evidence  as  conceived  in  this  country,  especially  in  criminal"
"cases, because if allowed, they are likely to lead the minds of the jury"
"astray into false issues; not merely do they trend to introduce suspicion"
"as if it were evidence, but they trend to distract the jury from the true"
"issue,  namely  whether  the  prisoner  in  fact  committed  the  offence  on"
