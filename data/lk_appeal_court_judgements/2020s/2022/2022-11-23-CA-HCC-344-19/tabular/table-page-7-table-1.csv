"not given evidence and stated that she made such complaints, and as"
"a 
result, 
IP  Samarathunga  had  animosity  with  her.  So-called"
"animosity  is  merely  a  suggestion  made  on  behalf  of  the  appellant."
"Therefore, the basic premise of the defense has not been presented in"
"a  plausible  manner.  This  matter  was  considered  not  because  the"
"appellant  had  a  burden  of  proving  anything.  It  is  sufficient  for  the"
"appellant 
to  create 
reasonable  doubt  on 
the  prosecution  case."
"However, there must be an acceptable basis in the defence version in"
"order to create reasonable doubt on the prosecution case."
"Furthermore, the two defence witnesses stated in their testimony that"
"they were arrested for no reason, and the defence version was that the"
"appellant was also arrested with them for no reason when they were"
"at 
“Bandaranayakapura.”  However, 
it 
transpired 
in 
the 
cross-"
"examination 
that  both  defence  witnesses  had  pleaded  guilty 
for"
"possession  of  heroin  when  they  were  at  “Meethotamulla”.  Although"
"they have given explanations like they pleaded guilty on the advice of"
"their lawyer, it is a fact that they themselves had pleaded guilty to the"
"heroin cases against them and were convicted. Now they cannot come"
"to this court and say that they were arrested with the appellant when"
"nothing was possessed by them. They also cannot say that they were"
"arrested  when 
they  were  at 
“Bandaranayakapura”  because 
they"
"pleaded 
guilty 
to 
possessing 
heroin 
when 
they 
were 
at"
"“Meethotamulla”.  Furthermore,  when  DW-3  was  cross-examined  in"
"this case, a contradictory portion of his statement made to the police"
"in the said heroin case, ""When I arrived, some police officers suddenly"
"came  near  the  ""Meethotamulla""  bus  station,  surrounded  me,  and"
"searched me,"" had been marked as X-5. Hence, the defence story that"
"three  of  them  were  arrested  at  “Bandaranayakapura”  for  no  reason"
"appears to be improbable. Considering the said circumstances, I am"
"of the view that the learned High Court Judge has correctly rejected"
"the defence witnesses’ evidence."
