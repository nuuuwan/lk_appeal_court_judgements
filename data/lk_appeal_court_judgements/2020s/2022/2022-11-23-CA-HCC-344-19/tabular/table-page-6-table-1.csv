"T
he second ground of appeal",""
"","The  vital  issue  to  be  considered  in  this  appeal  is  the  two  different"
"","versions  in  respect  of  the  raid,  presented  by  the  prosecution  and"
"","defence, and not the discrepancies regarding the information received."
"","In  dealing  with  that  issue,  it  has  to  be  considered  whether  defence"
"","evidence has been rejected on unreasonable grounds, as contended by"
"the learned counsel for the appellant.",""
"The 
learned  Senior  Deputy  Solicitor  General","for 
the  respondent"
"","contended that the learned High Court Judge had carefully considered"
"the  dock  statement  and","the  evidence  of  defence  witnesses  and"
"correctly rejected the same as the defence version was improbable.",""
"","It  is  needless  to  state  that  when  a  criminal  case  is  determined,  the"
"","evidence of the defence should be considered in the same manner as"
"","the evidence of the prosecution. The Supreme Court of India, held in"
"","the case of Dudh Nath Pandey vs The State Of U.P, decided on 11th"
"","February  1981,  reported  in  1981  AIR  911,  1981  SCR  (2)  771  that"
"","“defence  witnesses  are  entitled  to  equal  treatment  with  those  of  the"
"prosecution.  And,  Courts","ought 
to 
overcome 
their 
traditional,"
"","instinctive disbelief in defence witnesses. Quite often, they tell lies but"
"so do the prosecution witnesses”.",""
