"accidentally resulted on the deceased causing his death thereby attracting the plea of"
"a grave and sudden provocation and self-defence as embodied in special exceptions 1"
"and 3 to section 294 of the Penal Code."
"However,  had  the  trial  court  considered  the  above-mentioned  factors  in  its  correct  judicial"
"perspective, the trial court would have come to an accurate factual finding that the accused-"
"appellant caused the death of the deceased by accident upon being provoked by the deceased"
"consequently affording the plea of a grave and sudden provocation to the accused-appellant."
"Not only that, this court can consider the accused-appellant must have used his right of private"
"defence to protect himself when the deceased came to attack him."
"I  wish  to  say  that  the  failure  to  take  into  account  the  afore-cited  extenuating  circumstances"
"amounts to a non-direction resulting in a miscarriage of justice."
"In  this  case,  the  appellant  had  proved  the  right  of  private  defence  and  grave  and  sudden"
"provocation and sudden fight. Even though the accused had acted excessively when inflicting"
"the  said  injury  using  a  big  knife,  the  matters  already  discussed above  indicate  a  sudden fight"
"without premeditation and without taking any undue advantage in the heat of passion."
"For the reasons set out above, I conclude that the learned trial Judge had misdirected himself by"
"failing to evaluate the said material in favour of the accused-appellant. I, therefore, decide to set"
"aside  the  conviction  and  sentence  imposed  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Kalutara  on"
"15.12.2015  and  replace  it  with  a  conviction  for  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to  murder"
"under  section  297  of  the  Penal  Code  based  on  sudden  fight  and  self-defence  and  impose  a"
"sentence of rigorous imprisonment for 7 years."
"We  direct  that  the  sentence  should  take  effect  from  the  date  of  imposition.  Therefore,  the"
"sentence imposed should take effect from 15.12.2015."
"The appeal is allowed."
"Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment along with the main case record to the High"
"Court of Kalutara and a copy of the Judgement to the prison authorities forthwith."
