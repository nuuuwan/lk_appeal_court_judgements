"The Text Book on the Indian Penal Code by K.D. Gaur, Fourth Edition at pages 178 and 179 are"
"as follows;"
"“A man is justified in resisting by force anyone who manifestly intends and endeavours"
"by violence or surprise to commit a known felony against either his person, habitation or"
"property. In these cases, he is not obligated to retreat, and may not merely resist the"
"attack where he stands but may indeed pursue his adversary until the danger is ended"
"and if in a conflict between them, he happens to kill his attacker, such killing is justifiable.”"
"Chacko Mathai v State of Kerala AIR 1964 KER 222 was held as follows;"
"""The  right  of  private  defence  is  a  highly  prized  gift  granted  to  the  citizen  to  protect"
"themselves by effective self-resistance against unlawful aggression. No man is expected"
"to fly away when he is attacked. He could fight back and when he apprehends death or"
"grievous hurt could see that his adversary is vanquished without modulating his defence"
"step  by  step.  Faced  with  a  dangerous  adversary,  no  man  can  act  with  a  detached"
"reflection and under such circumstances, if he travels a little beyond the limit, the law"
"protects him and hence courts should not place more restrictions on him than the law"
"demands."""
