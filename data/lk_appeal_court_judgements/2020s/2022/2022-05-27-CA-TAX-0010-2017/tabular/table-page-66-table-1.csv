"29(2) of the IRA, No. 30 of 2000 or section 32 (5) of the IRA, No. 10 of"
"2006"
"[191]  The  next  question  is  to  consider  whether  the  interest  expenses"
"incurred  by 
the  Appellant 
to 
the  value  of  Rs.  52,479,103  and  Rs."
"122,406,640  is  deductible  in  determining  the  assessable  income  of  the"
"Appellant under Section 29 (2) of the IRA 2000 or Section 32 (5) of the IRA"
