"“incurred 
in  the  production  of  the  profits  or 
income”, 
the  word"
"“outgoing” is not limited by those words."
"[130] On the analysis of the facts and circumstances of the case, Basnayake,"
"C.J.,  held  that  while  the  loss  suffered  by  burglary  was  not  an  expense"
"incurred in producing the profits of the business, the loss was an outgoing"
"deductible  under  Section  9 
(1) 
in  ascertaining  the  profits  or 
income."
"Sinnetamby, J. In the same case, while agreeing that the word “outgoing” is"
"wider  than  the  term  “expense”,  stated  that 
it  must  not  be 
limited  to"
"voluntary payments, but would also include involuntary outgoings such as"
"petty theft by subordinates  (p. 177). Sinnetamby, J.  stated  however,  that"
"the  “outgoings”  must  be  of  such  a  nature  as  would  come  within  the"
"meaning of the expression “incurred in the production of profits” (supra)."
"Sinnetamby, 
J. 
  held  that  the 
loss  suffered  by  the  assessee  must  be"
"regarded  as 
incidental 
to 
the  assessee’s  business  and 
thus, 
it  was"
"deductible under Section 9 (1) of the Ordinance."
"[131] The only disagreement of the views expressed by Basnayake, C.J. and"
"Sinnetamby, J. related to the question whether or not the outgoings must"
"be limited by the words “incurred in the production of profits or income”."
"The  proposition  of  Basnayake,  C.J.  was  confirmed  by  the  Supreme  Court"
"decision 
in  Rodrigo  v.  Commissioner  of  Income  Tax  (supra)  where"
"Bandaranayake, J. (as she then was) with Sarath N. Silva, C.J. and Ismail, J."
"agreeing  interpreted  the  provisions  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act,  No.  38  of"
"2000 and observed at page 390:"
