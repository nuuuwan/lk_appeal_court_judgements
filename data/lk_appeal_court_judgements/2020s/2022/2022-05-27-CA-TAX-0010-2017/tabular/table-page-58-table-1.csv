"“Sections 23 (1) and 24 of the Act have to be read together as both"
"provisions apply to the deductibility from the income. While section 23"
"spells out the permissible expenses, section 24 expressly disallows the"
"whole or part of certain expenses, which if not so prohibited, would be"
"a
l
l
owable deductions. The combined effect of sections 23 and 24"
"therefore is to divide all outgoings and expenses into two categories;"
"outgoing expenses which are deductible and not deductible. ...(p. 391)"
"Taking both these Sections together, in their literal context, it appears"
"that the meanings of words in Section 23(1) is restricted by the words"
"g
i
ven in Section 24 (1) (g) of the Act”..(p. 392)."
