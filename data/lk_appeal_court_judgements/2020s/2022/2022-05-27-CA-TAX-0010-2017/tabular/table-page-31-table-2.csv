"organized  and  carried  on  systematically,  they  amount  to  a  business."
"Samarawickrema J. observed at pp. 477-478:"
"“Where the evidentiary material discloses the facts which I have set"
"out, it is not possible for this Court to hold that there is no evidence"
"to support a finding that the assessee’s betting activities amount to a"
"business. In point of fact the evidence amply supports such a finding."
"The order of the Board states: “The systematic and continuous way"
"the assessee had taken bets, the time and labour he had put into"
"them, the facilities he had built around himself to place these bets"
"and deposit the winnings clearly indicate that betting was a vocation"
"and his dominant intention was to gain money”."
