"to the organised trade/business activities, and not the individual activities"
"as follows:"
"“As I have said, there is no doubt that one might create a trade by"
"making an organized effort to obtain emoluments which are not in"
"themselves taxable as profits, and the most familiar instance of all, of"
"course, is a trade which has for its object the securing of capital"
"i
ncrement. A person who buys an object which subsequently turns"
"out to be worth more than he gave for it, and which he sells, does not"
"thereby make a profit or gain for income tax purposes. But he can"
"organize himself to do that in a commercial and mercantile way, and"
"the profits, which emerge are taxable profits, not of the transaction,"
"both of the trade. In the same way, he may carry on the trade of"
"selling things which he has not got and buying them when the price"
"has fallen. That is a capital accretion, only the operations are"
"reversed. He sells first and buys afterwards. And in that way, he may"
"make losses or he may make profits. If he makes losses, the losses"
"cannot be said to be the results of the individual acts; they are the"
"results of the trade as a whole. Test it in this way. A person may"
"organize an effort to find things. He may start a salvage or exploring"
"undertaking and he may make profits. The profits are not the profits"
"o
f
 
the findings, they are the profits of the adventure as a whole. Again,"
"he may make a loss. One cannot say that the loss was due to the"
"failure to find. The loss is due to the trade. That is a good test, because"
"i
t
 shows the difference between the trade as an organism and the"
"i
ndividual acts”."
