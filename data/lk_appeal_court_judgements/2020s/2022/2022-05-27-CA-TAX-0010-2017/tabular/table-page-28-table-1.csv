ts business may be quiescent, and, to a large extent, a matter of"
"","routine. Its receipts may be derived, if not wholly, at least almost"
"","entirely from the annual payments made to it by the Secretary of State;"
"","but it remains a company alive, and still requiring, if only in smaller"
"","details, the direction of its directors and the duties carried out by its"
