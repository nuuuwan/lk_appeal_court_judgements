"from the failure of the Commission to make the determination within the"
"time limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act."
"[48]  Any  procedural  retrospective  operation  of  a  provision,  in  my  view,"
"cannot  take  away  the  rights  of  parties  who  have  no  control  over  those"
"entrusted  with  the  duty  of  making  determination  within  the  time  limit"
"specified in Section 10. The retrospective operation of Section 10 without"
"any penal or  other consequence of  non-compliance, by itself,  cannot be"
"treated  as  a  factor  in  determining  that  the  legislature  intended  that  the"
"failure to adhere to the time limit specified in Section 10 is mandatory."
"Consequences  of  non-compliance  of  a  statute  by  those  entrusted"
"with public duty"
"[49]  One  of  the 
important  factors  that 
is  necessary  for  determining"
"whether  a  provision 
is  mandatory  or  directory 
is  to  find  as  to  who"
"breached the time limit specified in Section 10-whether it was breached by"
"one of the parties to the action or by those entrusted with the performance"
"of a public duty. Also coming under this head are cases where the Court"
"will  take  into  account  the  practical  inconveniences  or  impossibilities  of"
"holding a time limit requirement to be mandatory where the public duty is"
"performed  by  a  public  body.  If  the  statutory  provision  relates  to  the"
"performance of a public duty, the Court is obliged to consider whether any"
"consequence of such breach would work serious public inconvenience, or"
"injustice to the parties who have no control over those entrusted with such"
"public duty."
"[50]  Apart  from  the  absence  of  reference  to  penal  sanction  and  other"
"consequences  of  non-compliance  of  Section  10, 
the 
impossibility  of"
"adhering to the time limit provision is also a factor in influencing the court"
"to construe the time limit provision is not mandatory, but as directory only."
"As  noted, 
the  pending  appeals  were 
transferred 
to 
the  properly"
"constituted  Tax  Appeals  Commission  after  the  amendment  to  Section  2"
"was enacted by the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of"
"2012 which came into effect on 15.02.2012. A perusal of the record (p. 34)"
"reveals that the appeal was first fixed for hearing on 17.10.2013 and the"
"appeal was first held by the Tax Appeals Commission consisting of Justice"
