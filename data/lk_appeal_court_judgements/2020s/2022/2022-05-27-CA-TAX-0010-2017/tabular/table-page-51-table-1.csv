"things  as  they  signify  according  to  their  natural  import,  but  also  those"
"things  which  the  interpretation  clause  declares  that  they  shall  include"
"(Commissioner of Inland Tax v. Banddarawathie Fernando Charitable"
"Trusts  (63  N.L.R  409).  It  is  no  doubt  true  that  generally,  when  the  word"
"""include"" is used in a definition clause, -it is used as a word of enlargement,"
"that is to make the definition extensive and not restrictive"
