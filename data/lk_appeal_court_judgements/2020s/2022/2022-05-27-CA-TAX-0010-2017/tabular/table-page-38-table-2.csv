"[110]  In ICICI Bank v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue  (supra),"
"Dehideniya, J. stated at p. 9:"
"“As I have mentioned earlier, the Appellant has disregarded the law."
"Section 106(11) of the IRA imposes a duty cast upon the Respondent"
"to maintain separate accounts, when it became necessary. Even"
"though the Appellant has not produced any document or a separate"
"account in this case, the Appellant stated at the inquiry that they are"
"keeping all the data in their computers. Still, they failed to submit"
"them at the inquiry. Without conducting the business as required by"
"l
aw, the Appellant cannot be heard to say that the system adopted"
"by the Commissioner is arbitrary, and the opinion of this court is that"
"i
t
 
i
s
 
not bad in law”. (emphasis added)"
