"In Luvis v. The Queen 56 NLR 442 the court held that:"
"“Having  regard  to  the  evidence,  the  fact  that  sudden  fight  was  not"
"specifically  raised  as  a  defence  did  not  relieve  the  trial  judge  of  the"
"duty of placing before the jury that aspect of the case.”"
"Considering all the circumstances stressed before this court I conclude that"
"this  is  an  appropriate  case  to  consider  for  the  Appellant’s  benefit,  his"
"entitlement for a plea of sudden fight under Exception-4 to Section 294 of"
"the Penal Code."
"Hence, I set aside the death sentence and convict the Appellant for culpable"
"homicide not amounting to murder under Section 297 of the Penal Code. I"
"sentence  the  Appellant  for  10  years  rigorous  imprisonment  commencing"
"from the date of conviction namely 22/11/2017."
"Subject to the above variation the appeal is dismissed."
"The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High Court of"
"Gampaha along with the original case record."
