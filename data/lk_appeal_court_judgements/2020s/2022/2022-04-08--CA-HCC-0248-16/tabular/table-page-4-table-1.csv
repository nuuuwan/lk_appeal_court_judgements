"Milroy  has  identified  him  as  Roshan.  On  his  orders,  sergeant  Rajapakse  and"
"sergeant Turin have stopped the person. He has observed that he was shivering"
"and sweating profusely when they approached and questioned him."
"In Court, PW-01 has identified the said person as the appellant. The appellant"
"has been searched by sergeant Rajapakse and a parcel has been recovered from"
"the waist of the short he was wearing underneath of his sarong. The parcel had"
"two pink coloured polythene covers. In one cover he has found 30 small folded"
"aluminum foil wrappers and in the other cover 50 similar folded foil wrappers."
"When he opened one of the folded  wrappers,  he has observed brown coloured"
"powder which he has identified as heroin through his long experience as a police"
"officer."
"After taking the production under his custody, he has arrested the appellant at"
"1900 Hours, after informing him of the charges against him. Subsequently, he"
"has travelled to a jewellery shop near Marawila town mosque in order to weigh"
"the quantity of heroin found in the custody of the appellant. After separating the"
"aluminum  foil  wrappers,  PW-01  has  weighed  the  content  using  the  electronic"
"scale that was available at the jewellery store and has found the brown-coloured"
"powder  contained  4  grams  and  390  milligrams.  After  taking  steps  to  record  a"
"statement from the owner of the shop, the productions have been sealed using"
"his  personal  seal  and  left-hand  thumb  impression  of  the  appellant.  Later,  the"
"productions  and  the  appellant  have  been  handed  over  to  Marawila  police  for"
"further investigations."
"In his evidence, PW-01 has correctly explained the procedure he followed after"
"the  arrest  and  has  identified  the  productions  found  in  the  possession  of  the"
"appellant."
"The stand of the appellant when the PW-01 gave his evidence had been that this"
"was  a  false  accusation  against  him  and  the  witness  was  lying  in  that  regard."
"However, the witness has denied that allegation."
