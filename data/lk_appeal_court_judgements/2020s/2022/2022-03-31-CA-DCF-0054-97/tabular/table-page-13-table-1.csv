"I
n considering the aforementioned boundaries of Siyambalagahamula Watta and lots 1 and 2 of"
"the  preliminary  plan  number  717/Kuli/82,  it  is  clear  that  lots  1  and  2  can  be  considered  as"
"Siyambalagahamula Watta and hence there is no barrier for the plaintiff-respondent to seek for"
"a partition of lots 1 and 2 disregarding the position and the entitlement of the appellants about"
"the  properties  surveyed  for  the  said  partition  action.  There  is  no  legal  restriction  to  enter  a"
"partition judgment in considering the variable stands taken up by the plaintiff-respondent about"
"the corpus. Because of the strong defence taken up on behalf of the appellants stating that the"
"property  surveyed  by  the  preliminary  plan  is  not  larger  than  the  actual  extent  of  those  lands"
"described  in  the  schedule  to  the  3rd  amended  plaint  as  well  as  for  the  fact  that  the  plaintiff-"
"respondent has established the 4 boundaries at least of the Siyabalagahamula Watta which the"
"plaintiff-respondent finally restricted to partition by this partition action."
"The defendant-appellants state that if any partition decree is entered and divided lots 1 and 2 of"
"preliminary plan number 717/Kuli/82, grave injustice and irreparable damage would be caused"
"to the appellants and they will lose their entitlements to those properties which they become"
"entitled to, as mentioned in their statement of claims specially  because the issues 5 to 17 raised"
"on behalf of the appellants had taken up the apparent discrepancies and errors in the pleadings"
"of the plaintiff-respondent. I do not agree with the said argument of the defendant-appellants"
"and  all  parties  can  claim  their  rights  when  partitioning  lot  1  and  2  of  the  preliminary  plan,"
"according to the partition act."
"In the above said circumstances, we set aside the judgment dated 27.02.1997 and re-calculate"
"the shares of the land in accordance with the pedigrees tendered by both parties."
