"boundaries of lots 1 and 2 are not compatible with the following boundaries given in respect of"
"lots 1 and 2 of preliminary plan number 717/Kuli/82 which is at page 126."
"Boundaries  given  in  the  schedule  of  Siyambalagahamula  Watta  in  the  amended  plaint  dated"
"11.02.1993 are as follows;"
