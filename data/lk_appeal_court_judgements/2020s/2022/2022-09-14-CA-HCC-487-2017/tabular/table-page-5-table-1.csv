"Government Analyst stated that Mrs Navaratne, Assistant Government Analyst,"
"issued  the  receipt.    PW  7  received  the  productions  marked  M1,  M2,  M3,  M4"
"and      M5,    with  the  seals  on  the  same  day,  that  is  on  14th  June  2014.  This"
"evidence  was  not  challenged  in  the  cross-examination;  therefore,  the  second"
"ground of appeal lacks substance and merit."
"The  appeal  is  clearly  out  of  time  and  the  appellant  had  absconded  court"
"proceedings. Even considering carefully the facts of this case, we can see that"
"there is no merit in the appeal."
"Considering  the  above  there  is  no  reason  to  interfere  with  the  findings  of  the"
"learned High Court judge."
"We affirm the conviction and the sentence dated 29.04.2015."
"Therefore, the appeal is dismissed."
