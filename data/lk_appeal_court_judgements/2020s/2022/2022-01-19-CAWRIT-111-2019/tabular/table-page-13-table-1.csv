"the  means  they  employ  to  achieve  those  goals,  so  that  his  action"
"impinges on the individual rights to the minimum extent to preserve"
"the public interest [vide Council of Civil Services Unions v. Minister"
"for  the  Civil  Services [1984]  UKHL  9  -  per  Lord  Diplock].  By"
"“proportionality”, we also mean the question whether, while regulating"
"exercise  of 
individual’s  rights,  the  appropriate  or 
least-restrictive"
"choice  of  measures  has  been  made  by 
the 
legislature  or 
the"
"administrator  so  as  to  achieve  the  object  of  the  legislation  or  the"
"purpose  of  the  administrative  order,  as  the  case  maybe.  Under  this"
"principle, the court will see that the legislature or the administrative"
"authority  “maintain  a  proper  balance  between  the  adverse  effects"
"which the legislation or the administrative order may have on the rights,"
"liberties or interests of persons keeping in mind the purpose which they"
"legislature  and 
the  administrative 
were 
intended 
to  serve”.  The"
"authority are, however, given an area of discretion or a range of choices"
"but as to whether the choice made infringes the rights excessively or"
"(2001) 
not 
is 
for 
the  court 
[vide  Om Kumar v. Union of India"
"2 SCC 386, at para 28]."
"Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of this case, I cannot bring"
"myself to conclude that the decision of the 1st Respondent to recruit"
"the  12th  Respondent  to  the  said  post  is  patently  unreasonable  or"
"perverse."
"The Petitioner principally, sought to quash the appointment of the 12th"
"Respondent as the Assistant Director (Personal) of the 1st Respondent."
"The Petitioner also sought writs of mandamus directing the 1st to 7th"
"Respondents 
to 
formulate  and  obtain 
the  approval  of 
the  14th"
"Respondent  for  the  Scheme  of  Recruitment,  relevant  for  the  post  of"
"Assistant Director (Personal) and directing the 1st to 7th Respondents"
"to advertise and call for applications for the post of Assistant Director"
"(Personal),  afresh, 
in  accordance  with  a  Scheme  of  Recruitment"
"approved by the 14th Respondent. In my view, if the instant application"
"is allowed, a serious injustice would be caused to the 12th Respondent"
