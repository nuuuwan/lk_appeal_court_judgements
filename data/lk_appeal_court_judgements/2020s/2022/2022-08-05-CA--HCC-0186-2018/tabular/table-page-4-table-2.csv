"Professor G. L. Peiris in his book “Offences under the Penal Code of Sri"
"Lanka” at page 222 states:"

"issue, a conviction of rape will be upheld only in circumstances where"
"the  prosecution  has  succeeded  in  establishing  absence  of  consent"

"of the prosecution is necessarily incomplete. Consequently, no burden"
"devolves  on  the  defence  in  these  circumstances.  Any  departure  from"
"this position culminates in a miscarriage of justice”."
