"The  learned  Trial  Judge  observed  that  the  accused-appellant  was  not  having  a  murderous"
"intention. I do agree with that as there was no evidence to prove it was a pre-planned murder."
"The accused-appellant argued with the deceasedâ€™s son."
"In the case of Farook vs. AG 2006 (3) SLR 174, it was stated as follows;"
"""As regards the attempt to bring the case to one of culpable homicide not amounting"
"to murder mainly on the basis that there is no intention to cause death."""
"In  Ariyadasa  vs.  AG 2012  (1)  SLR  84  it  was  held,  that  the  prosecution  must  prove that the"
"injury is sufficient to cause the death in the ordinary course of nature among the following"
"facts;"
"(i) 
It must establish quite objectively that a bodily injury is present."
"(ii)  The nature of the injury must be proved. These are purely objective investigations."
"(iii) 
It must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular body injury."
"(iv)  That is to say that it was not accidental or unintended or some other kind of injury"
"was intended."
"Once the aforesaid 4 elements are established only, then the offence of murder under section"
"294 is established. If the prosecution was not able to prove even a single condition amongst"
"the above, then the offence of murder will not be proved."
"The first limb in section 294 states that culpable homicide is murder if the act in which death"
"is caused is done to cause death. The second limb deals with acts done with the intention of"
"causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person"
"to whom, that harm is caused. The third limb discards the  test of subjective knowledge. It"
"deals with acts done to cause bodily injury to a person and the bodily injury intended to be"
"inflicted 
is  sufficient 
in  the  ordinary  course  of  nature  to  cause  death.  The  fourth 
limb"
"comprehends  generally,  the  commission  of  imminently  dangerous  acts  which  must  in  all"
"probability cause death."
"Per Soertsz J in  R v Chandrasekera 44 NLR 97, Where ""by involving the fact in issue in sufficient"
"doubt  the  accused  ipso  facto  involves  in  such  doubt  an  element  of  the  offence  that  the"
"prosecution had to prove ....... In such a case the proper view seems to me to be that the"
"accused  succeeds  in  avoiding  the  charge  of  murder,  not  because  he  has  established  his"
"defence  but  because  by  involving  the  essential  elements  of 
intention  in  doubt,  he  has"
"produced the result that the prosecution has not established a necessary part of its case. """
"When this matter was taken up for argument the learned counsel for the accused-appellant"
"submitted that he is not challenging the conviction. As the learned Trial Judge was convicted"
"for  murder,  the  indictment  was  amended  on  the  04.12.2014,  for  the  offence  of  culpable"
"homicide not amounting to murder, under section 297 of the Penal Code. The learned counsel"
"for  the  appellant  and  the  respondent  requested  for  a  lessor  punishment  as  the  accused-"
"appellant did not have any intention or motive to inflict injury. It is evident that the important"
"facts were not considered by the learned Trial Judge on convicting the accused-appellant of"
"the murder charge."
