udgement"
"The Petitioner is seeking for injunctions under and in terms of Article 143 of the Constitution of"
"the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, preventing the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents from"
"taking  any  steps  to  encash  the  bank  guarantees  marked  X3A  -  X3B  and  preventing  7th  –  10th"
"Respondents from taking steps to encash the same bank guarantees and such other interim reliefs"
"prayed for in the petition."
"The Petitioner which is a limited liability Company, had entered into a contract with the Ministry"
"of Urban Development, Water Supplies and Housing Facilities which is marked as X2. Thereafter,"
"the Petitioner Company had started the construction work in pursuant to the contract. It appears"
"that there had been a delay of performance under the contract and after several correspondence"
"between the two parties, the secretary to the Ministry had terminated the contract as evidenced by"
"the letter marked X8. The main submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that, the"
"aforesaid termination of the contract is illegal. He submitted that the contract was entered between"
"the  Petitioner  Company  and  the  Ministry  of  Urban  Development,  Water  Supply  and  Housing"
"Facilities and the secretary of the Ministry is not authorized to terminate the said contract. It was"
"his submission that the approval of the Minister in charge of the subject, was never obtained before"
"the termination."

"Dr. Ranaraja J has observed as follows, “When a bank has given a guarantee, it is required to honor"
"it according to its terms and is not concerned whether either party to the contract which underlay"
"the contract was in default. The whole purpose of such commercial instruments was to provide"
"security  which  was  to  be  readily,  promptly  and  assuredly  realisable  when  the  prescribed  event"
"occurred. The only exception to the rule is where fraud by one of the parties to the underlying"
"contract has been established and the bank had notice of the fraud. A mere plea of fraud would in"
"for the purpose of brining the case within this exception and which rests in the uncorroborated"
"statements of the applicant will not suffice.” In that judgement Dr. Ranaraja J further observed as"
"follows, “It is only in exceptional circumstances that Courts will interfere with the machinery of"
"obligations  assumed  by  the  banks.  They  are  the  lifeblood  of  international  commerce.  Such"
"obligations are regarded as collateral to underlying rights and obligations between merchants at"
"either end of the banking chain. Courts will leave the merchants to settle their disputes under the"
"contract by litigation.”"
"The  same  principle  was  accepted  by  S.N  Silva  J  in  Indica  Traders  (Pvt)  Limited  Vs.  Seoul"
"Lanka  Constructions  (Pvt)  Limited  and  others  (1994)  3  SLR  387.  In  this  case,  there  is  no"
"evidence of fraud on the part of the Respondents and there is no evidence that the Respondents"
