"the  appellant  by  PW-02  becomes  highly  unreliable 
to  act  on 
that  alone,"
"because,  by  the  time  the  statement  was  recorded  the  appellant  was  under"
"arrest.  Under  the  circumstances,  it  may  also  be  possible  that  the  PW-02’s"
"identification  of  the  appellant  may  have  been  influenced  by  the  fact  of  the"
"appellant being in the custody of the police. The only way to eliminate such a"
"doubt  would  have  been  to  call  the  PW-01  to  give  evidence  and  establish  that"
"his wife informed him the identity of the person who came and it was he who"
"informed  it  to  the  police  in  his  first  information.  I  find  that  this  failure  was  a"
"fatal  error  by  the  prosecution  that  goes  into  the  root  of  the  credibility  of  the"
"only eyewitness of the case."
"It  is  well  established  law  that  an  accused  has  nothing  to  prove  in  a  criminal"
"case and it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable"
"doubt. Hence, however much poor the case put forward by the defence is, it is"
"not  a  reason  to  consider  that 
fact 
in 
favour  of  the  prosecution  and  the"
"prosecution’s  duty  of  proving  the  case  beyond  reasonable  doubt  remains  the"
"same."
"For the aforementioned reasons, I find that this is a conviction that cannot be"
"allowed  to  stand  as 
it 
is  not  safe  to  convict  the  appellant  based  on  the"
"testimony  of  the  sole  eyewitness  who  gave  evidence  in  the  matter  as  to  the"
"identification of the appellant."
"Therefore, 
I  set  aside 
the  conviction  and 
the  sentence 
imposed  on 
the"
"appellant. The appellant is acquitted from the charges preferred against him."
"Appeal allowed."
