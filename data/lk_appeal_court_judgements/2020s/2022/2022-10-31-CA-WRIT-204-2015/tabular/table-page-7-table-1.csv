"However, as the Petitioner had been having the beer shop for years in the present location despite"
"the objection of the community, it had been recommended to shift the said business to a suitable"
"location. This resulted in the Petitioner receiving the letter dated 10.01.12 (P5), whereby the"
"Petitioner had been given 6 months to find an alternative location. This Court also observes, the"
"Petitioner has failed to demonstrate to this Court that she had objected to the decision marked in"
"P5   at   the   time   it   was   made,   as   she   has   failed   to   demonstrate   of   such   objection   or   of   any"
"documentary proof of such an objection. The Petitioner had not challenged this decision and for"
"the   first   time   has   sought   to   challenge   this   decision   in   this   application   by   seeking   a   writ   of"
"certiorari to quash the said decision. It is observed by this Court, that the Petitioner had finally"
"sought to quash this decision only after a lapse of two years and three months. This clearly"
"demonstrates laches on the part of the Petitioner. Thus, in our view, prayer (f) of the Petitioner"
"has to fail due to undue delay."
"The   Petitioner  had   subsequently  sent  a   letter  dated  23.05.12  (R3)  where  it   is   apparent   that,"
"subject to her being asked to shift the location of the beer shop, she had been given the license"
"only for a period of six months for the year 2012. By the said letter, the Petitioner had requested"
"for her to be given the license for the remaining six months of the year as she had failed to find a"
"suitable site for relocation. As contended by the Respondents, this letter demonstrates that the"
"Petitioner had acquiesced to the decision in P5 as she had attempted to find a suitable place for"
"relocation.   This   letter   does   not   demonstrate   that   she   had   made   the   request   for   shifting   the"
"premises   under   protest.   This   request   of   the   Petitioner   had   been   accommodated   by   the   1st"
"Respondent by letter dated 21.06.12 (R7) where her license had been extended till 30.09.12. As"
"per the documents tendered to this Court, it appears that the Petitioner had failed to relocate but"
"had been continuing with her business in the same location till the year 2013 despite the public"
"protest. This resulted in the Respondents sending the letter dated 27.06.13 (P6), whereby the 1 st"
"Respondent had informed that the Petitioner’s permit would not be extended any further. The"
"Petitioner   had   failed   to   challenge   this   letter   too.   The   sequence   of   these   events   clearly"
"demonstrates that the decision to request the Petitioner to shift her premises had not been taken"
"suddenly and arbitrarily as contemplated by the Petitioner. Due to the public protest, there had"
"been an inquiry, to which all relevant parties including the Petitioner had been summoned and"
"the Petitioner’s representative had been present. Further as stated earlier, the Petitioner without"
