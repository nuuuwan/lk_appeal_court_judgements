"The learned High Court Judge has rightly drawn his attention to the Rule"
"No. 3 (1) (a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate) Procedure Rules 1990, which"
"reads thus;"
"“Every  Application  made  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  for  the  exercise  of  the  powers"
"vested in the Court of Appeal by Article 140 or 141 of the Constitution shall be by"
"way of petition, together with an affidavit in support of the averments therein, and"
"shall be accompanied by the originals of documents material to such Application"
"(or duly certified copies thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a Petitioner is unable"
"to tender any such document, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek"
"the leave of the Court to furnish such document later. Where a Petitioner fails to"
"comply  with  the  provisions  of  this  rule  the  Court  may,  ex-  mero  motu  or  at  the"
"instance of any party, dismiss such Application.”"
