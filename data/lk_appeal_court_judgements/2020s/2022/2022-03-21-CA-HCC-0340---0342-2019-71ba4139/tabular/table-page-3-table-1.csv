"2.  Facts in brief:"
"As  per  the  evidence  of  the  prosecution  witness  CI  Nuwan  Danthanarayana"
"(PW1), who conducted the raid, he had received the information from a private"
"informant, that heroin is being packed in a flat situated on the 3rd floor of the"
"Armour Street flats. Upon receiving the said information at about 2220 hours,"
"he  had  got  more  police  officers  ready  for  the  raid,  other  than  the  PC77375"
"Chandima  who  was  already  with  him.  With  the  other  officers,  he  had  slowly"
"climbed the steps up to the 3rd floor of the flat. After placing the other officers"
"at  different  points  he  had  gone  towards  the  particular  flat  with  police  officer"
"Bandara (PW3).  He had  crouched  along  the  corridor  on the  3rd floor  towards"
"the flat in a manner that they would not be visible to outsiders. Upon reaching"
"the particular flat as per the information received, he has found the main door"
"closed. He has observed inside the flat through a window, to see three persons"
"seated on the floor packing heroin. The lights had not been switched on inside"
"the  flat  and  the  three  persons  had  been  packing  the  heroin  using  candlelight."
"Both the officers, PW1 and PW3 had been observing the three people by taking"
"turns looking through the window for one and a half hours. After about one and"
"a  half  hours,  PW1  had  heard  the  noise  of  a  three-wheeler  approaching  the"
"ground floor of the flat. Thinking that the three-wheeler has come to collect the"
"heroin, he has soon decided to proceed with the raid. He had gone to the main"
"door  of  the  flat  and  asked  the  occupants  in  Tamil  language  to  open  the  door."
"When  the  door  was  opened,  they  have  pushed  the  door  inside  and  forcibly"
"entered the flat. The three occupants (appellants) had tried to escape. However,"
"with the assistance of  all the police  officers, they have arrested the  appellants"
"with  the  two  hundred  packs  of  heroin  and  the  other  implements  used  for  the"
"packing."
"3.  After the close of the prosecution case, all three appellants have made unsworn"
"statements from the dock stating that they were arrested on the road and heroin"
"was introduced."
