"It is important to note that PW 4 stated in his evidence that the  accused had come to the"
"place where they were consuming liquor and stated as follows;"
"“එො කිව්වා යේබිව මැරුවා කිෙලා. (page 174)”"
"“තමා විසන් යේබිට පිහියෙන් ඇන්න බව ප්‍රකාශ කර සටිො බණ්ඩාර විසන් (page 196)”"
"“මම යේබිට පිහියෙන් ඇන්නා කිො කිව්වා (page 196)”"
"However, the clause 'stabbed by a knife' has been marked as a contradiction on page 200 of"
"the appeal brief."
"'Confession' described in section 17 (2) of the Evidence Ordinance is as follows;"
"‘A  confession is  an  admission  made  at any  time by a  person  accused  of an offence"
"stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence.’"
"Confessions may be either judicial or extra-judicial. Extra-judicial confessions are confessions"
"that  are  not  made  before  a  Magistrate  or  in  Court  but  elsewhere.  In  the  present  case,"
"according to PW 4, the confession had been made to him by the accused-appellant. However,"
"PW 4 had revealed the said confession only after 3 months from the incident. PW 4 had gone"
"to the police station for another case and at that time the mother of the deceased had shown"
"PW 4 to the police officers."
"Only  PW  4  has  revealed  the  said  confession  to  the  police  officers.  As  per  the  said"
"circumstances, a reasonable doubt has arisen whether the revelation of the confession by PW"
"4 is voluntary or not. As per the evidence of PW 4, he had informed about the said confession"
"to a sister of the accused and a well-reputed person in the village. However, the prosecution"
"had not called any of them to establish the said fact."
"According to E.R.S.R Coomaraswamy, The Law of Evidence, Vol I page 395, before a confession"
"can be acted upon by a Court, it must satisfy the following tests;"
"Test of voluntariness."
"Test of truth."
"Test of sufficiency."
"As  per  the  evidence  of  PW  4,  the  accused  made  the  said  confession  as  soon  as  he  had"
"murdered the deceased. The accused had come with the same clothes which he was wearing"
"before he had left the place where they were consuming liquor to meet with the deceased."
"As per the evidence of PW4, the accused came back to the place where they were consuming"
"liquor within 30-60 minutes and he  had stated that he did not see any bloodstains on the"
"accused's clothes."
"Page 197 and 198 of the appeal brief is as follows;"
"ප්‍ර  :  බණ්ඩාරයේ ඇයේ තුවාල ලකුණු තිබුයණ් නැහැ යන්ද?"
"උ  :  නැහැ."
"ප්‍ර  :  ෂර්ට් එක ඉරිලා තිබුයණ් නැහැ යන්ද?"
