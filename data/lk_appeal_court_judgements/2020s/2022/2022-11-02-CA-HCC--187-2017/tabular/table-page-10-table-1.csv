"ir  John  Woodroffe  and  Syed  Amir  Ali  (Law  of  Evidence  20th    edition,  Vol.  4"
"page 5171) says that,"
"â€œIt is true that there is no rule of law that uncorroborated testimony of one"
"witness  cannot  be  accepted.  If  there  is  any  such  rule,  it  is  the  rule  of"
"prudence, and whether the rule should be adopted or not, will depend on"
"the  circumstances  of  each  case.  Whether 
the  general  rule  should  be"
"adopted  or  not  depend  on  the  circumstances  of  each  case.  As  a  general"
"rule a court can and may act on the testimony of a single witness though"
"uncorroborated.  Unless  corroboration  is  insisted  upon  by  a  statute,  the"
"court should not insist on corroboration except in the cases where nature of"
"testimony  of  single  witness 
itself  requires  corroboration.  One  credible"
"witness outweighs any number of other witnesses. In an appropriate case,"
"conviction  can  be  founded  on  solitary  testimony  of  a  witness  but  court"
"must  be  satisfied  that  the  evidence  of  the  witness,  which  it  is  asked  to"
"accept,  is  wholly  true.  In  a  murder  case,  conviction  can  be  based  on  the"
"testimony of sole eyewitness. The test is whether the evidence has a ring"
