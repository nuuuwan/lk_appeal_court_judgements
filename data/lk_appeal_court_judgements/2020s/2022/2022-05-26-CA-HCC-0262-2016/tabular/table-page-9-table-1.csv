"","Grounds of Appeal"
"At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated",""
"the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.",""
"","(1) The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the defence witnesses"
"","on the same yardstick he considered the prosecution witnesses."
"","(2) The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  was  misdirected  by  his 
failure  to"
"","address  the  fact  that  the  circumstantial  evidence  relied  on  by  the"
"","prosecution  could  have  been  easily 
introduced  by  the  police  and"
"","depending  on  such  circumstantial  evidence  was  not  safe.  Hence,  the"
"","conviction was bad in law."
"","(3) The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  was  misdirected  by  his 
failure  to"
"","consider  the  material  contradictions  in  respect  of  the  custody  of  the"
"","productions  that  were  sent  to  DNA  analysis  and  therefore,  admitting"
"","such evidence was bad in law."
"As the first ground of appeal urged is a one that needs to be considered last, I",""
"would now proceed to consider the 2nd and the 3rd grounds of appeal urged to",""
"find whether there is merit in the same.",""
"This","is  a  matter  that  has  been  decided  entirely  based  on  circumstantial"
"evidence  and  evidence  produced","in 
terms  of  section  27  of 
the  Evidence"
"Ordinance  as  there  had  been  no  eye  witness  evidence  as  to  the  manner  the",""
"deceased  received  his  injuries.  It  is  clear  from  the  judgment  that  the  learned",""
"High  Court  Judge  was  well  possessed  of  the  way  any  circumstantial  evidence",""
"should  be  considered  before  a  Court  of  law.  I  find  that  before  proceeding  to",""
"evaluate the evidence the learned High Court Judge has addressed his mind to",""
"the  legal  principle  that  presumption  of  innocence  is  always  with  an  accused",""
"until  proven  beyond  reasonable  doubt  the  charge  or  the  charges  against  him,",""
"and also the value that can be attached to a dock statement and the evidence",""
