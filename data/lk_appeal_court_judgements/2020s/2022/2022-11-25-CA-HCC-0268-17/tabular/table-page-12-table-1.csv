"evidence of PW-01. I do not find any reasons to disagree with the observations of"
"the  learned  High  Court  Judge  about  the  evidence  of  PW-07  and  08  for  the"
"reasons mentioned above."
"I am not in a position to agree with the contention of the learned Counsel for the"
"appellant  that  the  prosecution  has  marked  through  the  appellant  certain"
"portions of his statement to police which are confessionary in nature, and it has"
"caused prejudice to him. The learned High Court Judge has well considered the"
"portions of the statement marked when the appellant gave evidence before the"
"trial  court  and  has  come  to  a  conclusion  that  the  defence  put  forward  by  the"
"appellant has not created a doubt in the prosecution case nor it has offered a"
"reasonable  explanation.  I  do  not  find  any  part  of  the  said  markings  by  the"
"prosecution that can be considered confessionary in nature, given the fact that"
"they are actually admitted facts by the appellant in his evidence."
"For the reasons as considered above, I find no basis for the grounds of appeal"
"urged on behalf of the appellant as they are devoid of any merit."
"Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The conviction and the sentence affirmed."
