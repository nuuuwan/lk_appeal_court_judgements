"demanded  and  started  harassing  her  asking  for  a  gratification  of  Rs.  10000/-"
"claiming that the principal had been asking for the said sum of money."
"Although she has attempted to avoid the appellant, the appellant has continued"
"to demand the money. After seeking some advice on the issue faced by her, she"
"had made a complaint to the Bribery Commission on 22nd February 2006 which"
"has resulted in the raid conducted on 23rd February 2006."
"On the day where this incident has occurred, PW-01 accompanied by the decoy"
"(PW-02) has gone to the Circuit Education Office to meet the appellant and has"
"met  him  in  front  of  the  office.  After  coming  near  the  security  post  where  the"
"appellant was posted, he has accepted the money. It was the evidence of PW-01"
"that  when  she  first  met  the  appellant  in  front  of  the  education  office,  he"
"questioned  her  asking  “වැඩේ  හරිද?”,  which  was  a  reference  to  the  money  he"
"demanded. And after accepting the money, it was stated by the appellant that"
"“ඩ ොක්කට ඩෙනිහින් දුන්නහැකි අද”."
"When she was subjected to cross-examination, it appears that the stand taken"
"up by the appellant had been that she voluntarily offered to donate some money"
"to the school as she was also an old girl. He has denied obtaining any money"
"from  PW-01.  The  defence  has  marked  two  contradictions  in  her  evidence,"
"namely, V-01 which refers to whether the principal asked her to sit down when"
"she  visited  the  school  office,  and  V-02,  which  refers  to  whether  the  principal"
"asked for the appeal number or not."
"The decoy employed by the investigating officer namely Lalaja Herath has given"
"evidence and corroborated the evidence of PW-01."
"In  this  matter,  the  two  persons  mentioned  by  the  PW-01  as  the  persons  who"
"introduced her to the appellant, namely Madanayake (PW-07) and Asanka (PW-"
"08)  also  has  given  evidence  on  behalf  of  the  prosecution.  Although  they  have"
"admitted that the appellant was introduced to PW-01 by them and the appellant"
"agreed  to  help  in  the  process  of  admitting  the  child  to  the  school,  they  have"
"denied that they are aware of the solicitation of a bribe. They have stated that"
