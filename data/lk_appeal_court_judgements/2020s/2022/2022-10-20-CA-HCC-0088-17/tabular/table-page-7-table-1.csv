"determine  whether  the  prosecution  has  proved  the  case  against  the  appellant"
"beyond reasonable doubt."
"It  was  his  position  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to  follow  the"
"essential requirements of a judgement as envisaged in section 283 of the Code"
"of Criminal Procedure Act and thereby failed to afford a fair trial to the appellant,"
"and it was dangerous to allow such a judgement to stand."
"The  position  of  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG)  in  this  regard  was"
"that it was unfair to argue that there was no proper evaluation of the evidence."
"It  was  his  position  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  the"
"evidence of PW-01 who was the injured and that of the doctor who examined him"
"and the investigating officer in its correct perspective. It was his position that"
"even  the  position  of  the  appellant  had  been  that  there  was  a  previous  enmity"
"between the parties, and PW-01 has given cogent and trustworthy evidence as"
"to the incident and that he has clearly identified the appellant as the person who"
"shot at him. It was his position that if one takes care to read the judgment as a"
"whole, it becomes clear that the learned High Court Judge has come to a correct"
"finding  as  to  the  guilt  of  the  appellant, which  needs  no  disturbance  from  this"
"Court."
"He was also of the view that given the facts and the circumstances, the sentence"
"imposed by the learned High Court Judge was very much fair and adequate."
