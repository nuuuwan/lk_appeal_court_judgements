"It was the submission of the learned President’s Counsel that although it was"
"the  evidence  of  PW-01  that  two  shots  were  fired  at  him,  the  medical  report"
"marked P-01 speaks about only one injury. It was his position that the police"
"investigator did not find any evidence of an altercation or the foot bicycle the PW-"
"01 was allegedly riding at the time, and even no empty shells were found at the"
"scene  of  crime,  which  points  to  the  possibility  that  this  incident  was  not"
"something that happened as stated by the PW-01."
"It  was  his  contention  that  PW-01  has  not  given  clear  evidence  as  to  how  he"
"identified the appellant and had only stated that there was street light and he"
"did  not  see  the  appellant  initially.  The  learned  President’s  Counsel  points  out"
"that the evidence of the investigating officer was not satisfactory as to the light"
"condition for him to observe things at the scene of the crime, where he has given"
"contradictory evidence before the High Court and at the non-summary inquiry."
"It was his stand that since the OIC of the Negombo police station has reached"
"the scene of the crime few hours after the incident, if there was an incident as"
"alleged, he could have observed relevant evidence in this regard whereas he has"
"not, which should have been considered in favour of the appellant."
"Commenting on the judgement of the learned High Court Judge, it was the stand"
"of the learned President’s Counsel that it was a total misdirection for the learned"
"trial Judge to conclude that the PW-01 was able to identify the accused from the"
"light available in the nearby houses which was not a matter in evidence. He also"
"contends  that  the  contradiction  marked  V-01  had  been  considered  by  the"
"learned High Court Judge on a completely wrong basis. Another contention of"
"the learned President’s Counsel was that the learned High Court Judge has failed"
"to consider the dock statement of the appellant, in its correct perspective, which"
"in his view was a misdirection by the learned High Court Judge. He also points"
"out that the learned High Court Judge’s determination that the PW-01’s evidence"
"had been corroborated by the evidence of the doctor was also a misdirection in"
"law.  It  was  his  contention  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to"
"examine the nexus between the appellant and the injured and has failed to"
