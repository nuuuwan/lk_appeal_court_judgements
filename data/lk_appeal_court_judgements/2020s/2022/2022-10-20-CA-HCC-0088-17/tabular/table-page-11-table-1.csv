"which  has  not  prejudiced  the  substantial  rights  of  the  parties  or"
"occasioned a failure of justice.”"
"The  PW-03,  the  main  investigation  officer,  has  stated  in  his  evidence  that  he"
"inspected  the  scene  of  the  crime  in  the  night  itself  using  the  torch  he  was"
"carrying and the available street light. In his affidavit evidence tendered to the"
"Magistrate Court for the purposes of the non-summary inquiry, he has failed to"
"mention  that  there  was  a  street  light,  as  pointed  by  the  learned  President’s"
"Counsel  in  his  submissions  to  this  Court.  I  find  that  when  the  witness  was"
"confronted at the trial in this regard, he has admitted that it was an omission,"
"but has stated that it was an oversight in the affidavit evidence, but in fact he"
"has made notes in that regard."
"I  am  unable  to  agree  that  it  was  a  material  omission  on  the  part  of  the"
"investigating  officer  that  has  the  effect  of  vitiating  the  evidence  of  PW-01  that"
"there  was  a  street  light  at  the  scene  of  the  crime.  Similarly,  the  failure  of  the"
"police who came to the scene of the crime few hours after the incident to find"
"any spent bullets and the foot bicycle of the injured, is not a matter that can be"
"held against the evidence of the PW-01, or a reason to believe such an incident"
"did not take place."
"I do not find merit in the contention that the learned High Court Judge has failed"
"to follow the essential requirements of a judgment as provided for by section 283"
"of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act."
"In the judgment, the learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence with"
"a clear understanding that looking for proof whether the PW-01 has identified"
"the person who shot at him was paramount in this action. After deciding on the"
"identity of the appellant, the learned trial judge has considered the evidence as"
"a whole to come to the finding that the appellant was guilty as charged, while"
"acquitting the other accused for reasons recorded."
