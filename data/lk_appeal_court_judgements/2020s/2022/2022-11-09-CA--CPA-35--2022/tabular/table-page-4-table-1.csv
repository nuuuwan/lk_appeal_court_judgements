"Be that as it may, in a matter filed under the provisions of the above mentioned"
"act  an  accused  charged  under  the  said  act  can  be  enlarged  on  bail  only  upon"
"exceptional circumstances."
"The term exceptional has not been defined in the act, but in many of our cases"
"decided cases it has been held that exceptionality differs from case to case."
"In the instant matter the exceptionality urged is the long period of remand even"
"after the receipt of the Government Analyst report."
"In the case of Attorney General vs. Ediriweera (2006 1 SLR Pg 25) it was held,"
"“………………… Delay is always a relative term and the question to be considered"
"is not whether there was mere explicable delay, as when there is a backlog of"
"cases,  but  whether  there  has  been  excessive  or  oppressive  delay  and  this"
"always depend on the facts and circumstances of the case…………..”"
"In  the  instant  matter  the  accused  has  been  in  remand  since  2016  up  to  date"
"which  is  now  7  years  and  still  the  trial  has  not  commenced  and  the  State"
"Counsel  had  objected  verbally  but  has  failed  to  comply  with  rule  52  of  the"
"Supreme Court rules, which in the event of any violation it is the discretion of"
"Court  to  consider  the  submissions  of  the  respondents  as  per  the  case  of"
"“Christopher v. Don Paul, [1990] 2SLR L R 54 (CA)."
"Hence for the reasons stated above this Court sets aside the impugned order of"
"the High Court and direct the learned High Court Judge to enlarges the accused"
"namely  AnvarJeyalaabdeenImithiyas  on  suitable  conditions  of  bail  upon  the"
"receipt of this Order."
