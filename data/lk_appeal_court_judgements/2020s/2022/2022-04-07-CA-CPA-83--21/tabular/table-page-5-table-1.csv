"personal 
liberty  of  a  person,  pending 
investigation  on  trial,  shall  not"
"constitute punishment”"
"Therefore,  it  has  been  enshrined  in  the  Constitution  itself  that  a  person"
"under  arrest  should  not  be  detained 
in  custody  depriving  his  personal"
"liberty, pending investigation or trial without a justifiable reason."
"The  same  has  been  very  lengthily  discussed  by  the  former  Chief  Justice"
"Sarath Silva in the judgment of Sumanadasa v Attorney General (Sri Lanka"
"law reports 2006 pg 202) where he has stated that “…fundamental rights"
"of petitioners guaranteed by the Article 13(2) has been infringed …being"
"detained 
in 
custody  merely  upon  being  produced 
in 
courts 
and"
"incarcerated without a remedy until the conclusion of their trials."
"Hence  in  the  instant  matter,  although  the  case  against  the  accused  has"
"been  postponed  due 
to  matters  beyond 
the 
control  of  Court  and"
"prosecution , the delay in adjudicating the charge against him makes it an"
"exceptional circumstance to allow the instant matter in view of the afore"
"mentioned decided cases."
"As  such,  the 
instant  application  for  revision 
is  allowed  and  this  Court"
"directs  the 
learned  High  Court 
judge  to  enlarge  the  accused  namely"
"Samaraweera Arachchige Hashan Rodrego on suitable conditions of bail."
