"In  Hattuwan  Pedige  Sugath  Karunaratne  v.  The  Attorney  General  SC"
"Appeal 32 of 2020 Aluwihare PC J., held that:"
"“No doubt the duty of a State Counsel is to present the Prosecution in an"
"effective manner to the best of their ability in furtherance of securing a"
"conviction,  if  the  evidence  can  support  the  charge.  The  Prosecutor,"
"however, is an officer of the court and their role is to assist the court to"
"dispense justice. Thus, it is not for a Prosecutor to ensure a conviction at"
"any cost, but to see that the truth is elicited, and justice is meted out. A"
"Prosecutor is not expected to keep out relevant facts either from the court"
"or from the accused. It the investigation has revealed matters which are"
"favourable to the Accused and the accused is unaware of the existence"
"of  such  facts,  it  is  the  bounden  duty  of  the  Prosecutor  to  make  those"
"facts available to the court and to the defence”."
