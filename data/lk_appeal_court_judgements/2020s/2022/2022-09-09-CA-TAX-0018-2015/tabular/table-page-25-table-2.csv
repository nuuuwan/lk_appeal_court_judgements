"(supra)  held  that  the  BOI  must  determine  the  project 
implementation"
"period and the date of the commencement of the tax exemption period. It"
"thus, held:"
"“[47] Under such circumstances, I hold that it is the BOI that must determine"
"the project implementation  period  and the date of the commencement of"
"the tax exemption period, which must be specified in a certificate issued by"
"the  BOI  having  regard  to  the  two  rules  set  out  in  Clause  12  (i)  of  the"
"Agreement. I further hold that it is the BOI that must determine whether or"
"not  the  Appellant  had  met  the 
investment  criteria  before  determining"
"whether or not the Appellant is entitled to the tax concessions referred to in"
"Sub-Clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Clause 12 (i) of the Agreement."
"[
48] It is obvious that the BOI could not have determined that the Appellant"
"had met the investment criterion and issued a certificate determining the tax"
"exemption period before the lapse of (i) the period of 24 months from the"
"date 
of 
the 
Agreement 
(Clause 
6) 
and 
(ii) 
the 
extended 
project"
"implementation period granted by the BOI (31.03.2009)."
"[
49]  The  period  of  24  months  set  out  in  the  Agreement  for  the  project"
"implementation was extended by the BOI and when the Appellant satisfied"
"the  minimum  investment  committed  to  the  project  during  the  extended"
"project implementation period, the BOI decided by letter dated 07.06.2011"
"that the Appellant had met the investment criterion (p. 17). The BOI by the"
"same letter determined that the Appellant was entitled to the first year of tax"
"holiday, covering the period from 01.04.2009 to 31.03.2010 (2009/2010) and"
"not prior to that year of assessment (2009/2010)”."
