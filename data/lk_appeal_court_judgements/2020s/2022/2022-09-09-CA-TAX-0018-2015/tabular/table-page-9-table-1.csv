"investing the required amount of Rs. 1,500 million prior to the expiration of"
"the 36 month period, the said supplementary agreement was of no force or"
"effect in law and was subsequently terminated by the BOI by its letter dated"
"18.11.2009, which was further confirmed by the Chairman of the BOI by his"
"letter dated 02.06.2010."
