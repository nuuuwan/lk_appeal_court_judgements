"commitment of Rs. 1,500 million within a period of 36 months and in terms"
"of clause 2(ii) of the Gazette No. 1019 /13, the tax exemption period shall"
"be  reckoned 
from 
the  date  on  which 
the  enterprise  makes 
its 
first"
"commercial  production  after  an  additional  investment  of  any  sum  of"
"such value as is specified in column I to meet the additional cost of the"
"project for the period specified in column II. In my view, the determination"
"made  by  the  BOI  as  specified 
in  the  certificate 
issued  by  the  BOI  on"
"24.12.2002 is consistent with clause 2 (ii) of the Gazette No. 1019/13, and"
"the principal BOI agreement No. 88 dated 04.06.1998."
"[52]  Accordingly,  I  am  not  inclined  to  agree  with  the  submission  of  the"
"Appellant that the first commercial production date ought to be regarded"
"as  01.04.1999  when  the  additional  investment  of  Rs.  1,500  million  was"
"made  within  a  period  of  36  months  from  the  date  of  the  principal  BOI"
"agreement as required by clause 10(vi) of the principal agreement."
"[53] The Appellant seeks to challenge the tax certificate issued by the BOI"
"in terms of clause 10(vi) of the BOI Act on the ground, inter alia, that it has"
"been issued contrary to the already decided tax exemption period set out"
"in the supplementary agreement. It is to be noted that the tax certificate"
"dated 24.12.2002 issued by the BOI is the one and only certificate issued"
"by the BOI in terms of clause 10(vi) of the BOI agreement No. 88 as correctly"
"submitted by Mr. Kanag-Isvaran."
"[54] This raises the question whether or not the tax certificate issued by the"
"BOI in terms of clause 10(vi) of the principal agreement can be challenged"
"by the Appellant in this proceeding. Mr. Kanag-Isvaran heavily relied on the"
"decisions of the Court of Appeal in Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue"
"v.  Seylan  Development  PLC 
(C.A. 
(TAX)  Appeal  No.  10/2004  decided  on"
"06.04.2017 and Setmil Developers Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland"
"Revenue  C.A./TaxNo.  27/2019  decided  on  22.03.2022 
in  support  of  his"
"contention 
that 
it 
is 
the  BOI 
that  must  determine 
the  date  of 
the"
"commencement of the tax exemption period, and specify it in the certificate"
"issued by the BOI, as it has happened in the present case. He submitted"
"that  therefore, the certificate issued by the BOI cannot be challenged by"
"the Appellant in this proceeding unless the Appellant challenged the said"
"certificate by way of writ proceeding."
