"(iii.) 
Has the Court of Trial drawn the wrong inference from the matters in evidence?"
"Lord Pearce in Onnassi vs. Vergottis ((1968)2 Lloyds' R.403) stated that;"
"'one thing is clear, not so much as a rule of law but rather as a working rule of common"
"sense.  A  Trial  Judge  has,  except  on  rare  occasions,  a  very  great  advantage  over  an"
"appellate court; evidence of a witness heard and seen has a very great advantage over a"
"transcript  of  that  evidence;  and  a  Court  of  Appeal  should  never  interfere  unless  it  is"
"satisfied  both  that  the  judgment  ought  not  to  stand  and  that  the  divergence  of  view"
"between  the  Trial  Judge  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  not  been  occasioned  by  any"
"demeanour of the witnesses or truer atmosphere of the trial (which may have eluded the"
"appellate court) or by any other of those advantages which the trial judge possesses'."
"Appellate Courts are generally slow to interfere with the decisions of inferior courts on questions"
"of fact or oral testimony. The Privy Council had stated that appellate court should not ordinarily"
"interfere with the trial courts opinion as to the credibility of a witness as the Trial Judge alone"
"knows  the  demeanour  of  the  witness;  he  alone  can  appreciate  the  manner 
in  which  the"
"questions are answered, whether with honest candour or with doubtful plausibility and whether"
"after careful thought or with reckless glibness; and he alone can form a reliable opinion as to"
"whether  the  witness  has  emerged  with  credit  from  cross-examination  (Vide,  Valarshak  Seth"
"Apcar vs. Standard Coal Company Limited AIR (1943)PC 159)."
"It was decided in Sris Chandra Nandi vs. Rakhalananda (AIR) 1941 PC 16 where the matter is one"
"of inference from evidence, and the evidence is not well balanced the appellate court will set"
"aside the finding of the trial court if it is against the weight of evidence."
"In D, W. Wanigasekera vs The Republic of Sri Lanka 1979 (1) NLR 241 at 250 & 25Z  it was held"
"that;"
"'I am therefore of the view that the 'basic fact' required to be proved in a prosecution"
"under section 23A of the Bribery Act is that the accused acquired property which cannot"
"or could not have been acquired with any part of his sources of income or receipts known"
"to the prosecution after investigation; the prosecution is not required to prove that the"
"acquisitions  were  made  with 
income  or  receipts 
from  bribery.' 
If  the  tribunal 
is"
"reasonably  satisfied,  that  is,  satisfied  to  the  extent  that  it  can  say  ""we  think  it  more"
"probable than not that the accused acquired the property by proceeds other than income"
"or receipts from bribery' then the accused is entitled to an acquittal.'"
"It was held in Attorney General vs. R.M. Karunaratne SC 16/74 D.C. Colombo B/75-SC minutes of"
"17.06.1977 that;"
"'What a person (accused) has to prove is that a property was not acquired by bribery or"
"was  not  property  to  which  he  had  converted  any  property  acquired  by  bribery.  The"
"ordinary and usual method by which a person may prove this is by showing the source"
