"incident. The Learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence of the"
"said witnesses and applying the necessary tests, had very accurately arrived"
"at the conclusion that the evidence of defence witnesses had failed to create"
"a doubt in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses."
"Under  this  same  ground  the  counsel  for  the  Appellant  contends  that  the"
"police party had failed to record the evidence of the defence witness No.02"
"Premalatha who is the sister of the Appellant. Premalatha’s contention was"
"that the Appellant was arrested at his own residence and not on the untarred"
"road  as  claimed  by  the  prosecution.  The  Appellant  further  argues  that"
"although  in  his  evidence  PW08  RPC  Lal  Kumara  had  said  that  he  had"
"recorded a statement from a woman aged 35 years old on that day, but in"
"the  evidence  given  by  him  in  the  1st  trial  he  had  testified  that  the  said"
"statement was recorded by PC 30204 Bandara. Hence, he argues that this a"
"very serious contradiction."
"This contention cannot be considered as a serious contradiction as PW08 did"
"not deny that the police recorded a statement from defence witness No.02."
"His  position  was  that  her  statement  had  been  recorded  at  the  Appellant’s"
"house. He was unable to state as to who recorded her statement as he too"
"had given evidence after nearly 10 years of the incident.  Due to this reason"
"this contention cannot be a serious one in this case. Hence this ground too"
"has no merit."
"In the fifth ground the Appellant contends that PW01 and PW08 had given"
"contradictory evidence with regard to the colour of bag in which the Heroin"
"was detected."
"In the evidence of PW01 at pages 226-227 of the brief it is stated that a black"
"coloured ‘tulip’ bag was recovered from the Appellant’s trouser pocket. Upon"
"further examination of the said bag a  pink  coloured  bag with  some brown"
"coloured substance inside was recovered. As per page 245 of the brief, the"
"said pink coloured bag was marked as P5 through this witness."
