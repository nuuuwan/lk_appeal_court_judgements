"Originally the Appellant was found guilty to the charge and the learned High"
"Court Judge sentenced him to life imprisonment on 17/12/2009. During the"
"first  trial  when  the  defence  was  called  the  Appellant  while  giving  evidence"
"from the witness box took up the defence of alibi but this was disallowed by"
"the  learned  High  Court  Judge  on  the  basis  that  the  Appellant  had  not"
"followed  the  proper  procedure  laid  down  in  Section  126A  of  the  Code  of"
"Criminal  Procedure  Act.  Hence  the  Appellant  went  back  to  the  dock  and"
"made a dock statement."
"In the Appeal No.CA/293/2009, filed against the 1st conviction, the Court of"
"Appeal after considering  the submissions made on behalf of the Appellant"
"held that the rejection of leading evidence for the defence of alibi in the trial"
"was inaccurate. Further His Lordships of the Court of Appeal had sent the"
"case back to the High Court for a re-trial before a new judge."
"This appeal is filed against the conviction and the sentence passed in the re-"
"trial. The re-trial was commenced on 24/02/2014 after more than 09 years"
"of the offence."
