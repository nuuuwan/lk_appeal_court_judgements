"Yet quite conveniently the Respondents using the decision of this Court to their"
"advantage try to resile from an assurance represented by them solely on the basis that"
"the Secretary had no authority. This is disingenuous conduct. The fact that the Secretary"
"had no authority, because of the unlawful election, to issue the letter P8 was contended"
"by the Respondents for the first time before this Court. This has not been informed before"
"to NEMRC or the National Selection Committee."
