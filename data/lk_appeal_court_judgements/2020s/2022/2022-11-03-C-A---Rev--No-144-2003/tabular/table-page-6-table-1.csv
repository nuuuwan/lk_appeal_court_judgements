"After an amendment to the Judgment under Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code, an order was"
"made  to  issue  a  commission  calling  for  the  final  plan.  After  the  interlocutory  decree,  the  first"
"claimant preferred his appeal to this Court."
"In this Court, parties were heard, and Judgment was entered to dismiss the application of the 1st"
"Respondent-Petitioner on 28.02.2011, emphasizing the judgment Perera and Others Vs. Adlin and"
"Others1."
"Aggrieved by that Judgment, the first claimant Petitioner moved to the Supreme court. Before a"
"final determination case was referred back for an order of substitution on behalf of the deceased"
"7th Defendant-Respondent, in this Court, that step was not taken, but the parties agreed to re-argue"
"the matter and to obtain a judgment regarding the main matter."
"The first claimant, the Petitioner, took the stand that Plaintiff had failed in his duty to issue notice"
"to all claimants. Referring to 20(1) of the Partition Act No.21 of 1977, the Petitioner had argued"
"that the partition judgment could not stand violating a mandatory provision."
"The  second  argument  was  that  no  party  to  the  action  claimed  the  crops.  Only  the  1st  Plaintiff"
"claimed the building marked as ""A"" in the Preliminary Plan where he was residing. In evidence,"
"the 2nd Plaintiff had admitted that the first claimant had made his claim regarding certain buildings."
"In  his  evidence,  he  had  pleaded  to  keep  those  buildings  unallotted.  The  first  claimant,  the"
"Petitioner, argued that Plaintiff had violated yet another provision which demands the Plaintiff to"
"bring to the notice of the Court all persons having rights, shares or interests regarding the land to"
"be partitioned, which is more fully clarified in Section 5 of the Partition Act. The Court also should"
"have returned the plaint to Plaintiff to comply with those sections."
