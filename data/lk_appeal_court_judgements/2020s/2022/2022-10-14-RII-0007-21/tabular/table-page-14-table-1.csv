"“Section 66 (1) (a) of the Act empowers a police officer to file information under the Act. In"
"such a situation the police officer has to decide whether the breach of the peace is likely or"
"threatened. Under subsection (b) of section 66(1), a private party can file information and it is the"
"Court that has to decide whether the breach of the peace is threatened or likely due to the dispute.”"
"[emphasis added]"
"His Lordship Padman Surasena J. (along with her Ladyship K.K. Wickremasinghe"
"J.) in The Municipal Council Batticaloa v. M.K. Ratnasingam CA PHC 287/2005 decided"
"on 08.02.2018 (Reported in 2018 ACJ Vol 1 p. 65) held:"
"“It is now settled law that a party invoking the jurisdiction vested in Primary Court under"
"section 66 (l)(b) of the Act, shall first satisfy the Primary Court that a breach of peace is threatened"
"or likely owing to the dispute he complains about.” [emphasis added]"
"However, recently, his Lordship Mahinda Samayawardhena J. held his Lordship"
"Ismail  J’s  dictum  in  Velupillai  (supra),  that  when  information  is  filed  under  Section"
"66(1)(b) the Magistrate must act cautiously, does not represent the correct position of law."
"In  Gamaralalage  Jayasinghe  v.  Mahara  Mudiyanselage  Loku  Bandara  Case  No."
"CA/PHC/76/2018 decided on 20.12.2019, his Lordship held:"
"“…..under section 66(2), it has been enacted that when the first information is filed under"
"section 66(1), irrespective of whether it is filed by the police or a party to the dispute, the"
"Magistrate is automatically vested with jurisdiction to inquire into and determine the matter,"
"w
i
thout further ado. Under section 66(1), the formation of opinion as to whether a breach of the"
"peace is threatened or likely is left to the police officer inquiring into the dispute or to any party to"
"the dispute. Both are on equal footing. Who files the information is beside the point.” [emphasis"
"added]"
"Therefore,  as  per  these  authorities  the  determination  of  whether  there  exists  a"
"dispute  affecting  land,  and  consequently whether  that  dispute  threatens  or  is likely  to"
"cause a breach of the peace will be made by the police officer filing the information. Upon"
"receiving the information, the Magistrate must presume that both those conditions have"
"been satisfied and proceed to issue notices. On the contrary, when an information is filed"
"by a disputing party it appears there is a variance of views, in that their Lordships Ismail"
"J., Dehideniya J., and Surasena J. differ from the judgments of their Lordships Wijetunga"
"J.  and  Samayawardhena  J.  The  Magistrate  is  advised  to  tread  lightly  by  exercising"
"caution. A fear that, as explained below, is justified."
"Nevertheless, with all due respect to the aforementioned line of authorities, we are"
"unable  to  agree  that  the  Magistrate  is  compelled  to  act  on  the  filing  of  information."
