"It is then important that Section 66, which is reproduced as follows, is read in this"
"light."
"(1) Whenever owing to a dispute affecting land a breach of the peace is threatened or likely-"
"(a) the police officer inquiring into the dispute-"
"(i)  shall  with  the  least  possible  delay  file  an  information  regarding  the  dispute  in  the  Primary"
"Court within whose jurisdiction the land is situate and require each of the parties to the dispute"
"to  enter  into  a  bond  for  his  appearance  before  the  Primary  Court  on  the  day  immediately"
"succeeding the date of filing the information on which sittings of such court are held;"
"or (ii) shall, if necessary in the interests of preserving the peace, arrest the parties to the dispute"
"and produce them forthwith before the Primary Court within whose jurisdiction the land is situate"
"to be dealt with according to law and shall also at the same time file in that court the information"
"regarding the dispute;"
"or"
"(b) any party to such dispute may file an information by affidavit in such Primary Court setting"
"out the facts and the relief sought and specifying as respondents the names and addresses of the"
"other  parties  to  the  dispute  and  then  such  court  shall  by  its usual process  or  by registered  post"
"notice the parties named to appear in court on the day specified in the notice―such day being not"
"later than two weeks from the day on which the information was filed."
"(2) Where an information is filed in a Primary Court under subsection (1), the Primary Court shall"
"have and is hereby vested with jurisdiction to inquire into, and make a determination or order on,"
"in  the  manner  provided  for  in  this  Part,  the  dispute  regarding  which  the  information  is  filed."
"[emphasis added]"
"It is trite law that the Magistrate does not undertake an investigation into title or"
"right to possession. That is the function of a civil court. As mentioned above, Section 66"
"was preceded by Section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law No. 44 of 1973, which"
"corresponds to Section 145 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure. These Sections are"
"reproduced for the purpose of convenience:"
"Section 62 Administration of Justice Law:"
"Whenever a Magistrate on information furnished by a police officer or otherwise has reason"
"to believe that the existence of a dispute affecting land situated within his jurisdiction is likely to"
"cause a breach of the peace, he may issue notice…."
