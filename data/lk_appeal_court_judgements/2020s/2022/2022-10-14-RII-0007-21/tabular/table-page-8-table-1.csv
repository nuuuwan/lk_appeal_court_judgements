"Lordship Salam J. in the case of Jayantha Gunasekara v. Jayatissa Gunasekara [2011] 1"
"SLR 284. His Lordship observed:"
"â€œTo recapitulate the salient points that are in favour of expeditious execution of orders under"
"part VII, the following points are worth being highlighted."
"1
.
 It is quite clear, that the intention of the legislature in enacting Part VII of the PCPA is to"
"preserve the peace in the society. If an unusual length of time (sometimes more than a decade) is"
"taken to execute a temporary order for the prevention of peace, the purpose of the legislation would"
"definitely be defeated and the intention of the Legislature in introducing the most deserving action"
"o
f
 
the era in the nature of sui generis would be rendered utterly ridiculous."
"2
.
 In as much as there should be expeditious disposal of a case stemming from the breach of"
"the peace there should correspondingly be more expeditious and much efficient methods to give"
