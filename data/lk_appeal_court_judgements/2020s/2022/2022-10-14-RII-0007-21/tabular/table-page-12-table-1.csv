"likely. It is important for this initial ‘inquiry’ to take place before the Magistrate orders"
"the issuance of notice and any interim order."
"In the first and third methods of filing information, this Court is of the view that"
"the  Magistrate  must  ascertain  the  existence  of  both  conditions.  In  the  second  method,"
"when disputing parties are arrested and produced before Court, the breach of the peace"
"is immediately evident that there would not be a need to ascertain if there is a breach of"
"the peace. However, the requirement to conduct an initial ‘inquiry’ is not dispensed with"
"because the Magistrate ought to inquire whether the breach of the peace is threatened or"
"likely because of a dispute affecting land. It is essential in an application under Section"
"66 that the dispute affects land as the offence of breach of the peace can arise in other"
"contexts as well such as Section 81 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which has nothing"
"to do with land."
"This requirement to conduct an initial ‘inquiry’ or ‘screening’ of this sort may be"
"regarded as contradictory to other judgments of this Court and seen as an application of"
"the old law. The predecessor section, that is Section 62 of the Administration of Justice"
"Law, reproduced again for convenience, provided that:"
"Whenever a Magistrate on information furnished by a police officer or otherwise has reason"
"to believe that the existence of a dispute affecting land situated within his jurisdiction is likely to"
"cause a breach of the peace, he may issue notice……"
"Similar to the corresponding Section found in the Indian Criminal Procedure Code,"
"the old law required the Magistrate to satisfy himself by determining whether the dispute"
"affected land and owing to such dispute a breach of the peace was threatened or likely."
"This is reflected in the dicta of His Lordship Soza J. in Navaratnasingham v. Arumugam"
