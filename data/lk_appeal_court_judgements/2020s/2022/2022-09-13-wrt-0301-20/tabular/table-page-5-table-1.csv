"Mandamus compelling the Respondents to grant a permit to the Petitioner."
"Succession under the Land Development Ordinance is different from the general"
"law on succession. This is made clear by Section 170 of the Land Development Ordinance"
"which  provides  that  no  written  law,  other  than  this  Ordinance,  which  provides  for"
"succession to land upon an intestacy shall apply to any land alienated under the Land"

"On the death of the original grant holder, the spouse of the grant holder is entitled"
"to succeed to the land. If the spouse of the original grant holder dies or fails to succeed to"
"the land, it is only then that a nominated successor can succeed to the land. This position"
"was  clearly  established  by  his  Lordship  Malalgoda  J.  in  Kalander  Asiya  Umma  v."
"Mohideen Bawa Abdul Cassim, SC Appeal 48/2013 decided on 04.09.2019. Having set out"

"failure to succeed) of the spouse of the original permit holder.”"
"In the instant case, assuming that the 4th Respondent has failed to take possession"
"of the land within a period of six months from the date of the grant-holder’s death (as per"
"Section 68) it is only then that the nominated successor can succeed to the land."
