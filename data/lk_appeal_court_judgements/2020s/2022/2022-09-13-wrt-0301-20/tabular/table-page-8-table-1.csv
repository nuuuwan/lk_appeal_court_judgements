"The above principles governing the issue of a writ of Mandamus were also discussed at"
"length in P.K. Benarji v H.J. Simonds.  Whether the facts show the existence of any or all"
"pre-requisites to the granting of the writ is a question of law in each case to be decided not in"
"any  rigid  or  technical  view  of  the  question,  but  according  to  a  sound  and  reasonable"
"interpretation. The court will not grant a Mandamus to enforce a right not of a legal but of a"
"purely equitable nature however extreme the inconvenience to which the applicant might be"

"requirements: first, the duty must be of a public as opposed to a private character, and second,"
"even if the duty is of a public character it must be owed to an individual."
"In the instant case, as the Petitioner has no legal right to compel the Respondents to hold"
"a fresh inquiry and grant a permit to her the Writ of Mandamus will not lie."
"Similarly,  the  Petitioner  will  not  be  able  to  obtain  a  Writ  of  Certiorari  to  quash  the"
