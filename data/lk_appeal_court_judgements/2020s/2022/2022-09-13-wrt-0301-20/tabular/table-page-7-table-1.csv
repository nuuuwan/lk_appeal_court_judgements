"In the instant case, the Petitioner does not fall within any of the categories of relatives"
"provided  in  Rule  1  of  Schedule  Three  as  she  is  the  daughter-in-law  of  the  original  grant-"
"holder. She would thus have no legal right in terms of the Ordinance to claim  a permit for"
"the  said land.  For  the Petitioner  to  claim,  her late  husband after  the  demise  of  his  father"

"exercise his rights."
"In order to claim a Writ of Mandamus, which is, to use the words of Wade & Forsyth,"
"“a weapon in the hands of the ordinary citizen, when a public authority fails to do its duty by"
"him”, there are certain pre-requisites that the party applying for it ought to satisfy.  In the"
"case of Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs Jafferjee and Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd"
"[2005] 1 SLR 89 his Lordship J.A.N. De Silva, J. (as he then was), with their Lordships S.N."
"Silva C.J. and Weerasuriya J. agreeing, set out these prerequisites as follows:"
"“There is rich and profuse case law on Mandamus on the conditions to be satisfied by the"
"Applicant. Some of the conditions precedent the issue of Mandamus appear to be:"
"(a)  The Applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the parties"
"against whom the Mandamus is sought (R v Barnstaple Justices). The foundation of"
"Mandamus is the existence of a legal right (Napier Ex Parte)"
"(b)  The right to be enforced must be a “Public Right” and the duty sought to be enforced"
