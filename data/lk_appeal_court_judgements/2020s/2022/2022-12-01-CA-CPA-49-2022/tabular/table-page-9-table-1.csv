"will require a judicious evaluation of the case presented during the support"
"stage in terms of assessing whether it established a prima facie case. Such"
"an assessment has not been carried out by the learned High Court judge."
"Hence it is the considered view of this Court that the impugned order has"
"erroneously  dismissed  the  application  of  the  petitioner  by 
failing  to"
"examine  whether  the  purported  exceptionalities  establish  a  prima  facie"
"case."
"Moreover, the above position of this court is further buttressed by Rule 3"
"(4)  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  (Appellate  Procedure)  Rules,  1990  where  it  is"

"erroneous application of the law. Hence, it is the observation of this Court"
"that  there  exists  an 
irregularity  and  an 
illegality  of  the  order  dated"
"05.04.2022 delivered by the High Court of Tangalle."
