"three-wheeler got down, the informant said;"
"“අර බැස්රස් එයා  මයි කියා යන්න ගියා”."
"It is difficult to believe the fact that the informant waited until the appellant got"
"down  from  the  three-wheeler  and  that  he  described  the  clothes  the  appellant"
"was  wearing.  If  the  appellant  was  the  only  person  who  came  in  the  three-"

"Therefore,  this  additional  piece  of  evidence  regarding  the  appellant’s  attire  is"
"difficult to believe."
