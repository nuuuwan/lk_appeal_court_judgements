"The position of the defence was consistent throughout the trial.  The appellant"
"was  produced  before  the  Maligakanda  Magistrate  Court  on  12th  of  April  2012"
"and  remanded 
in  custody.  On  the  24th  of  April  2013,  an  Attorney-at-law"
"appeared for the appellant and stated to the Magistrate that the appellant was"
"arrested  at  his  residence  and  not  when he  was  travelling  in  his  three-wheeler"
"and  also  stated  that  the  report  of  the  PNB  was  false.    The  Magistrate  Courts"
"record is attached as a part of the proceedings."
"The  learned  Trial  Judge  has  not  paid  attention  to  the  fact  that  there  were"
"in 
the  evidence  of  PW1  and  contradictions 
glaring  contradictions  per  se"
"between the testimony of PW1 and PW4."
"The  Trial  Judge  had  not  mentioned  nor  had  he  considered  the 
facts  the"
"appellant  stated  to  the  Magistrates  Court.  The  learned  Trial  Judge  had  not"
"stated whether he accepts or rejects the dock statement of the appellant.  If the"
"dock  statement  was  rejected, 
the  reasons 
for  such  rejections  should  be"
"reflected  in  the  judgment.    The  dock  statement  of  the  appellant  is  not  a  mere"
"denial.  He explained his position. The defence position is not an afterthought."
"It has been the position adopted by the appellant from the date an Attorney-at-"
"law first represented him at the Magistrate’s court.  The position of the defence"
"was duly suggested to the prosecution witnesses. The learned Trial Judge has"
"not  evaluated  the  defence  evidence  at  all.    This  amounts  to  a  denial  of  a  fair"
"trial."
"The  contradictions  and  improbabilities  in  the  evidence  of  the  prosecution  and"
"the  evidence  of  the  appellant  create  a  reasonable  doubt  in  the  prosecution"
"case."
