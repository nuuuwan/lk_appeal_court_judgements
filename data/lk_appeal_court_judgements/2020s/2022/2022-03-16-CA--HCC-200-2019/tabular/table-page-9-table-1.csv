"For the foregoing reasons, I hold that both charges leveled against the"
"appellant  have  been  proved  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.  Accordingly,"
"the decision of the learned  High  Court Judge to convict the accused-"
"appellant  for  the  1st  and  2nd  counts  is  correct.  I  see  no  reason  to"
"interfere  with  the  sentence  passed  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge"
"because the sentence is lawful and correct in principle."
