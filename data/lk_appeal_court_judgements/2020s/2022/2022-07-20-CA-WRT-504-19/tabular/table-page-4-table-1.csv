"In this regard, the Court observes C. D Field's statement from ""Law Relating to"
"Estoppel""1 which reads as follows:"
"""Acquiescence or standing by when there is duty to speak or assert a right"
"creates an estoppel.""2"
"Attention of this Court was drawn towards a Supreme Court case which involves"
"the  4th  and  5th  Respondents;  however,  the  said  case  has  no  relevance  to  this"
"application  as this  Court  observes that  the  said case  was filed  only  to  prevent"
"promotion of certain other employees and not with regards to the application or"
"promotion of the 4th and 5th Respondents."
"The 4th and 5th Respondents in their evidence have stated that relief sought by"
"them  is  to  be  promoted  to  Grade  A6  and  is  seeking  relief  the  salary  and"
"allowances for Grade A6."
"I
n  the  above  pretext,  this  Court  also  observes  that  throughout  the  Arbitral"
"proceedings, the 4th and 5th Respondents have failed to establish that they were"
"duly qualified and that they are entitled to the promotions awarded. They have"
"not demonstrated that they were entitled to being promoted to grades A7, A6 and"
"A5 in addition to their admission that they were not qualified for promotion to"
"Grade A7. Further, it is also observed that the said Respondents do not fulfil or"
"hold the requisite experience in an executive role.  However, despite the lack of"
"required  qualifications,  availability  of  vacancies  and  prayer  by  the  4th  and  5th"
"Respondents, the 3rd Respondent has wrongfully granted promotions up to Grade"
"A7, beyond the relief sought by the said 4th and 5th Respondents and contrary to"
"the facts presented before him."
"I
 also observe that  the  3rd  Respondent  in  his  Arbitral  Award dated  24.06.2019"
"(marked as X10) has not analysed or provided any reasoning for arriving at his"
"1 (3rd Edition) at p.166"
"2 The aforesaid quote has been accepted with approval on the doctrine of estoppel in the"
"case of N K D LalithaPadmini & Others vs N. K. D. Pradeepa Kumari in SC/HC/CA/LANo."
