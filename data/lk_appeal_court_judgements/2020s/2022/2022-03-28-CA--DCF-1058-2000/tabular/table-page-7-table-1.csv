"As such, it clearly shows that the Debt Conciliation Board had dismissed the application of the 1st"
"Defendant-Appellant to review the Settlement Order marked as P5 and had not revised the original"
"settlemt P5 entered between parties. Therefore, it is apparent that the said settlement (P5) had been"
"revived only in relation to the amount to be paid."
"H
