rial before the High Court, her evidence given in the non-summary inquiry"
"was adopted. Although it was adopted, it was rejected by the Trial Judge as"
"it had not been led properly during the trial. Hence, PW1â€™s evidence has no"
"material value at all."
"P
W2,  the  second  daughter  of  PW3  also  came  out  upon  hearing  that  the"
"deceased had been stabbed. But she had not divulged anything the Appellant"
"had done when her mother went to the spot. She only confirmed that that"
"the 2nd Appellant had possessed a knife and the 1st Appellant had snatched"
"her gold chain. She also said when she came out people had already gathered"
"there."
"I
n  the  cross  examination  she  admitted  that  the  deceased  had  number  of"
"cases and was one time taken to the Criminal Investigation Department."
"A
lthough PW3 and PW2 rushed to the scene after hearing that the deceased"
"had been stabbed, both had contradicted their evidence on material points."
"According  to  PW3  when  she  went  to  the  spot  the  Appellants  were  present"
"and 1st Appellant  had assaulted  her while  2nd Appellant  had threated  and"
"prevented her reaching the deceased. But according to PW2 when she came"
"out  people  had  already  gathered  there  nothing  done  by  the  Appellants  as"
"described by PW3. She only added that her gold chain had been snatched by"
"the 1st Appellant. PW3 nowhere in her evidence mentioned about snatching"
"a gold chain from PW2.As the two witnesses simultaneously came out from"
"the house after hearing about the incident, but they deviated themselves on"
"material  points  which  certainly  endorses  the  1st  ground  of  appeal  of  the"
"Appellants."
