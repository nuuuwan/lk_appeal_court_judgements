"Even  though  PW08  had  mentioned  the  colour  of  P5  as  green  as  noted  on"
"page  313  of  the  brief,  the  defence  had  admitted  the  marking  P1-P8  under"
"Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. Hence, it"
"is a futile exercise to bring an argument regarding colour of P5 under this"
"ground."
"In the final ground of appeal the counsel for the Appellant contends that the"
"alteration  made  to  the  Government  Analyst  Report  is  highly  irregular  and"
"that it creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case."
"PW10  Mrs.  Rajapaksha,  the  Senior  Deputy  Government  Analyst  who  had"
"submitted the report which had been marked as Z-1 stated that she has done"
"a correction in open court when this case was heard first on 16/02/2009."
"According to her it was originally mentioned that Heroin (diacetylmorphine)"
"was not identified in the black coloured plastic bag in the last paragraph of"
"the  report.  As  she  wrongly  entered  the word  “not”  in  her  report,  with  the"
"permission of the court the word “not” was cut off and her counter sign was"
"placed at the end of the line. As she was the one who analysed the production"
"and submitted the report and corrected it in open court, she only placed her"
"counter signature in the report. (Emphasis added)"
"Upon  perusal  of  the  court  proceedings,  it  is  abundantly  clear  that  the"
"correction had been done to the Government Analyst Report in open court"
"with  the  approval  of  the  court.  Hence  it  is  incorrect  to  argue  that  this  an"
"irregular procedure. The court had given permission to alter the report after"
"examining her personal notes. The defence was awarded the opportunity to"
"cross examine her on her personal notes. As such relying on the Government"
"Analyst Report would not occasion a failure of justice. This ground of appeal"
"too is therefore, devoid of any merit."
"Further  the  defence  had  admitted  the  inward  journey  of  the  production"
"under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act."
