"PW01 in his evidence reiterated that he marked the production including the"
"white  paper  as  N-1.  According  to  him  he  had  marked  all  the  production"
"shown to him during the re-trial. At this point the prosecution brought to"
"the notice of the court that the said piece of paper was marked as P06 during"
"the 1st trial. As more than 09 years had elapsed following the incident the"
"said paper had been pasted with other production. Hence it is very difficult"
"to separate the same for identification. As this point also has no bearing on"
"the outcome of the case, the learned High Court Judge has not considered"
"this point in his judgment. Hence the Appellant is not successful in his first"
"ground of appeal."
"In his second ground the counsel for the Appellant contends that it raises a"
"serious  doubt  as  to  whether  PW01  IP  Ariyaruwan  introduced/planted  the"
"Heroin on the Appellant as PW01 was not checked before he left for the raid,"
"unlike the other officers."
"According  to  PW01  he  had  received  information  about  the  trafficking  of"
"Heroin through an informant of PW08 Lal Kumara. Accordingly, the raid was"
"organised. When this information was received by PW08 it was brought to"
"the notice of the Officer-in-Charge of the Narcotic Bureau by this witness."
"After receiving necessary instructions from the OIC, PW01 had organised the"
"raid. As he headed the raiding team, he had received all instructions from"
"the OIC of the Bureau. Hence PW01 was under direct supervision of the OIC"
"of the Bureau at all the times."
"As per the evidence of PW01 the Appellant is a stranger to him. No enmity"
"was  reported  against  the  Appellant.  PW01  had  only  seen  him  at  the  raid."
"There was no evidence of a necessity to plant/introduce Heroin against the"
"Appellant. As the argument advanced by the Appellant under this ground is"
"very vague this ground too has no merit."
"As the third and fourth appeal grounds are interconnected, the said grounds"
"of appeal have been considered conjointly. Under these grounds the counsel"
