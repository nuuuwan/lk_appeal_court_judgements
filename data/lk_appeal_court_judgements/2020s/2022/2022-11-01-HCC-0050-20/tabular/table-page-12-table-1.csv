"Explanation  2.-  A  previous  conviction  is  relevant  as  evidence  of  bad"
"character in such case."
"As a result, the fact that the person charged is of good character is always"
"relevant  in  criminal  proceedings.  However,  the  fact  that  he  has  a  bad"
"character is generally irrelevant. Hence, the prosecution should be mindful"
"not to lead character evidence of the accused, unless evidence has been given"
"that  he  has  a  good  character.  The  trial  judge  also  has  a  responsibility  to"
"ensure that bad character evidence of the accused does not creep into the"
"court proceedings."
