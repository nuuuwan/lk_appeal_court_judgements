"informant had assured that he would show off once the officers arrive at the"
"given  location.  Having  perused  the  information  of  PW2,  PW1  had  given"
"instructions  to  his  own  team  of  Unit-02  to  prepare  for  the  raid.  Having"
"selected  eight  officers  had  left  the  Bureau  at  about  10.35  hours  after"
"completing all formalities. Six of them had travelled in a double cab of the"
"Bureau and two had followed them in a motor bike."
"After arriving at the location, the informant was called to the location and he"
"had guided three officers to the house where the Appellant was expected to"
"be."
"According to PW1, the house was located at a by-road, namely 5th Lane and"
"the  distances  was  400  meters  from  the  place  where  they  had  met  the"
"informant. The informant had left the place after showing the 3rd house on"
"the lane to them. PW1, PW2 and PW4 had entered the premises of the house"
"through a partly opened small gate and remained there until an inmate to"
"open the door. After about nearly two hours, a person identified as Mahesh,"
"who is the brother-in-law of the Appellant had opened the door and he was"
"promptly  apprehended  by  the  trio  and  inquired  about  “Thilan”  as  per  the"
"information. As Mahesh had informed that the Appellant was in the upper"
"floor, PW1 and PW2 had rushed upstairs and entered into a partly opened"
"room. Upon entering the room, they had noticed a person who was seated in"
"front  of  a  dressing  table.  On  the  dressing  table  they  had  observed  three"
"cellophane  covered  parcels,  an  electronic  scale  and  six  more  cellophane"
"covers. As one of the parcels was opened, PW1 had examined the substance"
"contained in the parcel. From its colour and the odour, he had decided that"
"the said parcel contained Heroin. The Appellant was arrested and the items"
"on the table were taken in to their custody including a vehicle key."
"In the meantime, they had also observed a woman who was sleeping on a"
"bed  and  several  others  including  the  sister  of  the  Appellant  who  was  also"
"present in that house at that time. Their statements were recorded several"
"days after the arrest of the Appellant."
