"The  productions  alleged  to  have  been  recovered  from  the  Appellant  and"
"another  person  had  been  sent  together  in  one  parcel  to  the  Government"
"Analyst.  According  to  the  Government  Analyst’s  Report  the  total  weight  of"
"pure  Heroin  (diacetylmorphine)  detected  from  the  brown  coloured  powder"

"Former Commissioner General of Prisons, PW SI/Gayan attached to Airport"
"Terrorist Investigation Division Unit and PW CI/ Dharmakeerthi attached to"

"When  the  prosecution  had  closed  the  case  after  leading  the  prosecution"
"witnesses mentioned above, the defence was called and the Appellant had"
"given evidence from the witness box and called nine witnesses for his defence"
"and marked 18 documents. The Appellant had admitted the arrest by officers"
"of  the  Police  Narcotics  Bureau  on  20/06/2014,  but  categorically  denies"

"Considering  the  grounds  of  appeal  advanced  by  the  Appellant,  I  regard  it"
"appropriate to consider the fifth ground of appeal first."
"The Learned President’s Counsel under fifth ground of appeal, strenuously"
"argued  that  the  inadmissible  confessionary  items  of  evidence  had  been"
"allowed  to  creep  into  the  proceedings  thereby  prejudicing  the  mind  of  the"
"Trial Judge."
"In terms Section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance, confessions made to a police"
"officer  is  irrelevant  and  inadmissible.  Hence,  if  an  accused  has  made  a"
"confessionary statement in the course of the police investigations and where"
"such  statement  is  recorded  under  Section  110  of  the  Code  of  Criminal"
"Procedure  Act,  there  is  an  absolute  restriction  to  use  such  confession  as"
"evidence at the trial."
