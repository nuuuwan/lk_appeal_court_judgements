"therefore  the  defence  had  been  wrongly  and 
improperly  rejected."
"Thereby the conviction is bad in law."
"9.  The  Learned  Trial  Judge  has  misdirected  himself  in  examining  the"
"information book entries challenged by the defence while not providing"
"an opportunity to the defence to have access to the same. Thereby, the"
"Learned Trial Judge had deprived the Appellant of a fair trial."
"10. 
The Learned Trial Judge had been prejudiced prior to the final"
"determination as he appeared to have arrived at a decision even before"
"a  complete  evaluation  and  analysis  of  the  evidence.  Thereby,  the"
"Learned Trial Judge had denied the Appellant a fair trial guaranteed"
"by the Constitution."
