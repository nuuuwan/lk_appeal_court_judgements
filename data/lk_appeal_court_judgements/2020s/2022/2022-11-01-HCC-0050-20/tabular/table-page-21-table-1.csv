"In Paulis Appu v. Don Davit 32 NLR 335, the court held that:"
"“The use of Information Book for the purpose of arriving at  a decision"
"was irregular”."
"In  K.A.Shantha  Udayalal  v.  The  Attorney  General  SC.  Spl.  LA.  No."
"57/2017 decided on 30/01/2018 Sisira De Abrew, J. held that:"
"“In the present case, it is very clear that the Learned High Court Judge"
"has  used  the  police  statement,  non-summary  evidence  and  inquest"
"evidence which were not properly admitted in evidence. I therefore hold"
"that  the  decision  of  the  Learned  High  Court  judge  to  peruse  the  said"
"documents was wrong and contrary to law”."
"Hence,  it 
is  quite  clear  that  perusal  of  the  Information  Book  without"
"awarding an opportunity to the defence is wrong and contrary to law. Hence,"
"this ground also has merit."
"Further In the 10th ground of appeal, the Appellant claims that the Learned"
"Trial Judge was biased before to the final finding since he appeared to have"
"made a decision without conducting a thorough review and analysis of the"
"facts.  Thereby, the Learned Trial Judge had denied the Appellant a fair trial"
"guaranteed by the Constitution."
"The concept of fair trial is a fundamental principle in every judicial system."
"In another sense, the notion of a fair trial secures justice. A trial in criminal"
"jurisprudence is a judicial examination or determination of the issues at the"
"hand of the Court to arrive at a conclusion whether the accused is guilty of"
"the offence or not."
