"Furthermore,  the learned High Court Judge based her Order entirely on the observation  report,"
"which was made only in the presence of the aggrieved party. There was no representation made"
"by the Appellant. As such, it was alleged that the Police Sergeant tends to be biased in his report"
"as he comes to the conclusion that the Appellant has encroached the roadway without knowledge"
"of the original demarcation of the roadway. Therefore, the Order made by the learned High Court"
"Judge based on these observations are prejudicial towards the Appellant and a violation of natural"
"justice."
