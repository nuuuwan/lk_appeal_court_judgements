"The learned High Court Judge contended that the Petitioner had not objected to the arbitrator's"
"appointment. A perusal of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge revealed that ""a perusal"
"of the notes of the arbitrator which was annexed to the High Court marked as P5"" indicates that"
"Petitioners had consented to arbitration."
"T
he document ""P5"" was the arbitrator's notes on the first date. B.M. Gunasekera represented the"
"Petitioners. On that date, this appeal's 1st to 4th  and 6th Petitioners had been present before the"
"arbitrator."
"T
he 5th Petitioner, D.P. Mangala Hemamali, had sent a telegram to her representative seeking to"
"excuse  her  presence  and  consent  for  further  proceedings  in  her  absence.  Other  than  the  6th"
"Petitioner, other Petitioners who were Respondents before the arbitrator had signed denying the"
"charges read to them. Only after the denial that the inquiry commence."
"T
he Petitioners should have objected on that first date. They could have exercised their right by"
"objecting to the arbitrator before the second date. A perusal of the proceedings before the arbitrator"
"proves the observation of the learned High Court Judge."
"I
n Ismalebbe Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services1 held, ""In instances where the court"
"found that the Officer or authority has either not erred, or that the error did not vitiate jurisdiction,"
"certiorari  has  (unless  the  error  in  question  was  an  error  of  law  on  the  face  of  the  record)  been"
"refused."
"I
n this instance, the appointment and the proceedings before the arbitrator are according to law."
"The Petitioners had not succeeded in showing this court any irregularity of proceedings. The only"
"objection  to  the  appointment  of  the  3rd  Respondent  as  arbitrator  is  that  the  Petitioner  had  not"
"established a gross variation of rules of natural justice."
