"a certificate, for no fault of his own."
"N
onetheless, the Petitioner had applied for the post of Deputy General Manager"
"on a previous occasion, in the year 2018. In the document marked “R5” it is seen that the"
"interviews  for  the  post  of  Deputy  General  Manager  were  held  on  23rd  and 24th  August"
"2018.  The  Petitioner  had  ranked  13th  and  scored  83.70/100.  As  evident  from  his  letter"
"(marked “C2” dated 25th October 2018) to the Chairman/ General Manager of the Board"
"he  has  requested  for  the  marks  awarded  to  him  at  the  August  2018  interview  to  be"
"rectified.  In  that  letter,  he  states  he  should  have  been  awarded  more  marks  as  he"
"possessed the aforesaid qualifications. These are facts that were not forthcoming in the"

"the document marked “C5” from the University clearly explaining the fact of non-issuance"
"of  certificates  for  those  candidates  pursuing  an  MBA.  The  document  marked  “C6”  is"
"insufficient. It merely states that the Petitioner has completed the course work of the first"
"and second years of the MBA programme. Therefore, we are of the view that the Petitioner"
"cannot now challenge this when in fact he has acquiesced to the same."

"precluded from raising any objection to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Labour to"
