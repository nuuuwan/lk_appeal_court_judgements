"not be believed because this has not been even suggested to the PW1"
"on behalf of the appellant. The only suggestion put to the PW1 was that"
"the appellant was not there at the time of the incident. In addition, a"
"question  has  been  asked  whether  “Gamini  mama”  told  her  that  the"
"father was assaulted by “Sagara mama” which she denied. (page 124 of"
"the appeal brief). The motive that has not been suggested to PW1 and"
"that has not been stated by the appellant in his dock statement could"
"not be believed and has to be rejected. Hence, the argument that the"
"prosecution  had  fabricated  a  story  because  of  the  said  animosity,"
"necessarily fails."
