"The suit present in court is for the claim, then retaining the vessel and not allowing the owner to"
"generate income must have some rationality. In this instance, Plaintiff had not shown how his case"
"could be proved by retaining the vessel. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge had used his"
"discretion and decided the issue on a low-level test."
"H
ulse-Rutter and Others V. Godde (4) SA 1336 (S.C.A.), A South African case, discussed the test"
"to be applied."
"""The requirement of a prima facie case about attachments to find or confirm jurisdiction has over"
"the years been said to be satisfied if an applicant shows that there is evidence which, if accepted,"
"will establish a cause of action and that the mere fact that such evidence is contradicted will not"
"disentitle the Applicant to relief - not even if the probabilities are against him; it is only where it"
"is quite clear that the Applicant has no action, or cannot  succeed, that an attachment should be"
"refused""."
"T
he  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  followed  the  low-level  test  in  conjunction  with  the  above"
"findings of the South African case."
"A
s discussed above, the Plaintiff-Petitioner had allegations against the 2nd Defendant that he had"
"misrepresented facts and made Plaintiff believe that the vessel had a C.A.P. 1 rating. According to"
"the 2nd, Defendant only dealt with the Ceylon Petroleum Co-operation through its brokers and had"
"no communication with Plaintiff. The 2nd Defendant maintained that the charter party in question"
"was entered only between the second party and Ceylon Petroleum Co-operation. Plaintiff had no"
"place in that agreement."
"The learned High Court judge had observed that there were no papers to show communications"
"between the 2nd Defendant and the Plaintiff regarding this matter. The learned High Court judge"
"had further observed that the    E-mails were between the Ceylon Petroleum Co-operation and the"
"Plaintiff but not between the 2nd Defendant and the Plaintiff."
"R
egarding the document marked as ""X35"", the learned High Court Judge had observed that even"
"that document does not confirm the power to act as the agent of the Ceylon Petroleum Co-operation"
"to the Plaintiff before the charter party. A perusal of documents marked ""X34"", ""X35"", and ""X36"""
