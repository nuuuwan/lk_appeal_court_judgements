"ascertain the findings of the learned High Court Judge that those documents were issued after the"
"incident and just before the case was instituted. Therefore, those documents were to file in this"
"case only."
"W
hen perusing the documents, especially ""X35"", none establishes that the S.T.S. operation failed"
"due to the 2nd Defendant's fault. Those documents do not carry any wordings that can be considered"
"as the loss suffered by Plaintiff was due to misrepresentation made by the 2nd Defendant."
"W
hen  perusing  the  charter,  the  Ceylon  Petroleum  Co-operation  had  not  made  it  mandatory"
"regarding  the  S.I.R.F.  inspection.  Therefore,  the  finding  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  that"
"""Ceylon Petroleum Co-operation has not stated either in the document marked ""X35"" or in any"
"such document that the M.T. Agros was unable to carry out either the S.T.S. operations due to the"
"lack of C.A.P. 1 rating or SIRE inspection as claimed by the Plaintiff."
"There is no document to support Plaintiff's claim that the S.T.S. operation did not occur due to the"
"absence of C.A.P. rating ""1"" or lack of SIRE inspection"" which stands unchallenged. Even in this"
"court, the Plaintiff-Petitioner failed to show otherwise."
"P
laintiff  had  filed  this  case  without  giving  any  notice  of  dues  which  amounted  because  of  the"
"conduct  of  the  2nd  Defendant.  Therefore,  if  Plaintiff  fails  in  the  leading  case  since  he  is  not  a"
"resident of Sri Lanka, the 2nd Defendant will not be able to recover damages."
"I
t is the court's duty always to think from the view of safeguarding the parties' rights. The learned"
"High Court Judge must consider how to recover damages in a position where the Plaintiff loses."
"In this case, even though the evidence was evaluated on the face of the document forwarded, the"
"2nd Defendant has a  prima facie case. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge must safeguard the"
"claim or counterclaim of the 2nd Defendant. As the learned High Court Judge had observed, since"
"the  Plaintiff  is  not  a  resident  of  this  country,  it  is  a  precaution  to  order  the  Plaintiff  to  furnish"
"security."
