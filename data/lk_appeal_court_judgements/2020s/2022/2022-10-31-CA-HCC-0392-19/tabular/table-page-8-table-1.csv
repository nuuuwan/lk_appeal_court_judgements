"identification parade, it was in compliance with the basic standards of a parade"
"of this nature."
"The learned President’s Counsel pointed out that the learned High Court Judge"
"has failed to consider identification of a student who was not produced even for"
"an  informal  identification  parade  in  his  judgement.  It  was  his  view  that  non-"
"consideration  of  this  factor  which  was  a  matter  in  favour  of  the  1st  accused"
"appellant has caused prejudice to his client. It was his position that under the"
"circumstances, the contradiction in the evidence of the victim child where he has"
"stated when he made his statement to the National Child Protection Authority"
"that it was ‘සුදු අයියා’, meaning the 1st accused appellant that held him, and the"
"one who sexually abused him was ‘කලු අයියා’, meaning the 2nd accused appellant,"
"as a matter very much relevant in this action. It was his position that such a"
"vital  contradiction  is  a  contradiction  that  cannot  be  attributed  as  a  mere"

"Citing the judgement pronounced in James Silva Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka"
"(1980) 2 SLR 167, it was the argument of the learned President’s Counsel that"
"the learned High Court Judge was wrong in considering the evidence adduced"
"on behalf of the appellants in the light of the prosecution evidence. It was his"
"position that the learned High Court Judge has failed to properly evaluate the"
"evidence led in this action and failed to consider the matters favourable to the"
"appellants in the judgement. He was also of the view that the evidence whether"
"a  conspiracy  charged  can  be  maintained  has  also  not  been  considered  in  the"
"judgement."
"The learned Counsel for the 2nd accused appellant agreeing with the submissions"
"made  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  contended  that  the  identification  of"
"both the accused appellants were not proper and convicting the appellants based"
"on such identification has caused prejudice to the appellants."
