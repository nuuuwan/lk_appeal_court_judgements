"necessary for the adjudication of that action, the such commission can"
"be issued to the same commissioner who made the preliminary plan."
"It cannot be issued to another surveyor. In the case in hand, the Court"
"had  issued  another  commission  to  another  surveyor  which  is  quite"
"contrary to the provisions of the Partition Law."
"An action for partition of land is an action in rem. When the decree in"
"a  partition  action  is  entered,  it  is  a  decree  in  rem  which  binds  the"
"whole world and not only the parties to the partition action. It will be"
"effective  at  all  times.  That  is  the  vital  point  and  the  basis  for  the"
"Partition  Law  being  enacted.  The  provisions  are  imperative.  Going"
"beyond the provisions of the Partition Law is not a technical matter as"
"alleged by the appellants’ Counsel in his written submissions. The fact"
"that the parties to the action had agreed to go ahead with the 2nd plan"
"done  by  another  commissioner  when  the  application  to  do  so  was"
"made  by  the  Plaintiffs  of  the  case  at  the  trial  and  the  Court  had"
"allowed the same, is no reason to be regarded to support the judgment"
"of the trial Court. It was erroneous to accept the 2nd plan. The District"
"Court was wrong in having accepted the 2nd plan done by a different"
"surveyor.  The  provisions  of  the  Partition  Law  are  mandatory  and"
"should  be  followed  in  every  step  of  the  way  in  any  partition  action"
"before the District Court. The argument of the appellants that it is only"
"a technical matter fails…………..”"
