"After the conclusion of the prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge"
"had called for the defence. As the Appellant was tried in absentia the case"
"was closed without adducing any evidence on behalf of the Appellant. After"
"considering  the  evidence  presented,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had"
"convicted the Appellant under Section 300 of the Penal Code and sentenced"
"him  to  two  years  rigorous  imprisonment  with  a  fine  of  Rs.1000/-  with  a"
"default sentence of two months simple imprisonment."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  aforesaid  conviction  and  sentence  the  Appellant"
"preferred this appeal to this court."
"The  Counsel  for  the  Appellant,  U.  R.  De  Silva,  P.C.  had  filed  a  motion  on"
"28/03/2022 indicating that he receives no instructions from the Appellant"
"and there is no way of contacting him as he was absconding throughout the"
"trial as well as during the period of this appeal. As such, the counsel wishes"
"to  withdraw  from  this  appeal.  This  position  was  endorsed  by  his  junior"
"counsel who appeared before this court on that day."
"Hence,  the  court  decided  to  adjudicate  this  matter  based  on  the  written"
"submissions filed by the parties. The ASG, who appeared for the Respondent"
"have no objection."
"As no separate grounds of the Appeal filed by the Appellant, this court has"
"decided  to  adjudicate  this  appeal  on  following  grounds  extracted  from  the"
"written submission filed on behalf of the Appellant."
