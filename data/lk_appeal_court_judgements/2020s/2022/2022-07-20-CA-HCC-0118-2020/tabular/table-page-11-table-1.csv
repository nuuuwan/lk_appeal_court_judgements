"be capable of creating a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case."
"Hence, I agree that the failure to properly  consider the dock statement of"

"reasonable doubt on the prosecution story."
"The Appellant’s mother Leelawathie giving evidence on behalf of the defence"
"confirmed  that  the  police  officers  had  come  to  her  house  on  the  date  of"
"arrest of the Appellant, searched the house and taken the Appellant to the"
"Colombo  Crime  Division 
to  record  a  statement.  According 
to  her 
the"
"Appellant was wearing only a sarong when the police apprehended him and"
"he did not have anything in his possession when he was taken away by the"
"police.  Her  evidence  was  not  subjected 
to  cross  examination  by 
the"
"prosecution."
