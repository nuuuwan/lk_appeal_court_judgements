"In  the  second  ground  of  appeal  the  Appellant  contends  that  the  learned"
"Trial Judge had failed to appreciate the inconsistency between the evidence"
"given by PW1 and PW2 as to how they discovered the identity and or alias"
"of the Appellant."
"According  to  PW1  the  appellant  was  arrested  randomly  without  any  prior"
"information. In his evidence he has categorically stated that the identity of"
"the appellant was revealed only after his arrest. Hence, it was the position"
"of PW1 that the Appellant is a stranger to him at the time of the arrest."
"On  this  point,  upon  examination  of  the  evidence  given  by  PW2,  he  had"
"stated  that  the  identity  with  alias  name  of  the  Appellant  was  intimated  to"
"the police team by PW1 IP/Chandana who had headed the team. This is a"
"very contradictory position taken by PW1 and PW2."
"In the cross examination PW2 has given evidence as follows:"
