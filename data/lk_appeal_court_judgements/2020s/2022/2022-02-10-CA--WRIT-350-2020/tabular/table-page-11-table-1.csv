"of non-compliance with the procedure laid down by statute or failure to comply with"
"the rules of natural justice or mandatory procedure."
"In the landmark decision of  Council of  Civil  Service Union v. Minister for  the Civil"
"Service  (GCHQ  Case)4,  Lord  Diplock  stipulated  the  grounds  of  Judicial  Review  as"
"follows,"
"“Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without reiterating any"
"analysis of the steps by which the development has come about, one can conveniently"
"classify under three heads the grounds upon which administrative action is subject to"
"control by judicial review."
"The  first  ground  I  would  call  “illegality,”  the  second  “irrationality”  and  the  third"
"“procedural impropriety.”"
"By “illegality” as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-maker must"
"understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give"
"effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable question to be decided,"
"in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the"
"state is exercisable."
"I  have  described  the  third  head  as  “procedural  impropriety”  rather  than  failure  to"
"observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural fairness towards"
"the person who will be affected by the decision. This is because susceptibility to judicial"
"review  under  this  head  covers  also  failure  by  an  administrative  tribunal  to  observe"
"procedural rules that are expressly laid down in the legislative instrument by which its"
"jurisdiction is conferred, even where such failure does not involve any denial of natural"
"justice….”"
"In the instant action, since no Notice has been exhibited under section 2 of the Act in"
"the area which the impugned land is situated, I hold that the attempts of the Respondents"
"4 (1985) AC 374(HL) at page 950 and 951."
