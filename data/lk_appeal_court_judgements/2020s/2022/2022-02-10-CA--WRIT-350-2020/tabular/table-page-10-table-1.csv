"evidence  to  establish  that  the  impugned  land  is  situated  outside  the  area  which  the"
"section 2 Notice relates."
"When considering all the above stated facts  and circumstances,  it is  evident that the"
"impugned land owned by the Petitioner is situated not within the area which the section"
"2 Notice was exhibited and at the time of exhibiting the Notice the Respondents had no"
"intention  to  identify  a  land  in  the  area  which  the  impugned  land  is  situated  for"
"acquisition. In terms of the proviso (a) to the section 38 it is a mandatory requirement"
"that before making an Order to recover possession of a land section 2 Notices should"
"be exhibited."
"In their book on Administrative Law, H. W. R Wade and C. F Forsyth articulate that,"
"“Procedural safeguards, which are so often imposed for the benefit of persons affected"
"by the exercise of administrative powers, are normally regarded as mandatory, so that"
"it is fatal to disregard them….”2"
"Furthermore, Alex Carroll elaborates that,"
"“A mandatory procedural requirement must be complied with if the action or decision"
"taken is to be valid in law. As a general principle such a requirement will be regarded"
"as mandatory if non-compliance with it might cause substantial prejudice to the person"
"or persons affected by the exercise of  the power. The requirement  will  usually have"
"been imposed to improve the quality of the decision-making process.”3"
"The cardinal  principle  of  ultra  vires  is  of two forms  i.e., substantive ultra  vires and"
"procedural ultra vires. Procedural ultra vires is the declaration of invalidity for reason"
