"Since the dispute between the parties is relating to a roadway, it appears that Section 69 of the"
"Primary Courts’ Procedure Act is applicable and according to Section 69 of the Act, there is no"
"necessity to consider the availability of an alternative roadway."
"The learned Primary Court Judge had determined that the 1st and 3rd Respondents had not proved"
"the fact that the roadway was used for more than 10 years, and thereby as not being entitled to"
"claim their ownership by way of prescription. The learned Primary Court Judge has further stated"
"that even the 3rd Petitioner had not established her rights to use the disputed roadway."
"By virtue of Section 69 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, there is no need to prove rights as"
"it  is  done  in  a  civil  suit.  The  case  Ramalingam  Vs.  Thangarajah  [1982]  2SLR  693  held  the"
