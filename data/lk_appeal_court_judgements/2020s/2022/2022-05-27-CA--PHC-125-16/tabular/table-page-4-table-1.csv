"Judge of Tangalle in case bearing No.11522 dated 25.07.2013 and had permitted the 1st and 3rd"
"Respondents to use 10 feet wide-10 meters long roadway over the subject matter."
"Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 17.10.2016, the Appellant had preferred this appeal to"
"revise and/or to set aside the Order pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial"
"High Court of Tangalle."
"The impugned roadway is described as Lot M in Plan No. 226 dated 12.03.1965, in schedule to"
"the Petition dated 31.10.2016. According to 1st and 3rd Respondents, the impugned roadway was"
"used by them as access to Lot L in plan No. 226.  However, on or above 16.01.2013 the Appellant"
"had obstructed the said roadway."
"It was submitted by the Appellant that there is no roadway over lot M as access to lot L and that"
"there is a separate road providing access to the said lot L according to the said plan. It was the"
"contention of the Appellant that there was no such roadway over the said lot M and that Appellant"
"is in possession of all the lots namely M, N, O, P, Q, R and T."
"The  attention  of  Court  was  drawn  to  the  document  marked  as  3V1  and  3V2.  3V1  is  the  final"
"Partition  Decree  in  case  bearing  No.  P  717,  and  it  was  submitted  to  substantiate  that  the  3rd"
"Respondent’s mother has obtained ownership to the portions of land; lot M and lot N. However, it"
"appears that the disputed roadway cuts across lot M according to the said plan 226 marked as 3V2."
"Therefore, the Respondents contended that the Appellant is not the lawful owner of lot M and N"
"in plan 3V2 and admitted the Appellant has ownership only to the portions of land in lots O, P, Q"
"and R. As such, it is apparent that the Appellant had unlawfully blocked the impugned roadway"
"over lot M, which the 1st and 3rd Respondents had been using as access to their lot L in plan 3V2."
"When considering the affidavits and the counter affidavits of the parties to this case, it is seen that"
"the 1st Respondent’s husband is an owner of a three-wheeler and has further stated that they did"
"not have an alternate roadway to get the three-wheeler into the 1st Respondent’s premises."
"It was stated by the Appellant that the 1st Respondent has an alternative road way to enter their"
"premises. However, Primary Court may not have considered the availability of an alternative right"
"of  way,  if  there  was  any,  to  deny  the  right  of  way  used  by  the  Respondents  over  the  disputed"
