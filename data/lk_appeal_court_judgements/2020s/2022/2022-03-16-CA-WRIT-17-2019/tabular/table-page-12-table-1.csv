"has categorically emphasized that the ‘no evidence’ rule has now been firmly established"
"as a ground of judicial review. The said authors state;"
"“Despite lack of any decision reviewing the old authorities against a ‘no evidence’ rule, it"
"seems clear that this ground of judicial review is now firmly established. There have been so"
"many  sporadic  references  to  it  on  this  assumption,  and  it  conforms  so  well  to  the  other"
"developments  in  administrative  law,  that  the  older  authorities  to  the  contrary,  impressive"
"though they are, must now be consigned to the scrapheap of history. ‘No evidence’ thus takes"
"its place as yet a further branch of the principle of ultra vires."
"The  time  is  ripe  for  this  development  as  part  of  the  judicial  policy  of  preventing  abuse  of"
"discretionary power. To find facts without evidence is itself an abuse of power and a source of"
"injustice, and it ought to be within the scope of judicial review. This is recognized in other"
"jurisdiction  where  the  grounds  of  review  have  been  codified  by  statue.  In  Australia  the"
"Administrative  Decisions  (Judicial  Review)  Act  1977  expressly  authorises  review  on  the"
"ground  that  there  was  ‘no  evidence  or  other  material’  to  justify  the  decision  where  some"
"particular  matter  has  to  be  established  1,  and  a  somewhat  analogous  provision  has  been"
"enacted in Canada2.”"
