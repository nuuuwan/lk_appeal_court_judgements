"The Article 8(1)(d):  the value of any part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal"
"or use of the imported goods that accrues directly or indirectly to the seller."
"The  tenor  of  the  arguments  of  the  Respondents  is  that,  the  continuing  fee  which  is"
"calculated as 6% of revenues and the advertising contribution which is calculated as 5% of"
"the revenues are part of the proceeds of subsequent resale, disposal or use of the goods"
"imported by the Petitioner and such proceeds accrues directly or indirectly to the Seller."
"As opposed to such argument, the Petitioners’ deliberation is that the said continuing fee"
"is remitted by the Petitioner to the Franchisor solely for the grant of the Franchise which"
"entails  the  right  to  use  the  system,  system  property  and  marks  as  defined  in  the  IFA"
"(marked ‘P4’) and accordingly, it does not in any way relate to the imported goods which"
"the  Petitioner  purchases  from  the  Seller  through  transactions  that  are  separate  to  and"
"independent  from  the  IFA.  Petitioner  further  argues  that  it  does  not  engage  in  any"
"advertising activity upon the items it purchases from the Seller other than advertising the"
"end products and services sold to customers at outlets. Therefore, the Petitioner’s assertion"
"is that the remittance of continuing fee and expenses of the advertising contribution are"
"wholly unrelated to and unconnected with the imported goods in question."
"At  this  stage,  I  need  to  advert  to  the  issue  as  to  whether  there  is  any  link  between  the"
"‘continuing fee’ in IFA and the ‘royalties’ mentioned in the said Article 1. Although, the"
"provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 are not applicable to this case, the"
"connotation of the word ‘annuity’ embodied in sections 3, 26, 32, 34 and 95 of the said"
"Act, in my view, can be made an influence to the questions under review. Annuity is a"
"right to receive periodic payments that is created by a contract or other legal documents."
"Hence,  it  can  be  assumed  that,  the  annuity  is  akin  to  royalty  or  to  the  continuity  fee"
"referred to in this application. Lord Denham made a comparison between the rent paid"
"under an agricultural lease and the royalties paid under a mining lease in the case of Queen"
"vs. Westbrook 116 ER 69,  where  he  has  said;  “royalty  is  in  substance  a  rent;  it  is  the"
"compensation which the occupier pays the landlord for that species of occupation which the contract"
"between them allows”. (Vide - E. Gooneratne, Income Tax in Sri Lanka, 2nd Edition, [2009])"
"However, on a careful examination of the provisions of Article 8(1)(c) indicates that the"
"royalty and license fees related to the goods are to be added to the price actually paid or"
