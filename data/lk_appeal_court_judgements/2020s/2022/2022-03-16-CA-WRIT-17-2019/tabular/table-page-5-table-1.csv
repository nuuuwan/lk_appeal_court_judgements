"purchase  price  of  the  imports.  Therefore,  the  Petitioner  submits  that  no  part  of  the"
"continuing fee or advertising contribution accrues directly or indirectly to the Seller."
"However, the Respondents referring to clause 5.3 of the IFA submitted that the Petitioner"
"is bound to purchase the supplies, materials, equipment and services used in the business"
"exclusively from suppliers and using distributors who have been approved in writing by"
"Franchisor.  Respondents  further  submitted  that    the  Manual  issued  by  the  Franchisor,"
"marked ‘1R1’ (marked at the inquiry as ‘P7’) describe the (a) manufacture, (b) storage, (c)"
"transfer from one place to another, (d) supply & distribution and (e) all other processes"
"and  procedures  in  minute  detail  and  accordingly,  there  is  no  arms-length  negotiations"
"possible  with  the  Seller  at  the  prevailing  market  conditions  since  the  (i)  items  to  be"
"purchased, (ii) the suppliers and (iii) quality of the items have already been pre-decided by"
"the Franchisor. Therefore, the Respondents’ contention is that, it cannot be said that the"
"Sellers are independent, separate and distinct persons from the Franchisor as the quality"
"of the items are monitored from the initial stages to the end product by way of a stand-red"
"audit system."
"Moreover, the argument of the Respondents is that, in view of the said Manual there has"
"to  be  some  sort  of  an  agreement  between  the  Petitioner  and  Seller  for  the  Seller  to"
"accommodate  a  procedure  of  manufacture  of  end  products  to  such  scrutiny  by  the"
"Franchisor and no such agreement has been tendered at the inquiry. The Respondents’"
"argument  is  based  on  the  nature  of  monitoring  of supply  and  distribution  and  all  other"
"processes  by  the  Franchisor  as  enunciated  in  the  said  manual  marked  ‘1R1’.  Another"
"contention of the Respondent is that, the Petitioner does not pay the purchase price to the"
"Seller and only the shipper is being paid with the purchase price as revealed by the sales"
"invoices and also that the amount of control exercised by the Franchisor over the Sellers"
"indicates that some part of the revenue from such sales accrues to the Franchisor making"
"the Franchisor de-facto Seller."
"I now advert to the legal background in respect of the ‘transaction value’ which is the price"
"actually paid or payable to the Seller by the consignee (Petitioner) for the goods (such as"
"cheese, tomato paste, dough blend etc.,) exported to Sri Lanka. The succinct issue in this"
"matter is whether the 6% of continuing fee and 5% of advertising contribution made to the"
"Franchisor by the Franchisee (the consignee at this instant) should be added to the said"
"transaction value."
