"of the interpretative notes to Article 8 at paragraph 3 (published in Extraordinary Gazette"
"Notification No. 1335/25 dated 10.04.2004). The said Interpretative note reads;"
"“Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to"
"be made under the provisions of Article 8, the transaction value cannot be determined under"
"the provisions of Article 1. As an illustration of this, royalty is paid on the basis of the price"
"in a sale in Sri Lanka of a liter of a particular product that was imported by the kilogram"
"and made up into a solution after importation. If the royalty based partially on the imported"
"goods and partially on other factors which have nothing to do with the imported goods (such"
"as  when  the  imported  goods  are  mixed  with  the  domestic  ingredients  and  are  no  longer"
"separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished from  special financial"
"arrangements between the buyer and the seller), it would be inappropriate to attempt"
"to make an addition for the royalty. However, if the amount of this royalty is based only"
"on the imported goods and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid"
"or payable can be made.” (Emphasis added)"
