"Thereafter,  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  adhering  to  the  legal  principle"
"that  is  necessary  had  proceeded  to  consider  the  dock  statement,  of  the"
"Appellant  and  had  arrived  at  the  conclusion  that  the  dock  statement  had"
"not caused any impact on the prosecution case. This is not an instance of"
"shifting of the burden of proof to the Appellant as claimed by the Learned"
"President’s Counsel."
"Thereafter,  the  Learned  High  Court  judge  had  moved  on  to  consider  the"
"evidence  critically  and  arrived  at  the  finding  that  the  prosecution  had"
"proved  their  case  against  the  Appellant  beyond  reasonable  doubt.  He  had"
"given reasons as to why he accepted the prosecution case and rejected the"
"defence case."
"The  Learned  President’s  Counsel  submits  that  the  entire  approach  of  the"
"Learned  High  Court  Judge  is  flawed  from  the  very  commencement  of  the"
"judgment."
"In  this  case  the  approach  adopted  by  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  does"
"accord with the provision of Section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure"
"Act  No.15  of  1979.  As  such,  it  is  appropriate  to  consider  this  case  under"
"Section  436  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  No.15  of  1979  and"
"proviso  of  Article  138  of  The  Constitution  of  the  Democratic  Socialist"
