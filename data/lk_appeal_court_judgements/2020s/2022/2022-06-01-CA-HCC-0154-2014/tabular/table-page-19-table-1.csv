"According to PW11 the deceased had gone up the stairs from  the 4th floor"
"around  10.00  a.m.  A  few  minutes  later,  the  deceased  had  come  down  the"
"stairs with the Appellant and was seen getting onto the 4th floor lift."
"PW32  had  seen  the  deceased  following  the  Appellant  out  of  the  clinic  and"
"the two of them returning to the clinic with the book around 10.30 a.m."
"The above-mentioned prosecution witnesses are not expert witnesses. They"
"are ordinary members of the society who never expect to be called in to give"
"evidence  before  a  court  about  these  seemingly  routine  occurrences  that"
"happen  during  their  work  shift.  All  the  witnesses  had  referred  to  a  rough"
"time stamp without actually having verified it with an accurate clock. These"
"witnesses had observed the movements of the deceased alone and with the"
"Appellant inside the hospital. They had not had any advantage of looking at"
"notes or books when they gave evidence."
