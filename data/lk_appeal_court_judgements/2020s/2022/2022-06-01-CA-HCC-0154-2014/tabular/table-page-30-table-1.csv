"and a pair of trousers and pair of slippers as a common man. As PW1 did"
"not know the name of the Appellant but only knew him as a doctor serving"
"in the operating theatre, the identification parade was held to establish the"
"correct  identity  of  the  Appellant.  Up  to  the  point  of  the  incident  PW1  had"
"known the Appellant for about two years. The Appellant had not raised any"
"objection regarding holding the identification parade except the fact that he"
"had worked in five wards in the Negombo Base Hospital for about one year"
"and therefore, majority of the minor staff had been accustomed to him."
