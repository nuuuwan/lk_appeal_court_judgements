"The  defence  had  suggested  to  the  CID  officer  during  cross  examination  that  the  police"
"mercilessly  assaulted  the  appellant,  broke  his  teeth  and  took  his  statement  by  force.  The"
"police witness had answered this question in the negative and stated that the appellant was"
"produced before the JMO before he was remanded. This position had not been challenged by"
"the defence and no evidence had been tendered to prove the allegation of assault."
"The appellant had failed to deny, comment or explain the lie that the prosecution alleged he"
"had uttered in taking up an alibi. The position taken up in the dock statement had not been"
"put  to  the  prosecution  witnesses  in  cross  examination.  The  evidence  of  the  prosecution"
"witnesses  had  not  been  challenged  and  or  discredited  by  the  defence  during  the  cross"
"examination.  This  failure  amounts  to  the  acceptance  of  the  truth  of  the  prosecution"
"witnesses' version."
"For the aforesaid reasons it is my view that the appellant had failed to create a doubt in the"
"prosecution case. The prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt."
"For all these reasons the conviction of the appellant is affirmed. Having regard to the facts"
"and legal principles involved in the present matter in question, this appeal has failed to hold"
"any  merit.  Thus,  the  conviction  and  the  sentence  dated  11.08.2016  should  stand  and"
"therefore is affirmed."
