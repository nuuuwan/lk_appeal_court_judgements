"I will now consider the other ground adduced by the learned Trial Judge to reject the accused-"
"appellant's  evidence.  When  I.  P.  Liyanage  was  giving  evidence,  learned  defence  counsel"
"suggested  to  him  that  he  came  from  the  adjoining  land  but,  when  accused-appellant  was"
"giving evidence, he took up the position that while I. P. Liyanage was questioning him, he (I."
"P. Liyanage) instructed two officers to go to the adjoining land and they brought a  parcel."
"Therefore, it appears there is a discrepancy between the suggestion and the evidence of the"
"accused-appellant."
"This was one of the grounds to reject the accused-appellant's evidence. When we consider"
"the accused appellant's evidence, it appears that he had given consistent evidence on this"
"point. He says that I. P. Liyanage instructed two officers to go to the other land and little later"
"the two officers brought a parcel. He has been subjected to lengthy cross examination. But in"
"our view his evidence has not been shaken by the cross-examination. When I consider the"
"evidence  of  the  accused-appellant,  I  hold  the  view  that  there  is  no  reason  to  reject  the"
"accused-appellant's evidence. Learned Trial Judge without properly evaluating the accused-"
"appellant's evidence rejected his evidence on the above two grounds."
"The accused -appellant, in his evidence, admitted that he was a heroin addict. It appears that"
"he had honestly admitted that he had two previous convictions, where he was fined Rs 4000/="
"(four thousand rupees). Accused-appellant, in his evidence, stated that when he was taken to"
"the Police Narcotic Bureau he was suffering from the withdrawal of heroin and I. P. Liyanage"
"gave him six packets of heroin. It appears that he has honestly admitted all these facts before"
"the learned Trial Judge. When we consider his evidence, we hold that there is no reason to"
"reject  the evidence of  the accused-appellant. Learned  Trial Judge, in our  view, was  wrong"
"when he rejects the accused appellant's evidence. What is the position if the court believes"
"the evidence of the accused-appellant or is of the opinion that the evidence of the accused"
"appellant creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case?"
"In this connection the Judgment of His Lordship Justice T.S. Fernando in Ariyadasa Vs. Queen"
