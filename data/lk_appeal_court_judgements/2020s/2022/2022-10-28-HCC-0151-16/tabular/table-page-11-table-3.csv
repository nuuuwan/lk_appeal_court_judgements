"E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, THE LAW OF EVIDENCE, VOLUME I on page 612 says as follows; The",""
"Indian Supreme Court considered the use of the evidence of a medical expert and stated;",""
"i.","If the evidence of the medical expert is that the injury seen by him on the body of"
"","the deceased could have been caused in the manner and by the weapon described"
"","by the eyewitness, his evidence lends assurance to the evidence of the eyewitness"
"","and makes it safe to act upon it, provided that such witness is otherwise found to"

"ii.","If the expert says that the injury examined by him could not have been caused in"
"","the manner or by the weapon stated by the witness, the medical evidence throws"
"","a grave doubt on the evidence of the witness, and ordinarily the former should be"
"","relied upon, even though the latter may not suffer from any other infirmity."
"iii.","If the court finds for any reason that the direct evidence is unreliable, the medical"
"","witness  ceases  to  be  of  any  use  in  the  case  and  cannot  be  of  any  use  to  the"
"","prosecution,  even  though  the  doctor  might  have  said  that  the  injury  could  have"
"","been caused as described by the witness, because the question of corroborative"
"","support  from  medical  evidence  can  arise  only  when  the  direct  evidence  is  first"
"","found to be otherwise reliable and not till then."
