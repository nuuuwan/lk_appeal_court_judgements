"caused miscarriage of Justice against the accused-appellant."
"The very reason the accused-appellant is connected to the alleged crime is, his DNA was found"
"in the vaginal swabs recovered from the deceased and for that he has given an explanation"
"making  a  statement  from  the  dock.  He  admitted  that  he  had  intercourse  with  the  corpus"
"found lying fallen on the bushy ground as he was making his way to harvest pepper seeds"
"early hours of that day. He couldn't notice any sign of living, having conceived sexual desire,"
"has prompted him to engage with sexual intercourse with the corpus. Learned counsel for the"
"appellant says that having an indecent act or rather sexual intercourse with a dead body does"
"not constitute the offence of rape."
"On  behalf  of  the  accused-appellant  it  was  further  submitted  that  the  Learned  High  Court"
"Judge misdirected herself by failing to properly analyse the dock statement on correct legal"
"and  factual  context  when  she  made  remarks 
in  her 
judgment.  The  Trial  Judge 
in  fact"
"introduced certain materials that was prejudicial to the accused as they were stated in the"
"dock  statement.  One  most  detrimental  material  introduced  was  that  ""the  deceased  was"
"slightly breathing"" which was not stated by the accused-appellant in his dock statement. It"
"was agued on behalf of the appellant that the above introduction clearly demonstrate that"
"the learned High Court Judge ventured into materials to convict the accused-appellant than"
"being reasonable when analysing the evidence."
"Apart  from  that  when  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  establish  its  case  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt, the Learned High Court Judge rejected the dock statement on the basis, accused has"
"failed  to  mention  of  another  person  being  part  of  the  crime  if  he  knew.  The  rejection  of"
"defence version on that ground is not permitted in Law."
"In W. M. R. B. Wijeratne and Others Vs. Attorney General 2010 Vol 1 BLR 109, it was held by"
"the full bench of the Supreme court that;"
"""the 
inclusion  of  reasons

judgment  cater  to  two  distinct  situations;  Public"
"accountability and need to know. An acceptable judgment must indicate the Judge's"

"held  thus,  ""It  is  interesting  to  find  out  the  reason  for  the  rejection  of  the  evidence  of  the"
"accused-appellant  by  the  learned  Trial  Judge.  When  I.  P.  Liyanage  was  giving  evidence,"
"learned defence counsel suggested to him that I. P. Liyanage used a wire to assault the wife"
"of the accused-appellant. But when accused-appellant was giving evidence, he stated that I."
"P. Liyanage used an antenna wire to assault his wife. The learned Trial Judge observed the"
"difference between the wire and the antenna wire and proceeded to reject the evidence of"
"the appellant. This was one of the grounds to reject the evidence of the accused-appellant by"
"the learned Trial Judge. The above ground, in our view, is not a ground to reject the evidence"
"of the accused-appellant. Learned Deputy Solicitor General too submits that he is unable to"
"agree with the said ground to reject the accused appellant's evidence."
