"the prosecution rests its case on circumstantial evidence, the inference of guilt can be"
"justified  only  when  all  the  incriminating  facts  and  circumstances  are  found  to  be"
"incompatible with the innocence of the accused"""

"of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion"
"consistent  with  the  innocence  of  the  accused  and  it  must  be  such  as  to  show  that"
