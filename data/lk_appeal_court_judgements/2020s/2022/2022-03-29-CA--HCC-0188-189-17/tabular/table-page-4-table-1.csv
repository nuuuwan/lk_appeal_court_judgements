"before  the  District  Court  of  Anuradhapura  between  Sumith  Bodhinayake  and"
"PW-01 fixed for the day of the incident, namely, 25-01-2002."
"The  deceased  had  accompanied  her  daughter-in-law  Nirosha  Dilrukshi  to  the"
"Court  and  she  was  with  her  grandson  outside  of  the  Court  while  PW-01  was"
"inside the Court house attending to the divorce case. Upon hearing some noise"
"PW-01 has come out of the Court house and had seen people running towards a"
"direction  of  an  incident.  When  she  reached  the  place  where  the  incident  took"
"place, she found her mother-in-law and her husband who was the other injured"
"namely Sumith Bodhinayake with bleeding injuries. It is in evidence that upon"
"admission to the hospital the deceased was pronounced dead."
"PW-08  was  the  police  officer  who  was  engaged  in  guard  duties  at  the  main"
"entrance of the Court. While on duty, he has heard 4 or 5 gunshot sounds from"
"the direction of his left-hand side. Upon hearing the sound, he has readied his"
"T56 weapon and gone towards the direction where the sound came and he has"
"seen  a  person  running  holding  a  pistol  in  his  hand  and  getting  into  a  three-"
"wheeler. He has seen the three-wheeler speeding towards the airport. PW-08 has"
"fired two shots towards the three-wheeler which has struck its front windscreen."
"He  has  observed  the  three-wheeler  as  a  cream-coloured  vehicle.    However,"
"despite of the shots fired, the three-wheeler had fled the scene."
"PW-08 was specific in his evidence that he could not identify the person who ran"
"and got into the three-wheeler. It was his evidence before the High Court that he"
"could not identify the person even at the identification parade held in that regard."
"It  was  also  his  evidence  that  there  was  another  person  who  drove  the  three-"
"wheeler but could not identify him either."
"Evidence of PW-12 was of no importance as he has neither seen the incident nor"
"has seen the person who shot at the deceased and the injured."
"At  the  trial,  the  doctor  who  examined  the  injured  Sumith  Bodhinayake  has"
"confirmed that injuries suffered by him are a result of gunshot wounds inflicted"
