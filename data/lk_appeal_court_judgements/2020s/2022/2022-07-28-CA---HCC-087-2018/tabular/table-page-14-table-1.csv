xamination.  The  daughter  of  the  appellant  was  called  as  a  defence  witness."
"She  said  that  her  father,  the  appellant  came  only  half  an  hour  after  the"
"incident.  However,  in  her  statement  to  the  police,  she  had  stated  that  her"
"father had come running to the place of the incident.  She denied making such"
"a statement. That portion of that statement was marked by the prosecution as"
"a contradiction and showed that her position was different earlier."
"The argument that the learned High Court Judge has not considered the dock"
"statement properly, has no merit."
"For  the  reasons  set  out  in  this  judgment,  I  see  no  reasonable  ground  to"
"interfere with the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 2018.05.10."
"The  appeal  of  the  appellant  is  dismissed.    The  conviction  and  the  sentence"
"imposed on the appellant is affirmed."
