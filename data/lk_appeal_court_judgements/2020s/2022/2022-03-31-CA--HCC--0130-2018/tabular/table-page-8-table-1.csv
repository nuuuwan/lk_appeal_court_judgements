"contradictions which do not touch the core of a party’s case should not"

"In Iswari Prasad v. Mohamed Isa 1963 AIR (SC) 1728 at 1734 His Lordship"
"held that;"
"“In considering the question as to whether evidence given by the witness"
"should be accepted or not, the court has, no doubt, to examine whether"
"the witness is an interested witness and to enquire whether the story"
"deposed to by him is probable and whether it has been shaken in cross-"
"examination. That is - whether there is a ring of truth surrounding his"
"testimony.”"
"In  this  case  the  victim  had  given  evidence  without  any  contradiction  or"
"omission  in  the  trial.  As  the  evidence  of  the  victim  passed  the  test  of"
"probability and credibility, I conclude that this appeal ground also has no"
"merit."
"The final ground advanced by the Appellant is that the rejection of the case"
"for the defence on unreasonable grounds."
"The Learned High Court Judge in her judgement very extensively considered"
"the defence position advanced in this case. She has given reasons as to why"
"she is rejecting the defence’s version and accepting the prosecution’s version."
"There are no any unreasonable grounds on which the Learned High Court"
"Judge  had  rejected  the  defence.  The  sole  reason  for  the  acceptance  of  the"
"prosecution case is that the prosecution case has passed all the tests without"
"any doubt or ambiguity. Hence, I conclude that this ground is also devoid of"
"any merits."
"Rape is generally regarded as one of the gravest forms of sexual offences. It"
"violates  and  degrades  a  fellow  human  being.  The  physical  and  emotional"
"trauma of the victim are likely to be severe."
