"In this case a child was raped. Society cannot condone any form of sexual"
"assault on children. The courts have a positive obligation under the law to"
"protect them from sexual abuse. Hence sexual offenders must be dealt with"
"severely."
"On  perusal  of  the  judgement  of  the  trial  judge,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the"
"appeal grounds advanced by the Appellant are devoid of any merit and I see"
"no reason to interfere with the judgment dated 19/03/2018."
"Therefore,  the  conviction  and  the  sentence  are  affirmed  and  the  appeal  is"
"dismissed."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  of  Monaragala  is  hereby  directed  to  issue"
"notice  on  the  Appellant  to  appear  before  the  High  Court,  as  he  is  on  bail"
"pending appeal, and to comply with this judgement."
