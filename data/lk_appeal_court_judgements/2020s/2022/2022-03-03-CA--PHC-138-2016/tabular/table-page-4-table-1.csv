"Apparently, the learned High Court Judge by his order dated 21.03.2013 sent the case back to the"
"Magistrate’s Court of Walasmulla to re-hear the matter and to make an appropriate order by taking"
"into consideration all the evidence and documentation produced by either party."
"U
pon the matter being sent back to the Magistrate’s Court of Walasmulla, the learned Magistrate"
"who acted as the Primary Court Judge after taking into consideration all the evidence, delivered"
"the order dated 20.02.2015 in favour of the Respondent, on the premise that the Respondent was"
"in possession of the disputed land two months prior to the date of filing of the information in terms"
"of Section 68 (1) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act."
"B
eing dissatisfied with the said order, the Appellant had preferred a revision application bearing"
"No. HCRA 04/2015 to the Provincial High Court of Tangalle, seeking to revise or set aside the"
"said order dated 20.02.2015."
"C
onsequently, the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle after hearing both parties, affirmed the"
"order dated 20.02.2015, by the learned Magistrate of Walasmulla and dismissed the said revision"
"application by order dated 27.10.2016 with costs fixed at Rs. 10,500/-."
"A
gainst the said order dated 27.10.2016 of the Provincial High Court of Tangalle, the Appellant"
"has preferred this appeal to the Court of Appeal."
"W
hen this matter was taken up for argument, on behalf of the 1st Party-Respondent-Respondent, a"
"preliminary objection was raised as to the maintainability of the instant appeal on the basis that the"
"appeal  made  against  the  order  dated  27.10.2016  made  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  of  the"
"Provincial High Court of Tangalle in revision application bearing No. 4/2015 is not a final order."
"It was the position taken up by the Respondent that the impugned order dated 27.10.2016 is  an"
"interlocutory order, thus no appeal lies against the same."
"I
t appears that when the Appellants preferred the revision application bearing No. 4/2015 to the"
"Provincial High Court of Tangalle against the order dated 20.02.2015 by the learned Magistrate of"
"Walasmulla, they had failed to tender the duly certified copies of the documents of the Magistrate"
