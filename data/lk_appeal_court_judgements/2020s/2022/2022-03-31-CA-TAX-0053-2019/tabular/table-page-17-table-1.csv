"","The issue as to whether the Appellant satisfies the requirements imposed",""
"","by to Section 42 (1) and/or Section 51 will not arise since this Court has",""
"","already determined that the Appellant has failed to establish that the supply",""
"","of marine bunker fuel by the Appellant to the ships constitutes an export.",""
"","However, I wish to emphasise that this decision is limited to this case, and",""
"","in a case where the taxpayer establishes that marine bunker fuel has indeed",""

exported,  by  producing","the  necessary  documents  where","the"
"","destination of the ship is indicated, the Appellant may be entitled to claim",""

"","Furthermore, it is  my considered opinion that the export of bunker fuel,",""
