"The Respondent relied on the interpretation given to the word ‘export’ in"
"Section  22  of  the  Imports  and  Exports  (Control)  Act  No.  1  of  1969,  as"
"amended, and argued that ‘export’ shall mean the carrying and taking of"
"the goods out of Sri Lanka."
"The  Respondent  proposed  three  tests  in  deciding  whether  the  supply  of"
"marine bunker fuel is an export or not."
"The first test is ‘Taking out of Sri Lanka’"
"The  Appellant  argued  that  under  the  definitions  of  the  term  ‘export’  in"
"Section 22 of the Import and Export (Control) Act and Section 16 of the"
"Customs  Ordinance,  there  is  no  requirement  to  indicate  the  place  of"
"destination for a supply to be classified as an export."
"The Respondent cited the case of Perera and Silva Ltd v. Commissioner"
"General of Inland Revenue8 in support of their argument. The above is a"
"case where the Appellant, a manufacturer of wooden boxes, had sold those"
"to  others  who  used  those  boxes  to  pack  goods  and  export  them.  The"
"Appellant  claimed  that  his  business  came  under  the  expression  ‘articles"
"manufactured in Ceylon and exported’, and that his business was therefore"
"exempt from tax. However, the Supreme Court held that the turnover from"
"articles sold by the Appellant and exported by others is not exempted from"
"tax."
"Accordingly, the Respondent argued that in the instant case, the Appellant"
"sells bunker fuel to the master of the ship, a third party, who receives the"
"goods and takes them out of Sri Lanka."
"However, the interpretation of the word ‘export’ in the Import and Export"
"(Control)  Act,  relied  on by the  Respondent himself,  recognises  that  any"
"good caused to be carried or taken out of Sri Lanka by sea constitutes an"
"export.  Therefore,  it  appears  that  the  Appellant  causing  a  third  party  to"
"carry or take the goods out of Sri Lanka by sea is sufficient to constitute an"
"export. It may be the case that the above interpretation given in the Imports"
"and Exports (Control) Act was not considered in the case of Perera and"
"Silva Ltd v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue."
"Hence, the above argument of the Respondent has little merit."
"The second and third tests are that;"
