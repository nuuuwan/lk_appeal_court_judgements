"is  further  stated,  citing  Gajraj  Singh  v.  State  Transport  Appellate"
"Tribunal6:"
"“ (…) that legal fiction is one which is not an actual reality"
"but  which  the  law  recognizes  and  the  court  accepts  as  a"
"reality. Therefore, in case of legal fiction the court believes"
"something to exist which in reality does not exist. It is nothing"
"but  the  presumption  of  the  existence  of  the  state  of  affairs"
"which in actuality is non-existent. The effect of such a legal"
"fiction is that a position which otherwise would not obtain is"
"deemed to obtain under the circumstances.”"
