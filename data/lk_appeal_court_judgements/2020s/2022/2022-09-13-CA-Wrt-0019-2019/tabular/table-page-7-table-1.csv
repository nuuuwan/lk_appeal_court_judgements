"In Junaideen Mohamed Iqbal vs. The Divisional Secretary, Kundasale2"
"the  Court  of  Appeal 
simply  described 
the  principle  of 
legitimate"
"expectation as follows:"
"“…When  a  public  authority  represents  that 
it  will  or  will  not  do"
"something within its authority and later attempts to rescind the said"
"representation,  a  person  who  has  reasonably  relied  on  it  should  be"
"entitled to enforce it by law. This concept is based on the principles of"
"natural justice and fairness, and seeks to prevent the abuse of power"
"by public authorities…”"
"Wade discusses the principle of legitimate expectations3 as follows:"
"“…A 
further  and  more  satisfactory 
reason 
for 
the  protection  of"
"legitimate expectations lie in  the  trust  that has been reposed by  the"
"citizen in what he has been told or led to believe by the official. Good"
"government  depends  upon 
trust  between 
the  governed  and 
the"
"governor. Unless that trust is sustained and protected officials will not"
"be believed and the government becomes a choice between chaos and"
"coercion.” “…It is not enough that an expectation should exist: it must"
"in  addition  be  legitimate.  But  how  is  it  to  be  determined  whether  a"
"particular expectation is worthy of protection? This is a difficult area"
"since an expectation reasonably entertained by a person may not be"
"found to be legitimate because of some countervailing consideration of"
"policy or law. A crucial requirement is that the assurance must itself"
"be clear, unequivocal and unambiguous. Many  claimants fail at this"
"hurdle after  a close analysis of the assurance. The test is how on a"
"fair reading of the promise it would have been reasonably understood"
"by those to whom it was made….” (Page 452)."
