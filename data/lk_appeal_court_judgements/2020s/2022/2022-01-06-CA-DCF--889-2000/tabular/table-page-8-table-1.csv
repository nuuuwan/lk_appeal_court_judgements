"Since the Plaintiff instituted the instant action on 23.04.1985, it appears that the Defendant had"
"made the application to amend the paddy land register and included his name as the ande cultivator"
"in 1986, thus, apparently after the institution of the instant action."
"I
t is in evidence that the said William Singho, father of the Defendant and husband of the Plaintiff,"
"was the owner cultivator and the said William Singho cultivated the subject paddy land with the"
"members of the family."
"A
fter  the  demise  of  the  said  William  Singho,  the  Plaintiff  has  succeeded  to  the  rights  of  her"
"husband legally and continued cultivating the subject matter as the owner cultivator through her"
"children."
"O
n this premise, Court’s attention was drawn to Section 68 of the Act which defines “Cultivator”"
"with  reference  to  an  extent  of  paddy  land,  means  any  person,  other  than  an  Agrarian  Services"
"Committee, who by himself or by  any member of his  family, or jointly  with  any other person,"
"carries out on such extent;"
"(a) two or more of the operations of ploughing, sowing and reaping; and"
"(b) the operation of tending or watching the crop in each season during which paddy is cultivated"
"on such extent."
"T
hus,  it  is  apparent  that  no  qualification  imposed  in  Section  2  and  Section  68  of  the  said  Act,"
"interprets tenant cultivator."
"A
s  such,  the  Defendant  has  to  prove  the  requirements,  he  should  fulfil  in  order  to  be  a  tenant"
"cultivator."
"T
he  attention  of  Court  was  drawn  to  the  evidence  placed  before  the  learned  District  Judge.  It"
"appears that the Plaintiff said in evidence that,"
"ප්‍ර   ස්ටින්    ේ  ුඹුරේ  ක්කරය් වැඩ කර් න කියලා තම්  කිව්වද?"
"උ   ඔව් මම ඒ කාේේ කිව්වා."
"ප්‍ර   වි්තිකකුට  කිව්ේව් කක ක්කරය් වැඩ කරේනන කික් ඒවා කික් කය  ේද් න කියලද?."
