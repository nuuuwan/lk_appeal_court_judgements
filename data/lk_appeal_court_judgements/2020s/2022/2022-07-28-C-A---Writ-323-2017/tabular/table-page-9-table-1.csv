"have not yet acquired the lands owned by the Petitioners under clause 4.3 of"
"the Circular marked 1R1. The Respondents have not taken any steps under the"
"State Lands Ordinance or under the provisions of the National Environment Act"
"to create and establish the intended reservation. That is the grievance of the"
"Petitioners. They are seeking to set aside the aforesaid decision mainly on that"
"ground.  But 
if  the  Respondents  take  meaningful  steps  to 
implement  the"
"aforesaid  decision  according  to law  and  follow  the  proper  legal  procedure  to"
"create the intended reservation then the Petitioners cannot complain against"
"that decision. The learned counsel for the Petitioners submitted that if the land"
"is  acquired  for  a  reservation 
in  the 
legal  manner  the  Petitioners  have  no"
"objections to that. But the Respondents are not taking steps to acquire the land"
"to  avoid 
the  payment  of  compensation.  As  a  matter  of  policy 
several"
"government departments and institutions can get together and take a common"
"decision  to  face  pressing  environmental  problems.  Therefore,  there 
is  no"
"necessity to issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari to quash the"
"decision to create a reservation 50m in width. A mandate in the nature of a writ"
"of prohibition preventing the Respondents from acting on the assumption that"
"there is a reservation in existence would suffice to safeguard the interests of the"
"Petitioners."
"The learned Senior State Counsel for the 1st to 8th and 10th to 12th Respondents"
"has  drawn  our  attention 
to 
the 
judgement  of 
Jayaweera  Vs  Assistant"
"Commissioner of Agrarian Services Rathnapura 1996 (2) SLR 70.  In that case"
"F.N.D. Jayasuriya – J had held as follows;"
"“A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for  the issue of a Writ of"
"Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as"
"a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a discretion"
"to deny him relief having regard to his conduct; delay, laches, waiver, submission"
"to  jurisdiction  –  are  all  valid  impediments  which  stand  against  the  grant  of"
"relief.”"
"The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that if a 50m limit is not there then"
"there will be a disaster. He emphasized that there is a genuine environmental"
"necessity to implement a 50m lake reservation. To substantiate this position the"
"learned  Senior  State  Counsel  has  drawn  our  attention  to  the  contents  of  an"
"affidavit given by one Mr. Jayadheera – the Director of Irrigation Colombo. The"
"Petitioners have objected to this document on the basis that it had been filed"
"two  years  after  the  incident  and  the  affirmant  is  a  respondent  in  this  case."
