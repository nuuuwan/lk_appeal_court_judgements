"from orders and judgments of a District Court shall, mutatis mutandis, apply"
"to and in relation to appeals from orders of the Tribunal….”"
"In  these  circumstances,  it  is  the  view  of  this  Court  that  in  terms  of  the"
"provisions of the Wakfs Act, the Wakfs Tribunal is vested with the exclusive"
"jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute in relation to the property in"
"suit."
"Thus, I see no basis to grant leave to appeal against the impugned Order of"
"the  Wakf  Tribunal,  and  accordingly,  leave  is  refused  and  the  Petition  is"
"dismissed with costs fixed  at Rs. 75,000/- payable by the Petitioner to the"
"Respondents."
"Leave refused."
