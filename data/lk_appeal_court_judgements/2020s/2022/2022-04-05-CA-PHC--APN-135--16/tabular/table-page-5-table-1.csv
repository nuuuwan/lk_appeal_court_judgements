"petitioner to the satisfaction of Court, and it has been held so in the case of"
"CA/PHC/APN78/2021 by this bench and in many other cases."
"In the instant matter the delay has not been explained in the petition but the"
"Counsel appearing for the petitioner has stated that the delay was due to the"
"obtaining of proceedings from the High Court. But this Court notes that this is"
"not substantiated by an affidavit along with the petition."
"Therefore this Court observes with disapproval that the petitioner had violated"
"the Court of Appeal rules and furthermore the petitioner has not explained the"
"delay in filling the petition in an acceptable manner."
"As such the preliminary objection of the respondent is upheld and the instant"
"matter for revision is dismissed in limine."
