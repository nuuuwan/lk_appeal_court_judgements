"The three appellants have left the Sri Lankan shores in a small dingy boat, and"
"when  detected,  were  near  the  India-Sri  Lanka  maritime  boundary.  This  is  an"
"area where Sri Lankan fishermen do not normally fish during that time of the"
"day. The Navy craft which observed the suspicious movements of the boat had"
"been  keeping  the  boat  under  surveillance  for  some  time  before  they  observed"
"the  approaching  Indian  vessel  towards  the  dingy  boat.  The  Navy  officers  have"
"seen a parcel being handed over to the occupants of the dingy boat. When the"
"Navy  officers  reached  the  boat  and  stopped  it,  the  parcel  was  near  the  1st"
"appellant and it was he, who has opened one of the packets and thrown it into"
"the sea. That does not mean that it was he who had the sole possession of the"
"parcel, making him liable to be prosecuted and not the other occupants of the"
"boat. The proven facts provide ample evidence to show that it was an act done"
"by  the  appellants  in  connivance.  If  not  for  the  help  of  each  other,  it  is  not"
"possible  to  travel  so  far  into  the  sea  in  a  small  craft  like  a  dingy.  There  is"
"nothing  to  conclude  that  the  appellants  were  not  privy  to  each  other 
in"
"committing  the  crime.  It  is  obvious  that  one  has  to  hold  on  to  the  cargo  they"
"received  from  the  Indian  vessel  to  make  sure  that  it  is  not  lost  at  sea  in  an"
"unstable small boat. I find that it was the reason why the parcel was near the"
"1st appellant when the Navy approached the boat and for no other reason. It is"
"my  considered  view  that  the  prosecution  has  proven  the 
joint  possession"
"beyond reasonable doubt in this case."
"The  1st  and  the  3rd  appellants  in  their  evidence  and  the  2nd  appellant  in  his"
"statement  from  the  dock,  has  taken  up  the  position  that  they  were  assaulted"
"after their arrest and three other small Navy crafts also came thereafter, and a"
"parcel  brought  in  one  of  the  other  Navy  crafts  was  introduced  to  them.  In"
"addition, it has been claimed that one parcel was opened by the Navy officers"
"and the powder that was there was applied on their bodies by the Navy officers."
"However, 
I 
find 
that 
the  appellants  have 
failed 
to  confront 
the  relevant"
"witnesses  when  they  had  the  opportunity  of  cross-examining  the  witnesses  in"
