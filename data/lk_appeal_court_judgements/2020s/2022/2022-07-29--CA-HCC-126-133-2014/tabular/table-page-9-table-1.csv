"It was also his submission that in the event of the grounds of appeal being not"
"considered in favour of the appellants, the Court may consider the  revision of"
"the death penalty imposed on the appellants in view of the fact that the Indian"
"nationals  who  were  found  guilty  along  with  the  appellants  are  now  free  men"
"due to the commuting of their sentences and been deported."
"It  was  the  submission  of  the  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  (ASG)  on"
"behalf of the respondent that he will not stand in the way if the Court decides"
"to reconsider the sentence imposed on the appellants given the fact that some"
"of  the  accused  of  the  action  who  were  found  guilty  along  with  the  appellants"
"are now free, only due to the fact of they being Indian nationals."
"However, it was his contention that the grounds of appeal advanced on behalf"
"of the appellants have no merit. He points out that the map marked P-01 has"
"been  clearly  established  by  the  evidence,  and  the  joint  possession  as  well.  He"
"also  brings  to  the  notice  of  the  Court  that  the  defence  put  forward  by  the"
"appellants when they were called for a defence has not been put to the relevant"
"witnesses when they gave evidence in Court, which makes such defence of no"
"value."
