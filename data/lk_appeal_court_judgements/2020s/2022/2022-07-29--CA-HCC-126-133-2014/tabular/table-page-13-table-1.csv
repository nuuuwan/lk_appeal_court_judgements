"and trafficking of more than two grams of Heroin is either the death sentence"
"or  a  sentence  of  life  in  prison.  I  find  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  was"
"justified in imposing the death sentence given the facts and the circumstances"
"of  the  matter  and  having  considered  the  pure  quantity  of  Heroin  detected  in"
"this instance."
"However,  as  contended  and  agreed  by  the  learned  ASG,  the  death  sentence"
"imposed  on  the  4th  to  8th  accused  of  the  case  has  been  commuted  to  life  in"
"prison and subsequently to a term of 20 years by the President in terms of his"
"powers  as  stated  before.  This  has  happened  within  a  short  span  of  their"
"withdrawal  of  the  appeals  and  they  have  been  deported  as  well.  The  only"
"conclusion  that  can  be  reached  is  that  this  has  happened  because  they  are"
"Indian nationals."
"As such, it is my considered view that given the special circumstances as they"
"stand  now,  the  imposition  of  the  death  sentence  on  the  appellants  can  no"
"longer  be  justified.  Therefore,  I  set  aside  the  death  sentence  imposed  on  the"
"appellants  on  each  of  the  three  counts  for  which  they  were  found  guilty,  and"
"substitute sentences of life imprisonment on the appellants."
"Subjected to the above variance to the sentence, the appeal is dismissed as it is"
"devoid of merit."
