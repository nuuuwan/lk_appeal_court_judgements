"In Perera Vs Munaweera 56 NLR 433 the Supreme Court held that "" it was not open to convict"
"the appellant unless it rejected the appellant's evidence that he believed in good faith, and"
"by reason of a mistake of fact, that he was justified in law in charging 26 cents for a loaf of"
"bread which he honestly but erroneously believed to be 16 ounces in weight""."
"Creating a forged document such as 'P 3' occurs if the accused-appellant makes reference to"
"a  forged  document.  Yet,  with  reference  to  contents  other  than  invalid  life  interest  in  the"
"'P1(A)', neither 4th accused person who had the sole rights over P1(A)' nor the PW 1 disputed"
"over genuineness or the validity of the said 'P1(A)' had a valid agreement. Learned counsel"
"for the accused-appellant argued that the 1st accused-appellant had a mistaken identification"
"of the PW 1 in regard to legal entitlement and status of PW 1 when PW 3 could not secure"
"such entitlement and status within the parameters of vendor-vendee relationship between"
"PW 3 and 4th accused person. In criminal law, a mistake of fact usually operates as a defence"
"so long as it is reasonable in good faith under section 72 of the Penal Code,"
"When  no  valid  and  effective  life  interest  for  another  person,  nor  a  third  party  could  be"
"reserved such by the vendor in a deed of transfer because it impedes transfusing totality of"

"estate was made in a paragraph inserted between the granting and habendum clause, such"
"reservation was repugnant to the granting clause."
"Prosecution led evidence of PW 5. PC 21377 Jinadasa (PW 5) in his cross-examination stated"
"that he received the first complaint on 20.11.1995. Deed No. 2025 marked as 'P1(A)' and Deed"
"No. 2026 marked as 'P 3' had been attested on 01.12.1993. It is important to note that the"
"first complaint was made after two years from the date of attestation. Prosecution has not"
"given any explanation by way of evidence as to why there was a delay of complaining the"
"demeanour  on  the  part  of  the  first  accused-appellant  until  PW  1  made  the  complaint  on"

"PW 1 was residing with his wife Winifrida Thamel: 4th accused person. At this time his wife"
"urged to sell a portion of the land to Attorney-at-Law Shantha Niriallea who was a tenant at"
"this time at the same premises. Susila Kanthi Sepali (PW 2) who witnessed to Deed No. 2025"
"'P1(A)'  said  there  had  been  a  dispute  with  tenants,  it  triggered  PW1  to  make  the  first"

"have known that his wife wanted to have a bank loan so that, he admitted his life interest in"
"'P1A' was revoked."
"Therefore, PW 1 had direct or tacit understanding of revocation on the date signing the `P 3',"
"although he said there had been a cheating, this situation raises a reasonable doubt whether"
"the  accused  appellant  committed  an  offence  alleged.  PW  1  himself,  around  the  date  of"
"complaining, witnessed that lawyer Niriella paid Rs 120,000 to the wife Thamel: 4th accused"
"person  around  1995.  This  reflects  a  plot  that  PW1  complained  to  the  police  inasmuch  as"
"Niriella Attorney at law who was interested in buying the land in which PW 1 was placed in"
"the dominion over property belonged to his former wife Thamel. Thus, first accused-appellant"
