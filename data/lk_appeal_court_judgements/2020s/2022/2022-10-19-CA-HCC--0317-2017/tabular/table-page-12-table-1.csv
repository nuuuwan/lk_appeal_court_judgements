"“The Judgement of this case was prepared and delivered by the last Trial Judge who"
"had  no  opportunity  to  observe  demeanour  and  deportment  of  the  prosecution"
"witnesses.  This  fact  alone  made  this  judgment  a  handicapped.  Thus,  learned  Trial"
"Judge failed to consider contradictions and vital discrepancies between evidence of"
"PW 1, PW 2 and PW 3.”"
