"VII. 
Prosecution’s failure to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt has"
"not been considered in a Judicial perspective by the Learned Trial"
"Judge."
"PW1 was an 11-year-old boy at the time of the incident. He had stayed at"
"home  with  the  deceased  on  the  day  of  the  incident  as  he  was  not  well"
"enough 
to  go 
to  school. 
In  giving  evidence,  PW1  had  narrated 
the"
"incident  to  the  court. 
  He  described  the  way  the  appellant  poured"
"kerosene oil over his mother and the way how he had set her on fire and"
"how  the  appellant  fled  the  place.  PW1  further  stated  that  he  rushed  to"
"PW3  exclaiming  as  to  what  had  happened.  PW3  had  then  run  to  the"
"scene  and  extinguished  the  fire  and  had  taken  the  deceased  to  the"
"hospital."
"It  was  submitted  for  the  appellant  that  the  testimony  of  a  solitary  eye"
"witness  was  not  corroborated  in  material  particulars  by  the  evidence  of"
"independent  sources.  Further,    it  was  argued  that  the  evidence  of  PW1"
"was  contradicted  by 
the  medical  evidence  and 
the  police  evidence."
"However, this argument was not factually correct. The doctor was of the"
"opinion that the kerosene oil was poured on the deceased person’s body."
"Whereas, PW1’s evidence reveals that the appellant had poured kerosene"
"oil from the back of his mother and the oil spilled all over her body. I do"
"not see any significant difference here. The point argued by the appellant"
"is  whether  the  kerosene  oil  was  poured  on  the  head  of  the  deceased  or"
"the body of the deceased. It was proved  by the evidence that  eighty-one"
"percent of the body of the deceased was burnt. It was quite clear that the"
"evidence  of  PW1  is  that  “ඇගස ේරම  ගලා  ගියා”,  was  correct.  All  these"
"actions  had  been  taken  place  in  a  pretty  unexpected  manner  and  in  a"
"rapid  succession.  There  is  no  considerable  contradiction  concerning  the"
"evidence of PW1 and the evidence of PW1 is corroborated by the evidence"
"of the doctor."
