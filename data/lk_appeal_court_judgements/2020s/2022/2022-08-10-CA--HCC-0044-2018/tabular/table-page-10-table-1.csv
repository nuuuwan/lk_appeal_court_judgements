"the evidence placed before the Court with a clear understanding of the relevant"
"legal principles and had come to a correct finding of guilt of the appellant on the"

"For the reasons aforementioned, I find no merit in the ground of appeal urged."
"The appeal therefore is dismissed as it is devoid of any merit. The conviction and"
"the sentence affirmed."
