"submissions. Accordingly, he formulated the following new ground of appeal for"
"the consideration of the Court."
"1.  Whether there was  evidence before the  learned High Court  Judge for"
"him to convict the appellant in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code"
"on the basis of culpable homicide not amounting to murder rather than"
"in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code under which he was convicted."
"It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant that there was"
"evidence  before  the  Court  to  consider  the  matter  in  terms  of  section  294"
"exception 1 of the Penal Code on the basis of grave and sudden provocation. It"
"was his view that the term ‘sudden provocation’ includes cumulative provocation"
"and the evidence led in this case directs towards cumulative provocation towards"
"the appellant under which this incident has occurred."
"Citing several decided cases of our Superior Courts on the concept of cumulative"
"provocation,  and  also  on  the  basis  that  a  trial  judge  should  consider  whether"
"there  was  evidence  of  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to  murder  even  if  no"
"such defence has been taken at the trial, it was the view of the learned Counsel"
"that this is a fit and proper case where the conviction should have been in terms"
"of section 297 of the Penal Code."
"It  was  the  view  of  the  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  (ASG)  that  he  is  in"
"agreement with the argument that the term ‘sudden provocation’ mentioned in"
"section 294 exception 1 of the Penal Code includes cumulative provocation as"
"decided by our Superior Courts."
"However, it was contended that for a trial judge to come to such a finding, there"
"must be evidence before the trial Court. It was his view that the appellant who"
"has never taken up such a defence at the trial has no basis to argue that his act"
"amounts  to  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to  murder  as  there  was  no"
"evidence before the trial Court to come to such a conclusion. It was the view of"
"the learned ASG that although section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance provides"
"that the burden of proving that the case of the accused comes within exceptions"
