"In the case of Chaminda Vs. The Republic (2009) 1 SLR 144, it was held:"
"“An appellate Court will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial judge who"
"has come to a favourable finding with regard to the testimonial"
"trustworthiness of a witness whose demeanor and deportment had been"
"observed by a trial judge. Findings of primary facts by a trial judge who"
"hears and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on appeal.”"
