"W
hat  Section  195(ee)  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  states  is"
"that  “if  the  indictment  relates  to  an  offence  triable  by  a  jury,  inquire"
"from  the  accused  whether  or  not  he  elects  to  be  tried  by  a  jury.”  On"
"18.06.2015,  jury  option  was  given  to  the  accused-appellant  and  the"
"learned High Court Judge recorded that “ජුරි සභාවක් රහිත නඩු විභාගයක්"
"විත්ති පාර්ශවය විසින් තතෝරාගනී.” Therefore, it is apparent that the jury"
"option had been given to the accused-appellant and he opted to have"
"the trial without a jury. Hence, I hold that the requirement of Section"
"195(ee) of the CCPA has been complied with."
