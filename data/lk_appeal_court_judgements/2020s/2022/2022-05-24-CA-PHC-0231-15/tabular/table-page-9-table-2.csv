"Procedure, 1973 19th Edition, Delhi Law House, Page 968).  Sohoni commenting"
"on Section 133 of the Indian code observed the following:"
"“the magistrate, while dealing with an application under Section 133"
"Cr.  P.  C  would  first  issue  a  conditional  order  in  Form  No  20  of  the"
"code  calling  upon  the  respondent  to  remove  the  nuisance.  If  the"
"respondent objects to do so on his appearance, he should be asked"
"to  show  cause  for  the  order  being  made  absolute.  Thereafter,  the"
"Magistrate has to take evidence in the matter as in a summons case,"
"and  only  thereafter  the  Magistrate  if  he  is  satisfied,  will  make  the"
"order absolute."
"There is no statutory provision in India justifying a private person or"
"member  of  the  public  in  demolishing  a  building  etc.,  by  way  of"
"abating a nuisance. The scheme of Section 133 to 141 indicates that"
"in the case of such a public nuisance, anybody aggrieved by it should"
"not take the law into his own hand but must resort to the particular"
"procedure  laid  down  therein.  Section  133  of  the  Code  provides  a"
"speedy  and  summary  remedy  in  case  of  urgency  where  danger  to"
"public  interest  or  public  health  is  concerned.  In  all  other  cases  the"
"party  should  be  referred  to  the  remedy  under  the  ordinary  law  or"
"annoyance  must  be  caused.  Any  person  naturally  can  give  a"
"Magistrate  information  of  the  existence  of  any  state  of  affairs,  and"
"when the Magistrate acts on that information he is acting suo motu.”"
