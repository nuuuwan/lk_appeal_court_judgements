"When examining Section 98(2) of the CPC, it provides for the following:"
"“Any person against whom a conditional order has been made under"
"subsection (1) may appear before the Magistrate making that order"
"or any other Magistrate of that court before the expiration of the time"
"fixed by that order and move to have the order set aside or modified"
"in manner hereinafter provided”"
"As  such,  it  is  clear  that  after  an  ex  parte  conditional  order  is  issued  by  the"
"Magistrate  under  Section  98(1)  of  the  CPC,  the  person  to  whom  the  order  is"
"addressed it given an opportunity to ‘show cause’ (Section 100 of the CPC). If the"
"person appears and moves the conditional order to be set aside or modified, the"
"legislature  provides  that  the  Magistrate  shall  take  evidence  in  the  said  matter"
"and, depending on his satisfaction, either rescind or modify the impugned order"
"or make the order absolute (Section 101 of the CPC). Under Section 101 of the"
"CPC  the  Magistrate  is  allowed  to  either  make  the  previous  conditional  order"
"absolute or rescind or amended the previous conditional order. In the latter case,"

"reasonable and proper, the Magistrate will not make the same absolute. (Section"
"101 of the CP). As held in Kularatne v Dharnadasa (2001) ACJ 28 CA, when a"
"Magistrate makes a conditional order in terms of Section 98, it is the party who"
"moves to have the conditional order set aside or modified that has to begin and"

"burden of establishing a public nuisance lies on the complainant. Speaking on"
"Section 101(1) of the CPC,  Greena  Fernando  v  Teckla  Saparamadu  (1990) 1"
"SLR 270 held that “Section 101(1) lays down the procedure to be followed when"
"such party  appears in Court  and moves  to have  the order set  aside or modified."
"This section makes it mandatory for the Magistrate to take evidence in the matter."
"A  judicial  investigation  must  be  held  and  after  it,  if  the  court  thinks  that  the"
