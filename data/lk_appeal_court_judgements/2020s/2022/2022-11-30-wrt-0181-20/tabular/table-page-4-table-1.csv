"Divisional Secretary  for such land under the Land Development Ordinance in the year"
"2011. At this point, a question that arises is if the lands were under the purview of the"
"Forests Department, how could the Divisional Secretary have issued permits, especially"
"since  the  Divisional  Secretary  must  first  ascertain  the  situation  of  the  land  prior  to"
"making the selection of who is entitled to it at the Kachcheri. Even if such Kachcheri is"
"not undertaken, Section 20(a) of the Land Development Ordinance provides that the Land"
"Commissioner can immediately alienate the land if it is desirable in the interests of the"
"applicant “and that there are no other interests in the land in question which are likely"
"to be prejudiced”. The interests of the Forest Department would indeed be prejudiced by"
"an alienation of the land which is alleged to be under the control of the Forest Department."
"In addition, it is contended, that the Petitioner does not have locus standi to file"
"this application as the Quit Notice was served on her husband."
"At the outset, it must be stated that we do not see any merit in the locus standi"
"argument. The Petitioner’s husband occupies the land in the capacity of a dependent of"
"the permit holder. If the permit holder is permitted to occupy the land, the purpose that"
"would be served if the spouse of the permit holder is asked to vacate the land is perplexing."
"The logic in serving a Quit Notice on the spouse of a permit holder, puzzling as it is, has"
"the effect of rendering the permit nugatory. It is also a disruption of the family life of a"
"lawful occupant. It need not be reminded that the State shall recognize and protect the"
"family as the basic unit of society in terms of the Directive Principles of State Policy (vide"
"Article 27(12) of the Constitution)."
"The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, as amended provides"
"for an expeditious method of recovery of “state lands” without the State being forced to go"
"through a very cumbersome process of a protracted civil action and consequent appeals"
"(Vide L.H.M.B.B. Herath v. Morgan Engineering [2013] 1 SLR 222). According to Section"
"3(1) of the Act, where a competent authority forms an opinion that any land is State land"
"and that a person is in unauthorised possession or occupation of that land, the competent"
"authority may serve a notice (referred to as a “Quit Notice”) on such person requiring such"
"person  to  vacate  that  land  and  to  deliver  vacant  possession  of  that  land.  This  Section"
"reads:"
