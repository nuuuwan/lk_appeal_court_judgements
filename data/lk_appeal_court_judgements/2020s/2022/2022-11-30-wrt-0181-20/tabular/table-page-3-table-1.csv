. Sasi Mahendran, J."
"The Petitioner, by Petition dated 21st July 2020, applied to this Court in terms of"
"Article 140 of the Constitution seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st"
"Respondent (The Conservator General of Forests acting as the “competent authority”) to"
"issue the Quit Notice (“P3a”) under Section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)"
"Act No. 7 of 1979, as amended; a Writ of Prohibition preventing any one or more of the"
"Respondents from proceeding with the said Quit Notice; an award of compensation."
"The crux of the Petitioner’s grievance is that the competent authority’s decision to"

"situated  in  the  Pallekadu  forest,  was  under  the  control  of  the  Divisional  Secretary  of"
"Ampara,  and  in  2007  the  control  of  the  land  had  been  handed  over  to  the  Forest"
"Department. Nonetheless, the Respondents have failed to submit any material, including"
"the  Gazette  under  which  such  lands  were  handed  over  to  the  Forests  Department,  to"
"substantiate  this  point.  This  is  important  to  stress  because  it  was  only  after  such"
"purported handing over, that permits had been issued to the Petitioner and many others"
"(sixty-eight others, as per the Petitioner’s Fundamental Rights Application “P2a”) by the"
