"The other ground raised by the accused-appellant was that the learned High Court Judge, by"
"giving undue importance to the prosecution case, misdirected him by stating that evidence"
"given by the accused-appellant did not create any doubt in the prosecution case and it is a"
"clear misdirection on the burden of proof in a criminal case. I do not agree with the above"
"argument.  The  learned  trial  Judge  of  the  High  Court  had  given  due  consideration  to  the"
"defence case. When considering pages 88 to 94 of the  judgment (pages 769 to 774 of the"
"appeal brief) it  is  very  clear  that  the  learned  Judge  of  the  High  Court  in his  judgment  had"
"considered and evaluated the evidence adduced by the defence."
"Learned counsel for the accused-appellant argued that the learned High Court Judge failed"
"to observe that an adverse inference of guilt cannot be drawn on the basis that bloodstains"
"found on the firearm, number 0305323 originated from the accused-appellant, as it is only a"
"suspicious  circumstance  and  that 
is  not  sufficient  to  establish  guilt  or  to  release  the"
"prosecution  of 
its  burden  of  proving  the  case  against  the  accused-appellant  beyond  a"
"reasonable  doubt. 
It 
is  my  view 
that 
the  prosecution  had  proved 
the  case  beyond"
"reasonable doubt by submitting both direct and circumstantial evidence. Therefore, bringing"
"up  a  single  untested  fact  as  a  ground  of  appeal  could  be  considered  an  unsuccessful"
"attempt."
"It was further argued by the learned counsel for the accused-appellant that the learned High"
"Court  Judge,  failed to  observe  that  bloodstains found  on  the  firearm  and  clothes  worn  by"
"the accused-appellant, was not linked to the bloodstains of the deceased. This was an item"
"of evidence favourable to the accused-appellant."
"There 
is  no  doubt 
considering  both  direct  and 
circumstantial  evidence  which  had"
"demonstrated that the appellant was the person who shot at the deceased. While he was"
"running  the  appellant  had  been  injured.  The  bloodstains  found  from  the  clothes  and  the"
"weapon  used  by  the  appellant  are  similar  to  the  appellant.  Thus,  there  could  not  have  a"
"chance to smear the deceased's blood in the appellant's clothes and on his weapon."
"It  is  important  to  note  that  the  learned  Judge  of  the  High  Court  had  considered  both  the"
"prosecution 
case 
and 
the  defence 
case.  He  had 
considered  both 
the  direct  and"
"circumstantial evidence when delivering the judgment. The learned counsel for the accused-"
"appellant further argued that he had been deprived of a fair trial."
"The right of an accused person to a fair trial is recognized in all the criminal justice systems"
"in the civilized world. Its denial is generally proof enough that justice is denied. The right to"
"a  fair  trial  was  formally  recognised 
in 
international 
law 
in  1948 
in  the  United  Nations"
"Declaration of Human Rights. Since 1948 the right to a fair trial has been incorporated into"
"many  national,  regional  and  international  instruments.  Like  the  concept  of  fairness,  a  fair"
"trial is also not capable of a clear definition, but there are certain aspects or qualities of a"
"fair trial that could be easily identified."
"In  the  case  of  The  Attorney-General  vs  Segulebbe  Latheef  and  Another  2008  (1)  SLR  225,"
"some of the important aspects of a fair trial was discussed and it was held that the right to a"
"fair trial amongst other things includes the following;"
