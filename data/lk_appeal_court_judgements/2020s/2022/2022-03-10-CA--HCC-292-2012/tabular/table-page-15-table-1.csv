"The psychology of the witness, the environment, the situation at the time of the incident,"
"should  be  taken 
into  consideration 
in  evaluating  the  evidence.  Due  to 
the  situation"
"prevailing  at  the  time  of  the  incident  and  the  threats  made  to  the  witness  due  to  the"
"incident  and  the  fear  he  had  created  regarding  this 
incident,  the  police  can  record  a"
"statement at any time."
"The  testimony  of  a  witness  in  prosecution  should  not  be  dismissed  by  the  court  on  the"
"ground of any deficiency or contradiction. The court must distinguish the truth from false; in"
"that  test  and  evaluate  evidence.  Accordingly,  those  matters  should  be  brought  to  the"
"attention of the court when the court evaluates the evidence."
"Thus,  the  court  has  the  power  to  distinguish  the  truth  from  false  in  any  evidence  and  to"
"reach  the  correct  conclusion.  The  Court,  after  considering  the  contradictions  held  in  this"
"case,  concludes  that  there  is  no  damage  to  the  core  of  the  case.  Based  on  the  witness’s"
"mental  state  and  fear,  and  other  facts  surrounding  the  incident,  the  court  concluded  that"
"the  witness’s  testimony  was  not  harmed  by  the  contradictions  marked  by  the  accused-"
"appellant  regarding  the  non  -  disclosure  of  the  shooter  in  the  statement  made  by  the"
"witness to the police when he gave the 1st statement immediately after the crime."
"When  I  consider  the  evidence  lead  before  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  it  is  crystal  clear"
"that the accused-appellant brutally murdered Thangaraja Maheshwaran and Chandrakumar"
"Mahindan with the intention of killing."
"I
n light of the reasons aforesaid, having regard to the facts and the legal principles involved"
"in  the  present  matter 
in  question,  this  appeal  has  failed  to  hold  any  merit.  Thus,  the"
"conviction and the sentence should stand and therefore is affirmed."
"The judgement of the learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 27.08.2012 is affirmed."
"There  is no  reason to  interfere  with the  findings  of  the  learned  trial Judge.  We  affirm  the"
"conviction and the sentence dated 27.08.2012."
"Appeal dismissed."
"Registrar is directed to send a copy of this Judgment along with the main case record to the"
"High Court of Colombo and as to the prison authorities forthwith."
