"could  not  answer 
the  charge  as  no  specific  dates"
"relating  to  the  offence  were  mentioned  in  the  charge."
"However, when he gave evidence, he has not put forth"
"any defence of alibi stating that at any time during the"
"period specified in the charge, he was elsewhere. I bear"
"in  mind  that  the  appellant  has  no  burden  to  prove  a"
"defence of alibi. It is the prosecution that has to prove"
"that 
the  accused  committed 
the  crime.  As 
rightly"
"considered  and  concluded  by  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge,  the  prosecution  has  proved  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt  that  the  offences  of  sexual  abuse  on  the  victim"
"were  committed  by  the  appellant  during  the  period"
"specified 
in 
the  charges  no.1  and  no.2.  When 
the"
"defence  of  the  appellant  does  not  rely  on  an  alibi,  I"
"hold 
that  no  prejudice  has  been 
caused 
to 
the"
"appellant by mentioning in the charge, a period during"
"which  the  appellant  sexually  abused  the  PW1.  The"
"victim  has  been  consistent  when  he  gave  the  short"
"history to the medical officer (PW9) who examined him"
"and  mentioned  the  period  in  which  he  was  abused."
"Hence  the  grounds  of  appeal  no.1  and  no.2  have  no"
"merit."
