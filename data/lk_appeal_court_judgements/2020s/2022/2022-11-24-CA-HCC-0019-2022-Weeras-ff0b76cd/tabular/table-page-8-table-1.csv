"appellant.  In  a  case  such  as  this,  it  is  important  to"
"consider  the  circumstances  under  which  these  acts  of"
"sexual abuse were committed against the victim by the"
"appellant. 
The 
PW1 
had 
been 
living 
with 
his"
"grandparents.  The  PW1  and  the  grandparents  have"
"used  the  well  that  belonged  to  the  appellant  to  fetch"
"water. The victim has also been going to the appellantâ€™s"
"house to watch television and has even been using his"
"bicycle.  The  appellant  has  sexually  abused  the  PW1,"
"clearly 
taking  advantage  of  the  vulnerability  of  the"
"victim.  By  virtue  of  being  a  child,  when 
they  are"
"sexually  abused, 
they  may 
tend 
to  hide 
this 
from"
"others, they may even feel guilty among themselves for"
"what had transpired. The PW1 has only divulged about"
"these 
abuses  when 
he  was 
questioned 
by 
the"
"authorities. 
Therefore, 
not  making 
the 
complaint"
"immediately  after 
the 
incident  will  not  affect 
the"
"credibility  of  the  child.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge"
"in her judgment has sufficiently discussed the issue of"
"delay  in  making  the  complaint  by  the  victim  at  pages"
"11  and 12 of  her judgment  (pages  161  and 162 of  the"
"appeal  brief)  and  has  rightly  concluded  that  the  delay"
"in  making 
the 
complaint 
has 
not 
affected 
the"
"credibility of the child victim. Therefore, the grounds of"
"appeal 3, 4 and 5 should necessarily fail."
