"c
ommercial purposes. The police has not found any money in possession of the"
"appellant  before  going  to  Asthambiâ€™s  house.  No  evidence  adduced  to  say  that"
"the  amount  of  heroin  involved  in  this  case  is  excessive  than  the  amount  that"
"can usually be found in possession of  an ordinary drug addict.  Therefore, the"
"court  has  no  ground  to  say  that  the  appellant  was  keeping  the  heroin  for"
"trafficking.  Therefore, I am of the view that the prosecution has failed to prove"
"the  second  count  in  the  indictment  and  therefore,  the  appellant  should  be"
"acquitted from the same."
"The  next  argument  is  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  prove  exclusive"
"possession  regarding  the  money  and  the  heroin  found  in  the  house  of"
"Asthambi."
"When  the  police  went  to  the  house  of  Asthambi,  the  doors  were  opened  and"
"there was nobody inside at that time.  However, it is apparent that though the"
"house belonged to Asthambi, some other people had also lived there.  Besides,"
"the police failed to record a statement from Asthambi regarding the parcel and"
"the money found in his house.  The heroin and money was not in possession of"
"the  appellant  at  that  time.    The  only  fact  proved  by  the  evidence  is  that  the"
"appellant knew the place where the heroin and money was located.  The parcel"
"was  not  in  his  sole  custody.    In  such  a  scenario,  to  prove  the  liability  of  the"
"accused,  the  prosecution  must 
lead  additional  evidence  to  show  that  the"
"appellant had the ability to control the said dangerous drugs and that he had"
"the intention to exercise control over them.  The prosecution has failed to prove"
"that the appellant had the power and intention to control the place where the"
"second parcel was found.  Therefore,  I hold that the third and fourth charges"
"have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt."
"I now consider the first and second grounds of appeal together, that is the"
"evidence  of  PW1 
is  not  credible  enough 
to  prove  the  case  beyond"
"reasonable  doubt  and  the 
learned  Trial  Judge  has  failed  to  give  due"
"consideration to the improbabilities of the evidence of PW1."
