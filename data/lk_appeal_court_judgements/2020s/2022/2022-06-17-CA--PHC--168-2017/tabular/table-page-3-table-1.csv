"I
t is observable that the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction"
"of the Provincial High Court of Embilipitiya in terms of Article 154P (3) (b), and not under Article"
"154P (4) of the Constitution."
"T
herefore,  it  appears  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  misconstrued  the  Articles  of  the"
"Constitution and also relied on the Judgment of ‘Solaimuthu Rasu’ expressing his view that any"
"matter relating to State lands could not be reviewed in any manner in the Provincial High Court."
"As such, it is apparent that the Order made by the learned High Court Judge dismissing the revision"
"application made by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant  is  made  per  incuriam. Therefore, the"
"impugned Order dated 31.08.2017 made by the learned High Court Judge is set aside."
"W
e  take  notice  of  the  motion  dated  07.06.2022  filed  on  behalf  of  the  Applicant-Respondent-"
"Respondent, stating its consent to have this matter sent back to the High Court of Embilipitiya for"
"it  to  be  considered  on  its  merits.  In  view  of  the  aforementioned  reasons,  we  set  aside  dated"
"31.08.2017 and send this case back to the Provincial High Court of Embilipitiya to re-hear and"
"determine this matter on its merits."
"T
hus, the appeal is allowed and Registrar is directed to send the case record back to the High Court"
"of Embilipitiya forthwith."
