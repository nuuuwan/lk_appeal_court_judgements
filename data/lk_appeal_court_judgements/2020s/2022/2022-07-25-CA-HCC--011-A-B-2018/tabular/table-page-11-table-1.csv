"In  The  Attorney  General  v.  Devunderage  Nihal  SC/Appeal  154/2010"
"dated 03.01.2019 the court held that:"
"“This  court  is  mindful  of  the  fact  that  the  witnesses  testify  before  the"
"trial  judge  and  it  is  the  trial  judge  who  would  have  the  benefit  of"
"observing the demeanour and the deportment of the witnesses. It is the"
"trial judge who would have the benefit of observing the manner in which"
"a  witness  faces  the  cross  examination.  Hence,  in  the  absence  of  any"
"other infirmities, having considered all these matters, if the trial judge"
"forms  the  opinion  that  the  witness  is  credible,  I  do  not  think  the  trial"
"judge has any other option other than to accept the evidence and to act"
"on it”."
