"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  in  his  judgment  had  considered  all  these"
"circumstances to arrive at the conclusion that the evidence of the victim had"
"passed all the tests in this case. Therefore, these two grounds are also devoid"
"of any merit."
"In the fifth ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the learned High"
"Court Judge had failed to give due weightage to the fact that the prosecution"
"failed to produce in evidence the testimony of the independent witness who"
"was allegedly with the victim, the failure of which caused a serious doubt on"
"the case for the prosecution."
