"Considering  the  above  cited  judicial  decisions  and  the  writings,  as  the"
"credibility  of 
the  evidence  of  a  child  witness  would  depend  on 
the"
"circumstances of each case, it is the duty of the Learned Trial judge to assess"
"and decide on the evidence given by child witness."
"As the appeal grounds one and two are interrelated as it speaks about the"
"judgement, 
the  said 
two  grounds  will  be  considered 
together 
in 
this"
"judgment."
"When  this  matter  first  came  up  before  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  who"
"delivered  the  judgment  on  10/05/2016,  both  parties  agreed  to  adopt  the"
"proceedings led up to that point and continue the case."
"As the learned High Court Judge who delivered the Judgment did not hear"
"any  single  witness  before  him,  acting  under  Section  439  of  the  Code  of"
"Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979, made an order to recall PW1 to enable"
"him  to  observe  the  demeanour  and  deportment  of  the  witness.  But  on"
"26/01/2017, 
the  counsel  appearing 
for 
the  aggrieved  party  made  an"
"application to cancel the said order considering the mental and psychological"
"status of PW1 as she was preparing for her Advanced Level Examination at"
"that  time.  As  the  State  Counsel  too  supported  the  said  application,  the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  cancelled  the  said  order  and  fixed  the  case  for"
"judgment on 30/03/2017."
"The  judgment  was  postponed  for  26/05/2017  and  the  said  learned  High"
"Court  Judge  who  had  delivered  the  judgment  too  had  been  transferred."
"Hence  this  case  had  come  before  a  new  judge  on  26/05/2017.  But  the"
"learned High Court Judge who delivered the judgment was re-appointed to"
"conclude 
this  matter  on  27/06/2017.  Accordingly, 
the 
judgment  was"
"delivered on 26/02/2018. Hence, it is apparent that no unnecessary delay"
"had taken place as submitted by the learned Counsel for the Appellant."
