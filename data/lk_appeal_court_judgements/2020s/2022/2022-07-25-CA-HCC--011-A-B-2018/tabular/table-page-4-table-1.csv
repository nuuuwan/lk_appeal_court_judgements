"the room where they played by making her lie on the bed. The Appellant had"
"then proceeded to pull down her under-garment up to knee level and raised"
"her skirt and placed the Appellant’s male organ on her female organ and had"
"pressed  it  hard.  Although  it  was  painful,  the  victim  had  not  shouted  out."
"After the act, the Appellant had told her  not to be afraid and that nothing"
"would happen to her."
"When the children who went downstairs to retrieve the ball knocked on the"
"door,  the  Appellant  had  opened  the  door  and  had  let  them  in.  In  the"
"meantime, the victim had come out of the room after getting properly dressed"
"and left the Appellant’s house."
"When  she  returned  home,  both  her  parents  were  already  there.  She  had"
"divulged  the  incident  to  her  mother  when  she  had  developed  a  burning"
"sensation in her vagina following a body wash. Upon being questioned by her"
"mother, she had informed her of two previous instances where similar abuse"
"had been committed on her by the Appellant when she went to play at the"
"Appellant’s house. But she had not informed anybody as the Appellant had"
"praised her for being a good girl and had asked her not to tell her parents."
"After listening to her daughter’s recount of events, the victim’s mother, PW2"
"had  conveyed  the  information  to  the  Appellant’s  wife  and  had  taken  the"
"victim to the Air Force Base Hospital. From there the victim was transferred"
"to the Kalubowila Hospital. Thereafter she was taken to Mount Levinia Police"
"Station. After recording her statement, she was again taken to Kalubowila"
"Hospital for medical examination."
"The  JMO  had  observed  a  0.4  cm  mucosal  abrasion  on  the  left  side  of  the"
"external genitalia just lateral to the hymen. According to the opinion of the"
"JMO, the injury noted on the victim’s vagina was quite consistent with the"
"history recounted by her."
