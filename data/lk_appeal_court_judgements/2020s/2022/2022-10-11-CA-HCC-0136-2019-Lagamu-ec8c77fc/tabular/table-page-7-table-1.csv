"13.  In  case  of  Himachal  Pradesh  v.  Thakuar  Dass"
"1993 2 Cri 1694 it was held that"
"“whenever  a  statement  of  fact  made  by  a"
"witness  is  not  challenged    in  cross-examination,"
"it has to be concluded that the fact in question is"
"not disputed. ”"
"This 
position 
was 
also 
taken 
in  Wannaku"
"Arachchilage 
Gunapala 
v. 
Attorney-General"
"[2007] 1 Sri L.R 273."
"14.  In the instant case, as I have mentioned before, the"
"evidence  of  the  PW17  that  the  statement  “X”  was"
"made  by  the  appellant  voluntarily  has  not  been"
"challenged in cross examination. Thus, the position"
"taken  by  the  appellant  in  his  unsworn  statement"
"from 
the  dock 
that  his  signature  was  obtained"
"through 
threat, 
promise 
or 
oppression 
at 
the"
"defence  stage  seems 
to  be  an  afterthought  and"
"could  not  be  accepted.  Therefore,  I  find  that  the"
"prosecution  has  proved  beyond  reasonable  doubt"
"that  the  statement  “X”  was  made  by  the  appellant"
"voluntarily, making it admissible in evidence."
"15.  No 
leaked  question  papers  were 
found 
in 
the"
"possession  of  the  appellant.  The  investigators  have"
"proceeded 
to  record 
the  statement 
“X” 
from 
the"
"appellant,  on  the  basis  that  the  copies  of  question"
"papers  that  were  found  in  the  possession  of  PW19"
"were  handed  over  to  him  by 
the  appellant.  The"
"PW19  was  indicted  in  the  High  Court  of  Kandy  for"
"having in possession two question papers knowingly"
"or  having  reason  to  believe  that  they  were  stolen"
"property. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced. The"
"PW19  was  called  to  give  evidence  on  behalf  of  the"
"prosecution  in  the  instant  case.  In  his  examination"
"in  chief,  he  has  said  that  the  question  papers  that"
"were  found  in  his  possession  were  handed  over  to"
"him  by  some  unknown  person.  As  the  PW19  was"
"not  giving  evidence 
in 
favour  of  the  prosecution,"
