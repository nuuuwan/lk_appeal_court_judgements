"17.  Thus, as  I  have mentioned  before,  it  is evident  that"
"the  confession  “X”  has  been  made  voluntarily.  It  is"
"important 
to 
consider 
the 
truthfulness 
of 
the"
"statement  and  that  has  to  be  decided  on  the  facts"
"and  circumstances  of  each  case  based  on 
the"
"evidence. It is evident that the appellant was one of"
"the  officers  who  were 
involved 
in  numbering  the"
"question  papers  having  access  to  the  same.  The"
"investigators 
(PW17  and  PW2)  have  gone 
to 
the"
"Maradana  railway  station,  where  they  recorded  the"
"statement  upon  receiving 
information 
from  PW19"
"that 
the  appellant 
is  at 
railway 
the  Maradana"
"station.  When 
considering 
the 
contents 
of 
the"
"statement 
“X”, 
it 
is  clear 
that 
the 
facts  stated"
"therein  are  true.  Therefore,  the  learned  trial  Judge"
"was  correct  in  admitting  the  confession  in  evidence"
"as well as relying on the same."
