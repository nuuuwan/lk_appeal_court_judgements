"not mean that a crime had not been committed. That may be the reason why"
"courts  are given authority  to  dispose of  property  when it  appears  to court"
"that  an  offence  has  been  committed  in  respect  of  any  property.  When  the"
"court finds that there is no evidence to prove a charge, there is no rule that"
"the  property  against  which  an  offence  appears  to  have  been  committed"
"should be returned to the person from whom it was taken.”"
"Therefore,  such  discretion 
is  granted 
to 
the  Court  not 
to  dispose"
"productions  related  to  an  offence  without  any  reasoning,  but  to  provide"
"judges further opportunity to prevail justice in instances such as failure"
"to  dispense  the  burden  of  proof  where  there 
is  a  prima 
facie  case."
"Therefore, holding a disposal inquiry is not a hindrance to the discretion"
"of court but rather provides a pre-requisite in arriving at a just decision."
"Basnayake  J.  in  Jayagoda  &  another  v.  Attorney  General  (supra)"
"further provided an example on this matter where he stated;"
"“If 
that 
is 
the  case  criminals  could  obtain 
the  maximum  benefit  by"
"eliminating  all  the  evidence  against  them.  To  illustrate  this  point  if,  for"
"example,  X  robbed  a  bank  and  hid  the  loot  but  one  day  got  caught  and"
"showed the police where the loot was, admitting to the police that he robbed"
"the bank and what was shown was part of the loot, and yet got an acquittal"
"due to lack of evidence, should the court return the money to X to be taken"
"away? This is the reason why the law empowers court to ‘make such order"
"as it thinks fit for the disposal of property produced before it’”."
"In  the  case  at  hand,  at  no  point  in  the  course  of  the  proceedings  the"
"ownership  of  the  cattle  has  been  proven  to  be  of  the  respondents."
"In Thirunayagam v. IP Jaffna 74 NLR 163 it was held that,"
"“I  am  in  agreement  with  the  view  that  it  is  open  to  a  Magistrate,  where"
"special  circumstances  exist,  to  order  property  to  be  delivered  to  a  person"
"other than the person from whose possession it was seized.” Therefore, it"
"is  not  right  before  the  eyes  of  the 
law  to  dispose  the  cattle  to  the"
"respondents without any disposal inquiry merely because the respondents"
"were acquitted in appeal."
