"committed or which has been used for the commission of any"
"offence”. (Emphasis added)."
"Subsection (4) to section 425 defines property to include such property as"
"has been originally in the possession of any party or property converted or"
"exchanged and anything acquired by such conversion or exchange."
"From the wordings of the provision, it is evident that the legislature has"
"placed its trust in the judiciary to determine the disposal of the property"
"under section 425. The learned ASG appearing for the petitioners relied on"
"decided case law on this subject in support of his contention."
"In  the  case  of  Meegahapola  Vs  OIC  Harbour  Police  and  Another  it  is"
"decided that:"
"“An  acquittal  from  a  charge of  possession  of  25 radio  cassettes  does not"
"entitle the accused to receive the productions as the police took them from"
"him. Under Section 425(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the court"
"after inquiry must make such order as it thinks fit in regard to the disposal"
"of the productions. The claimant should have satisfied court that he was the"
"real  owner  of  the  productions  in  court.  Instead  by  relying  on  his  acquittal"
"and not adducing evidence after raising a preliminary objection, he left the"
"Magistrate with no alternative but to confiscate the productions.”"
"Furthermore, in Jayagoda & Another v. Attorney General (2006) 2 Sri"
"L.R. 387, it was held that:"
"“At the conclusion of a trial when an accused is acquitted, a court may not"
"always find whether an offence was committed. What the court finds out is"
"whether  the  accused  had  committed  a  crime.  There  may  be  numerous"
"occasions where although crimes are committed no charges are successfully"
"brought against anyone. It may be that the accused’ are not known or that"
"the evidence is not sufficient or that the witnesses cannot be traced. A court"
"will  not  just  go  in  to  the  question  whether  a  crime  had  been  committed"
"against  a  person  or  property  unless  there  is  a  person  who  can  be  held"
"responsible. Even if a particular accused could not be found guilty, it does"
