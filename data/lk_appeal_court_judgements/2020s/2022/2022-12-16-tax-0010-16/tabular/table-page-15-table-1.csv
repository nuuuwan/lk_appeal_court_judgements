"the general business of the company. I do not think therefore that these"
"items  are  assessable  as  such.  The  ordinary  rule  under  section  9(1)"
"therefore applies and the deductions claimed can be allowed in their"
"entirety [emphasis added]."
"[40] On the question whether or not the deductions mentioned in the general"
"rule under section 9(1) (corresponding to section 25(1) of the IRA) applies to all"
"“sources” of income under section 6(1), Keuneman J. held that the deductions"
"mentioned  in  section  9(1)  apply  to  all  “sources  of  profit  and  income”  in  the"
"following words (p. 23):"
"“I  only  repeat  that  the  deductions  mentioned  in  section  9  apply  to  all"
"“sources” of profit and income”."
"[41]  It  is  relevant  to  note  that  Keuneman  J.  took  the  view  that  section  9(3)"
"applies where the interest is a separate source which is not embedded in the"
"business in producing its aggregate income and refused to apply section 9(3)"
"as the income was embedded in its general activities in producing its aggregate"
"income."
"[42] Having considered the word “any source” which is employed in section 9(1),"
"which refers to either 6(1)(a) or 6(1)(e), Keuneman J. deducted the management"
"expenses in relation to interest earned by the company under the general rule"
"in section 9(1) (correspond to section 25(1) of the IRA) and not under the special"
"rule  in  section  9(3).  On  that  basis,  the  deduction  of  management  expenses"
"claimed arising from interest was allowed as outgoings and expenses incurred"
"in  the  production  of  the  income  under  section  9(1),  which  corresponds  to"
"section 25(1) of the IRA 2006."
"[43] Applying the said principles of law, Keuneman J. finally allowed the appeal"
"and deducted the management expenses incurred in the production of income"
"in relation to dividends and interest in ascertaining the assessable income of"
"the company under section 9(1) (corresponding to section 25(1) of the IRA)."
"[44] The combined effect of the test applied by Howard CJ., and Keuneman J."
"(with  Wijewardene,  J.  agreed)  was  that  “if  the  business  of  a  company  or"
"individual consists in the receipts of dividends, interests or discounts alone, or"
"if such business can be clearly separated from the rest of the trade, business,"
"then section 3(1)(e) will apply. In other words, if the business of a company or"
"an individual consists in the receipts of dividends, interest or discounts and such"
"business cannot be separated from the rest of the trade or business, and the"
