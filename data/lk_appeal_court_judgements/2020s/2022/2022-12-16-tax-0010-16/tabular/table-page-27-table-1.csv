"Appellant  from  interest  cannot  be  separated  from  the  profits  earned  by  the"
"Appellant from its banking business, as it is embedded in its banking business"
"activities. I accordingly hold that in the present case, the income derived by the"
"Appellant  from  interest  falls  within  the  words  “profits  from  business”  under"
"section  3(a)  of  the  IRA  2006.  I  do  not  find  any  force  in  the  argument  of  Mr."
"Ameen that the interest income earned by the Appellant Bank falls within the"
"term “interest” under section 3(e) of the IRA 2006."
"Is the Appellant disentitled to the exemption under section 9 where the"
"income earned falls within the words “profits from business” under section"
"3(a)?"
"[
83] It was the initial contention of Mr. Ameen that as the interest income in"
"question falls within the meaning of section 3(e), such interest income should"
"be exempt in terms of section 9(b) and 9(d) of the IRA 2006. At the hearing on"
"28.11.2022, Mr. Ameen however, drew our attention to the stand taken by the"
"Appellant’s Representative, Mr. Jayanethi, before the TAC (p. 153 of the brief)"
"that the treatment of interest as business profits does not preclude the grant of"
"exemption to the Appellant since the  interests contemplated in sections 9(b)"
"and  9(d)  are  falling  to  be  treated  as  business  profits.  The  contention  of  Mr."
"Balapatabendi was however, that where the interest in question falls within the"
"meaning of section 3(a), the exceptions under section 9 are not applied to the"
"Appellant."
"[84] Now the question is whether the exemption claimed by the Appellant under"
"section 9 applies to the source of profits and income earned by the Appellant"
"under section 3(e) of the IRA 2006 only, or  where the source of income falls"
"exclusively under section 3(a), the exemption under section 9 is inapplicable to"
"the Appellant. In other words, the question is whether, the classification of the"
"interest  as  business  profits  under  section  3(a)  precludes  the  Appellant  from"
"claiming the benefit to the exemption under section 9 of the IRA 2006."
"[85] The TAC in its determination referred to section 107(3)(c) of the IRA 2006"
"and held that the nature of the business of the Appellant falls exclusively under"
"section 3(a) and not under section 3(e), the Appellant is not entitled to claim"
"the  exemption  under  section  9(b)  unless  specifically  excluded  by  any  other"
"provisions  of  the  IRA  2006.  The  second  is  that  the  TAC  decided  that  the  Its"
