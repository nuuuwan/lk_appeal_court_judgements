"fulfilment are not met. In Nanayakkkara v. University of Peradeniya (1991) 1 Sri"
"LR. 97, at p. 102, S.N. Silva, J. as he then was) expounded this proposition in the"
"following words:"
"“A necessary corollary of applying the rule of strict construction to determine"
"liability under a taxing statute, is that any provision granting an exemption"
"from such liability be given its full effect. Exemptions are provided for by the"
"Legislature for the purpose of giving a measure of relief to a person who would"
"otherwise  be  liable  to  tax  under  the  general  rule.  Therefore,  no  restriction"
"should be placed on such provision by way of interpretation so as to defeat"
"the purpose of granting such exemption”."
