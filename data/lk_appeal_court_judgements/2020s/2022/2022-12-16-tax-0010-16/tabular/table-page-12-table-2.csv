"Howard C.J. Keuneman J. first proceeded to consider in what circumstances will"
"interest be a source under section 6(1)(a) or under section 6(1)(e). Keuneman J.,"
"laid down the following test at pp. 261-262 of the judgment:"
"â€˜How then are we to treat income which comes under source (e) but can also"
"be regarded as coming under source (a)? In my opinion, it was the intention"
"of  the  Ordinance  to  regard  dividends,  interest  or  discounts  as  a  separate"
"source.  If  then  the  business  of  an  individual  or  a  company  consists  in  the"
"receipt of dividends, interest or discounts alone, or if the business of receiving"
"dividends, interest or discounts can be clearly separated from the rest of the"
"trade or business, then any special provisions applicable to dividends, interest"
"or discounts must be applied. I do not think any question of opinion arises."
"(Emphasis Added)."
"Option  of  the  Income  Tax  Officer  to  elect  the  source  of  income  under"

"[
32] In the question whether the Crown had an option to elect the source of"
"income,  the  majority  of  the  Judges,  comprising  Keuneman  J.,  Soertsz  J.  and"
"Kretser J. held that the Crown had no option to elect whether it will assess under"
"section 6(1)(a) or 6(1)(e).  Keuneman, J. specifically stated at p. 20 that section"
"47  of  the  Income  Tax  Ordinance,  which  correspond  to  section  99  of  the  IRA"
