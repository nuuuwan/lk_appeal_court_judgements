"[47]  The  above  passage  of  the 
judgment  of  Soertsz  J.  suggests  that  the"
"following  test  would  apply  to  identify  whether  the  profits  and  income  of  an"
"individual or business fall within section 3(1)(a) or 3(1) (e):"
"1. 
If  the  profits  or  income  received  from  dividends  or  interest  or  discounts"
"appertains to the business, it will fall within the profits of any business under"
"section 6(1)(a);"
"2. 
If  the  profits  or  income  received  from  dividends  or  interest  or  discounts"
"accruing to an individual was earned, not in the course of a business, but"
"as  a  part  of  his  income  from  simple  investments,  it  falls  within  section"
"3(1)(e)."
"[48] The test applied by Soertsz J. that section 6(1)(e) is limited to an income of"
"an “individual” and section 6(1)(a) is limited to the profits of any “business” is"
"not, in my view  consistent with the  scheme  of the  IRA 2006, which does not"
"restrict the application of section 3(1)(e) to an individual. In my view, the tests"
"laid down by Howard CJ., and Keuneman J., are significant to identify the source"
"of  profits  or  income  under  which  chargeability  arises  and  to  decide  in  what"
"circumstances,  will  the  dividends,  interest  or  discounts  be  a  source  under"
"section 3(a) or 3(e). The identification of the source of profits or income is also"
"significant to apply the general rule of deduction under section 25(1) or special"
"rules  of  deduction  under  section  25(1)(a)  -(w)  of  the  IRA  2006  to    particular"
"sources  or  profits  or  income,  irrespective  of  whether  the  source  falls  under"
"section 3(a) or 3(e) of the IRA 2006."
"[49] Applying the above principles adopted in the majority decision of the CFI"
"judgment, we will now proceed to consider whether the interest income earned"
"by the Appellant falls within the words “profits from any business” under section"
"3(a) or under the term “interest” under section 3(e) of the IRA 2006."
"Double  Taxation  Avoidance  Agreement  (DTAA)  between  India  and  Sri"
"Lanka"
"[50] Before, we proceed to classify the source of income of the Appellant under"
"section 3(a) or 3(e), it is relevant to consider the effect of the Double Taxation"
"Avoidance  Agreement  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  “DTAA”)  between  India"
"and Sri Lanka. The DTAA applies to taxes on income and capital imposed on"
"behalf of each Contracting State irrespective of the manner in which they are"
"levied (Article 2.2). The existing taxes to which this Convention shall apply in Sri"
"Lanka are (i) the income-tax, including the income-tax based on the turnover of"
