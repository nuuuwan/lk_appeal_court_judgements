"attention as distinguished from sports or pleasure; (iii) it is used in the sense of"
"occupation continuously carried on for the purpose of profit. He explained the"
"word “business” at pp. 258-259 as follows:"
"“Now ""business” itself is a word of large and indefinite import. I have before"
"me the last edition of Johnson's Dictionary, edited by Dr. Latham, and there"
"the  first  meaning  given  of  it  is,  ""Employment,  transaction  of  affairs”;  the"
"second,  ""an  affair”;  the  third,  ""subject  of  business,  affair,  or  object  which"
"engages  the  care.”  Then  there  are  some  other  meanings,  and  the  sixth  is,"
"""something to be transacted.” The seventh is, ""something required to be done.”"
"Then taking the last edition of the Imperial Dictionary, which is a very good"
"dictionary, we find it a little more definite, but with a remark which is worth"
"reading: ""Business, employment; that which occupies the time and attention"
"and labour of men for the purpose of profit or improvement.” That is to say,"
"anything which occupies the time and attention and labour of a man for the"
"purpose  of  profit  is  business.  It  is  a  word  of  extensive  use  and  indefinite"
"signification. Then, ""Business is a particular occupation, as agriculture, trade,"
"mechanics,  art,  or  profession,  and  when  used  in  connection  with  particular"
"employments it admits of the plural that is, businesses.”"
