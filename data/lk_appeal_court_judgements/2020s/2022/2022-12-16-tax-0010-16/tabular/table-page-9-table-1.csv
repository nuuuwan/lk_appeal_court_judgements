"[21]  Unlike  in  the  present  case,  the  assessee  argued  in  the  CFI  case  that  the"
"interest income should be treated as a source under section 6(1)(a) of the Income"
"Tax  Ordinance  1932  (corresponding  to  section  3(a)  of  the  IRA  2006),  and  the"
"assessor  in  disallowing  the  management  expenses  claimed  drew  a  distinction"
"between an investment company and a company which carried on a trade or"
"commercial  enterprise.  The  assessor  stated  however,  that  (i)  an  investment"
"company does not incur any expense in the production of income, and once the"
"investment was made, no further expenditure was necessary for the production"
"of its income from the investment; and (ii) section 10(b) also precluded any such"
"deduction  as  claimed.  The  assessor  treated  the  interest  income  under  section"
"6(1)(e) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1932 (corresponding to section 3(e) of the"
"IRA 2006) and disallowed the deduction of management expenses in producing"
"its interest income in terms of section 9(3) of the Income Tax Ordinance  1932"
"(corresponding  to  section  25  (4)  of  the  IRA  2006).  The  Commissioner  also"
"disallowed the management expenses claimed as deductions from the income"
"of the company and the Board of  Review confirmed the determination of the"
"Commissioner."
