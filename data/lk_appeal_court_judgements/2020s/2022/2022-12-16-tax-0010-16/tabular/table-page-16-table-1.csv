"business,  it  falls  within  3(1)(a),  and  where  it  is  related  to  an  income  of  an"
"individual,  as  part  of  his  business,  it  falls  within  section  6(1)(e).  The  relevant"
"passage of the judgment at p. 252 reads as follows:"
"“The view I have reached is that the categories enumerated in section 6 (1)"
"are mutually exclusive, and that the question whether 6 (1) (a) or 6 (1) (e)"
"applies  in  a  particular  case,  depends on  whether  we  are  dealing  with  the"
"profits of a business or the income of an individual. If it is a case of dividends,"
"interests, or discounts appertaining to a business, they fall within the words"
"“profits of any business” and section (6) (1)(a) applies. If, however, it is a case"
"of dividends, interest or discounts accruing to an individual not, in the course"
"of  a  business,  but  as  a  part  of  his  income  from  simple  investments,  then"
"section 6 (1) (e) is the relevant section, and so far as interest is concerned,"
"section 9 (3) modifies section 9 (1)” (Emphasis added)."
