"appellant company in the CFI case was formed as an investment company, it"
"carried on business in the way of a holding company and that everything that"
"accrued to the company, in the course of its business, by way of pecuniary gain,"
"whether by way of dividends, interest, discounts or some other thing falls within"
"the words “profits from any business”."
"Expenses incurred in the production of dividends"
"[34] Both Howard C. J, and Keuneman J. turned to the management expenses"
"incurred  in  relation  to  dividends,  arising  from  the  production  of  income  and"
"held that they are necessary and reasonable expenses (p. 22). Howard C.J. and"
"Keuneman J. recognized that section 9(1) which relates to ascertaining of profits"
"and  income  of  any  person  applies  to  “all  the  sources”  of  income  set  out  in"
"section 6(1), but places interest on a different footing under section 6(1)(e), if"
"such interest can be separated from the rest of the trade or business."
"[35] Howard C.J. having regard to the facts of the case, held that the  income"
"derived by the Appellant from dividends and interest falls within the meaning"
"of section 6(1)(e) of the Income Tax Ordinance, and the management expenses"
"can  be  deducted  as  outgoings  and  expenses  incurred  in  the  production  of"
"income and profits under section 9(1). Howard C.J.  agreed with  Keuneman J."
"that the Commissioner was empowered to charge the company under section"
"6(1)(e) in respect of dividends and interest received in the production of profits"
"and income under section 9(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance."
"Expenses incurred in earning dividends"
"[36]  As  far  the  deduction  of  management  expenses  in  relation  to  dividends,"
"which 
the  company  obtained  was  concerned,  Keuneman 
J. 
rejected 
the"
"submission of the Crown that the company has not done anything to produce"
"the  income  or  profits  under  section  9(1).  Keuneman  J.,  held  that  section  9(1)"
"“would therefore prima facie apply to all the sources in section 6(1)(a) to (h)” (p."
"21). Keuneman J., further rejected the argument of the Crown that nothing has"
"been done by the company to produce the income or profits, and held that the"
"management  expenses  claimed 
in 
the  case  have  been 
incurred 
in 
the"
"production  of 
the 
income.  Keuneman 
J., 
further  held 
that  management"
"expenses  incurring  in  the  production  of  income  can  be  deducted  from  any"
"source, 
including 
from  source  6(1)(e)  and  agreed  with  Keuneman  J.  that"
"management  expenses  incurred  by  the  company  could  be  deducted  under"
"section 9(1) of the Income Tax ordinance."
