"In Palaniappa Vs. Saminathan [(1913) 17 NLR 56] at page 58, it was held:"
"â€œNo matter what were the respective rights of parties inter se, they are abandoned in"
"consideration of the acceptance by all of a new agreement. The consequence is that"
"when  such  as  accord  and  satisfaction  takes  place,  the  prior  rights  of  parties  are"
"extinguished.  They  have  in  fact  been  exchanged  for  the  new  rights;  and  the  new"
"agreement becomes a new departure, and the rights of all parties are fully represented"
