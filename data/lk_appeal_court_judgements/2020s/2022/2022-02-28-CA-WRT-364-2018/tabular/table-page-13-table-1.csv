"certiorari, a basic characteristic of the writ is that there should not be an unjustifiable"
"delay in applying for the remedy”."
"Our Courts have continuously held that a party seeking public law remedies specially by way of"
"writ applications should do so without delay as delay defeats the reliefs sought. If there is a delay"
"it is incumbent on the party seeking the relief to explain the delay to the satisfaction of the Court."
"For the reasons best known to the Petitioner, this Court finds that the Petitioner has failed to give"
"any reason to purge the delay or to answer the allegation of delay."

"This is based on the premise that Petitioner on his request has been referred to a medical board"
"and the said board after examining him, has unanimously determined that he is fit to carry out his"
"usual duties (R5). The Respondents contention is that by R4 the Respondents have specifically"
"stated   the   reason   for   submitting   the   Petitioner   before   the   board   and   the   board’s   unanimous"
"decision in this regard is contrary to what the Petitioner is stating."
"While the Petitioner’s contended that what the medical board has stated is that the Petitioner is"
"suitable to carry out his usual duties and it means his usual office work, the Respondents argued"

"submitted by the medical board who examined the Petitioner, thus making the medical fitness of"
"the Petitioner, a disputed fact."
"This Court is mindful that a writ Court is not in a position to come to a conclusion on disputed"

"condition to succeed, the Petitioner’s mental health condition has to be put in issue. It is trite law"

"For completeness, this Court will consider the Petitioner’s submission on the obligation owed to"
"him.  The   Petitioner   contends   that  the  Respondents   should  have  acted   under  clause  8 of  the"
"contract. Clause 8 (b) gives the discretion to the Director General to terminate and recall the"
