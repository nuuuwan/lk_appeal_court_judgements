"As  such,  I  hold  that  the  decisions  by  the  Respondents,  inter  alia,  to"
"suspend and thereafter expel the Petitioner from the University, does merit"
"the necessary requirements stipulated by law and are also in line with the"
"principles  of  natural  justice.  In  this  respect,  I  hold  that  the  impugned"
"decisions are not liable to be quashed and that the Petitioner is not entitled"
"for a Writ of Mandamus to reinstate his studentship."
