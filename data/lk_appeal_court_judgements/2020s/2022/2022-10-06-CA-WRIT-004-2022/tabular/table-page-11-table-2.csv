"1951 SCR 228 the issue on saving clause has been discussed by referring to the following"
"passage from Wall v. Chesapeake & Ohio Ry., Company (125 N. E. 20);"
"""It is well settled that if a Statute giving a special remedy is repealed without a saving clause"
"in favour of pending suits all suits must stop where the repeal finds them. If final relief has"
"not been granted before the repeal went into effect, it cannot be after. If a case is appealed, and"
"pending the appeal the law is changed, the appellate court must dispose of the case under the"
"law  in  force  when  its  decision  was  rendered.  The effect of  the repeal is  to  obliterate  the"
"statute repealed as completely as if it bad never been passed, and it must be considered as a"
"law  which  never  existed,  except 
for  the  purposes  of  those  actions  or  suits  which  were"
"commenced,  prosecuted  and  concluded  while  it  was  an  existing  law.  Pending 
judicial"
"proceedings based upon a statute cannot proceed after its repeal.‚Äù"
