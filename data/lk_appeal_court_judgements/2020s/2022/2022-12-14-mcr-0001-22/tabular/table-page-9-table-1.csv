"The unacceptability of a contrary interpretation of Section 120(3) of the CPC is further"
"reinforced  by  the  later  formulation  of  Section  186  in  the  CPC  which  empowers  the"
"Magistrate  to  discharge  a  suspect  at  any  time.  This  section  in  furtherance  to  an"
"individual’s right to personal liberty and freedom. Every individual is entitled to be free"
"from arbitrary detention or prosecution in any instance where the commission of a crime"
"cannot be sufficiently ascertained through investigations. Thus, it is within the power"
"of a Magistrate to discharge such suspects, in order to uphold their rights."
"In  this  regard,  this  Court  would 
like  to  echo  the  words  of  his  Lordship  Justice"
"Gunawardana 
in  Abdul  Sameem  v  The  Bribery  Commissioner 
(1991)  1  S.L.R."
"“Furthermore, whilst appreciating the pressures on time and the large volume of work the"
"Magistrate’s Courts are called upon to handle, it is nevertheless important, that rights of"
"an accused person are safeguarded and that he be brought to trial according to accepted"
"fundamental principles of criminal procedure”"
"As discussed at the outset, under Chapter XI of the CPC, there are several threshold"
"requirements for a complaint to proceed within the stipulated sequence of investigation."
"For  instance,  the  investigating  officer  must  be  satisfied  of  “sufficient  evidence  or"
"reasonable  grounds  of  suspicion” 
to 
justify 
the 
forwarding  of  a  suspect 
to 
the"
"Magistrate’s Court (Section 114 and 116 of the CPC). When such a suspect is brought"
"before a Magistrate to consider whether he or she ought to be discharged under section"
"120(3)  of  the  CPC,  it  is  implied  that  the  Magistrate  should  use  his  discretion  in  a"
"judicious  manner  to  assess  whether  the  threshold  requirement  has  been  met  and"
"whether there is prima facie case against the suspect."
"In light of this, it is the considered view of this Court that the impugned order of the"
"learned Magistrate has failed to satisfy this burden envisioned under Section 120(3) of"
"the CPC. A mere statement such as “ඒ අ(cid:489)ව බැ(cid:613)බැ(cid:610)මට (cid:319)(cid:462)ත(cid:592)(cid:486)ට එෙර(cid:655)ව (cid:541)මාණව(cid:430) සා(cid:250)(cid:639) පව(cid:431)න"
