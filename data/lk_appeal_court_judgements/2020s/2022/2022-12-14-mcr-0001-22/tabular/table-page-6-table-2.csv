"It  must  be  noted  that  the  application  of  Section  120(3)  is  informed  by  its  preceding"
"Sections which reflects the continuous sequence of formulations within the CPC. Hence"
"Section 120(3) must be read within its context where it is placed under Chapter XI of"
"the  CPC  titled  “Information  to  Police  Officers  and  Inquiries  and  Their  Powers  to"
"Investigate”  contained  in  Part  V  of  the  CPC  titled  “Investigation  of  Offences”.  It  is"
"significant to note that, with the exception of Section 115 which deals with a specific"
"circumstance,  Section  120(3)  is  the  first  time  the  CPC  recognizes  the  power  of  a"
"Magistrate to intervene during or at the conclusion of an investigation under Chapter"
"IX. This further reinforces the contemplation by drafters that Section 120(3) ought not"
"to be read in a vacuum."
"As such, it must be noted that prior to a Magistrate discharging a suspect under Section"
"120(3) of the CPC, Section 114 of the CPC provides for the release of a person under"
"investigation from custody (upon a bond) on the basis of deficient evidence. As such,"
"the  threshold  for  such  release  is  stipulated  as  “it  appears……………that  there  is  not"
"sufficient  evidence  or  reasonable  ground  of  suspicion  to  justify  the  forwarding  of  the"
"accused to a Magistrate’s Court…”. While such release is not akin to a discharge by the"
"Magistrate as envisioned in Section 120(3) (under Section 114, the person is released"
"upon executing a bond or released under the direction to appear when so required before"
"a Magistrate), the threshold requirement of “sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of"
"suspicion” points to the context  in which Section  120 of the CPC must  be evaluated."
"This contention is further reinforced by Section 116 of the CPC which stipulates another"
"threshold  requirement      for  an  officer  or  inquirer  to  forward  a  case  to  a  Magistrate’s"
"Court if  sufficient information is well founded or if further investigation is necessary."
"Therefore,  even  before  a  completed  investigation  arrives  at  Section  120,  the  CPC"
"delineate a criterion of sufficiency. Bearing this context in mind, we now turn to examine"
"Section 120(3) of the CPC."
