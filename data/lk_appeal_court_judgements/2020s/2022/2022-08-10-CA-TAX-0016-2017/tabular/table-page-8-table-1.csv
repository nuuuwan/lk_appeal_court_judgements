"It is within common knowledge that sap collected from the coconut flower"
"is allowed to be fermented by the simple process of exposing it to air and"
"converting  it  into  toddy.  Coconut  sap  is  also  converted  to  sugar  syrup"
"(treacle) or jaggery by simply heating at a high temperature and allowing"
"the excess water to evaporate. Likewise, coconut shells, fibre and fibre pith"
"are also used to manufacture various products. The issue is whether such"

"The  Income  Tax  exemption  under  Section  16  (2)  (a)  is  granted  to  an"
