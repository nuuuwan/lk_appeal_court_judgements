"pith4.  The  Respondent  described  the  above  activities  as  an  agricultural"
"undertaking within the scope of Section 16 (2) (b)."
"The  Respondent  cited  three  cases  involving  Canro  Coco  Peat  (Private)"
"Limited v. CGIR5 and submitted that the TAC has made a similar decision"
"holding that the processing of coir fibre pith by cleaning, sorting, grading"
"and  packing to  bring  it to  a  marketable  product  fall  within the  ambit of"
"Section 16 (2) (b). In all three cases the CGIR, moved the TAC to state a"
"case to the Court of Appeal but later withdrew all three appeals.6"
"The Respondent argued that the withdrawal of the appeal amounts to a tacit"
"admission of the correctness of the TAC determination. The Appellant’s"
"reply  was  that  those  were  settlements  and  also  were  not  involving  the"
"identical product. However, the documents annexed to the Respondent’s"
"written  submissions  marked  X1,  X2  and  X3  clearly  establish  that  in  all"
"those  three  cases  the  matters  in  issue  were  the  income  tax  exemption"
"claimed  for  exporting  coir  fibre  separated  from  the  coconut  husk  and"
"sorted, graded and packed into bundles. Be that as it may, since this Court"
"has  not  delivered  any  judgment  in  those  three  cases,  the  orders  made"
"allowing the withdrawal of the appeal on the application of the Appellant"
"cannot be considered as a binding precedent of this Court."
"The  Appellant  cited 
the 
judgement  of 
the  Madras  High  Court 
in"
"Commissioner of Income Tax v. Stanes Amalgamated Estates Ltd.7 wherein"
"the Court adopted the approach that the produce must retrain its original"
"character in spite of the process. It was held that Eucalyptus oil extracted"
"from the leaves were not agricultural produce. However, it is important to"
"note  that  the  relevant  Section  in  the  Indian  statute  and  our  statue  are"
"materially  different.  Therefore,  in  my  view  the  judgement  of  the  Indian"
"High Court cannot be even a guideline in deciding the case in hand."
"The  Appellant  further  argued  that  the  Respondent's  production  process"
"involves manufacture of agricultural products and not production of such"
"products.  The  Appellant  relied  on  the  Respondent’s  own  ‘Notes  to  The"
"Financial Statements’ for the year ended on 31st March 2011 wherein the"
"Respondent’s  accountants  KPMG  had 
stated 
that 
the  Respondent’s"
"principal  activity 
is 
the  manufacture  and  export  of  coir 
fibre  pith"
