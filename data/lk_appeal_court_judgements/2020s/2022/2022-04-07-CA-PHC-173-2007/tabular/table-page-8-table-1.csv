"Then the Provincial Council created the “Development Construction and Machinery Agency” and"
"absorbed the Petitioners into the said agency. The Petitioners had suppressed this fact."
"T
herefore, they become unsuitable for praying for a writ pointing out the decision of  Alponsu"
"Apphuhamy Vs. Hetarachchi1 reads as when an application for a prerogative writ or an injunction"
"is made; it is the duty of the Petitioner to place before the court before it issues notice in the first"
"instance  a  full  and  truthful  discloser  of  all  the  material  facts.  The  Petitioner  must  act  with"
"“Uberrima fides”. Speaking of Jayaweera Vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services2"
"“Petitioner seeking a prerogative Writ is not entitled to relief as a matter of right or as a"
"routine.  Even  if  he  is  entitled  to  relief,  still  court  has  the  discretion  to  deny  him  relief"
"having  regard  to  his  conduct,  delay,  laches,  waiver,  submissions  to  jurisdiction  are  all"
"valid impediments which stand against the grant of relief”."
"The Respondents  based their arguments  on the ground  that the application was  misconceived."
"The  Petitioners’  relationship  with  the  Respondents  depends  on  a  contract.  The  Petitioner,"
"therefore, seeks payment on the contract."
"T
herefore,  a  writ  of  Mandamus  is  not  available  to  the  Petitioner.  The  Petitioner  had  failed  to"
"disclose the statutory provision that has been violated. He had not established the legal right he"
"had or the legal duty on the part of the Respondents."
"A

"will not or should not be considered a legitimate expectation."
"C
onsidering the submissions of both parties, first and foremost, following reasoning, I set aside"
"the order of the provincial High Court Judge. It was not the duty of the learned High Court Judge"
"to  determine  whether  the  Petitioners'  service  was  in  excess  or  they  had  derived  a  salary  or  a"
"payment without contributing."
