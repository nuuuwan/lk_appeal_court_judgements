"given  his  phone  to  Sadha  to  continue  the  deal.  They  had  to  wait  about"
"nearly  five  hours  to  complete  their  mission.  As  Sadha  was  not  aware  that"
"PW1  and  his  team  were  police  officers,  PW1  had  discreetly  disclosed  their"

"Narcotic  Bureau.  Upon  interrogation,  the  Appellant  had  revealed  that  the"
"contraband  seized  from  him  belongs  to  a  person  called  Delington  Leema"
"from  Kalpitiya.  PW1  and  his  team  thereafter  had  gone  to  arrest  the  said"
