"In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 decided"
"on 24/05/1995 held that:"
"“A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although"
"we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are"
"of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to"
"fill  the  gaps  of  badly  handled  prosecutions  where  the  identity  of  the"
"good  analysis  for  examination  has  to  be  proved  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt”."
