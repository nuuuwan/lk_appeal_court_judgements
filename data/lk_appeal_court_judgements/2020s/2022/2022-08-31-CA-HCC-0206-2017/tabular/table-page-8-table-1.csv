"In  The  Attorney  General  v.  Devunderage  Nihal  decided  on  03/01/2019"
"Aluwihare, PC J., held that:"
"a)  “An  accused 
can  be 
convicted  on  a  single  witness 
in  a"
"prosecution  based  on  a  police  detection,  if  the  judge  forms  the"
"view  that  the  evidence  of  such  witness  can,  with  caution,  be"
"relied upon, after probing the testimony”."
"In  this  instant  appeal,  the  prosecution  had  led  the  evidence  of  PW1  and"
"PW2 
to 
show 
how 
the 
police 
team 
prepared, 
gathered 
necessary"
"information,  acted  on  that  information  and  arrested  the  Appellant  with"
"Heroin  on  08/02/2012  at  Mohaththuwaram,  Kalpitiya.  The  learned  High"
"Court  Judge  had  accurately  analysed  the  evidence  presented  by  both"
"parties  to  arrive  to  his  conclusion.  Hence,  it  is  incorrect  to  say  that  the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  had  only  relied  upon  the  evidence  of  PW1  to"
"come to his conclusion. Therefore, this ground of appeal has no merit."
"The  second  ground  of  appeal 
is  that  PW1  had  not  disclosed  the  best"
"evidence to the court even though he had the information."
"Following the best evidence rule is very important  in criminal trials, as the"
"criminal  justice  system  considers  that  an  accused  to  be innocent  until"
"proven  guilty and 
the  guilt  of 
the  accused  has 
to  be  proved beyond"
"reasonable  doubt and  not  on  a  mere  prevalence  of  probabilities,  thus"
"imposing  upon  the  prosecution  the  obligation  to  adduce  the  best  possible"
"evidence to prove the guilt of the accused."
"Therefore, in proving the guilt of an accused, the investigating  officers are"
"duty bound to collect the best possible evidence and the public prosecutor"
"is  bound  to  present  the  best  possible  evidence  to  prove  an  alleged  fact  or"
"circumstance leading to the commission of the offence. A failure to lead the"
"best  evidence 
thus  makes 
the  prosecution  vulnerable 
to  an  adverse"
