"Thus,  there  is  no  conflict  between  the  eyewitness's  account  and  the"
"medical evidence."
"The  next  argument  is  that  PW1  said  that  her  father's  sarong  had  come"
"out and fallen while running, and at the time of the attack, he was clad"
"only  in  a  shirt  and  underwear.  As  per  the  police  and  medical  evidence,"
"the  deceased  had  a  sarong.  Both 
the  police  officer  and 
the  doctor"
"inspected  the  body  of  the  deceased  at  the  hospital.  PW3  had  taken  the"
"deceased  to  the  hospital.  PW3  would  have  definitely  put  the  sarong  on"
"the  deceased  before  taking  him  to  the  hospital.  If  there  was  a  doubt  on"
"the  evidence  of  PW1,  the  defence  should  have  questioned  PW1.  This"
"position  was  not 
even  put 
forward 
to  PW3.  Without 
such  being"
"questioned by either PW1 or PW3, the argument of the appellants cannot"
"be sustained to create doubt in the evidence of PW1. Further, it is highly"
"unlikely that someone would take an injured person to a hospital naked"
"without covering him first. This argument, therefore, cannot be accepted."
"The next argument is that PW1 had not mentioned any physical features"
"on  the  assailant, 
  such  as  height,  gait  or  other  particulars 
in  her"
"statement, to the police. The necessity for such things did not arise here"
"as  she  had  categorically  stated  the  names  of  the  appellants  and  the"
"police had no reason to ask about the physical features when the witness"
"named  the  assailants.  PW1  knew  the  assailant  very  well  as  they  were"
"neighbours."
"It  was  argued  that  no  reasons  had  been  adduced  by  the  Learned  Trial"
"Judge for placing reliance on the evidence of  the eyewitness. This is not"
"so.  The  Learned  Trial  Judge  has  given  reasons  as  to  why  she  relied  on"
"the evidence of PW1. We also do not see reasons to doubt the evidence of"
"PW1.  The  Learned  Trial  Judge  has  observed 
that,  at 
the 
time 
the"
"deceased  was  taken  to  the  hospital,  the  names  of  the  assailants  were"
"made known to the hospital police post. They have informed the incident"
