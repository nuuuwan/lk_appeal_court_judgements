"(c) 
no improvements to the said land have been effected after the Order for possession"
"under paragraph (a) of section 40 had been made; and"
"(d) 
the person or persons interested in the said land have consented in writing to take"
"possession of such land immediately after divesting Order is published in the Gazette."
"[emphasis added]"
"This provision has been discussed in the following cases:"
"In Kingsley Fernando v. Dayaratne, [1991] 2 SLR 129, his Lordship S.N. Silva J."
"(as he then was) held:"
"“
Section 39A (1) vests a discretionary power in the Minister to divest any land that"
"has vested upon an order under Section 38 when possession has been taken for or on"
"behalf of the State, to be exercised only if the pre-conditions set out in paragraphs (a) to"
"(
d
)
 of subsection (2) are satisfied. The provision does not have the effect of giving a"
"statutory right to any person who had an interest in the land prior to vesting, to demand"
"the exercise of this power by the Minister.” [emphasis added]"
"In Kapugeekiyana v. Janaka Bandara Tennakone, Minister of Land [2013] 1 SLR"
"192, her Ladyship Tilakawardane J. held:"
"“
It is the assessment of this Court that to grant a divesting order on behalf of the"
"Petitioner as per Section 39 A of the Act, the four conditions set out in Section 39 A (2)"
"must be satisfied.” [emphasis added]"
"In De Silva v. Atukorale [1993] 1 SLR 283, his Lordship Fernando J. held:"
"“If compensation has been paid or improvements have been made, then despite the"
"inadequacy of justification, divesting is not permitted. The purpose and the policy of the"
"amendment is to enable the justification for the original acquisition, as well as for the"
"continued retention of acquired lands, to be reviewed; if the four conditions are satisfied,"
"the Minister is empowered to divest. Of course, even in such a case, it would be legitimate"
