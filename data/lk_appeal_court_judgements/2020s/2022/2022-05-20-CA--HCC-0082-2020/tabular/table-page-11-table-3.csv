"a  specific  date  has  been  mentioned  in  the  charge,  unlike  the  appeal  under"
"consideration, it was held in the case of R. Vs. Dossi 13 Cr. App. R. 158;"
"“That a date specified in an indictment is not a material matter unless it is"
"essential  part  of  the  alleged  offence,  the  defendant  may  be  convicted"
"although  the  jury  finds  that  the  offence  was  committed  on  a  date  other"
"than  that  specified  in  the  indictment.  Amendment  of  the  indictment  is"
"unnecessary, although it will be good practice to do so. Provided that there"
"was no prejudice, where it is clear on the evidence that if the offence was"
"committed on the day other than that specified.”"
