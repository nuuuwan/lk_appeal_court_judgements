"Learned  High  Court  Judge  has  not  considered  common  intention  in  his"
"judgment. In this judgment the court held that:"
"“The  conviction  of 
the  appellant  on 
the  basis  of  his  having"
"entertained  a  common  intention  along  with  the  other  accused"
"cannot  stand  as  the  Judge  had  failed  to  discuss  this  rule  and"
"apply it to the facts of the case. The prosecution must prove the"
"essentials ingredients of common intention namely a sharing of a"
"common  intention  and  participation  in  the  commission  of  the"
"offences”."
"“Where 
the  prosecution  relies  on  circumstantial  evidence 
for"
"common 
intention 
then 
the  principle 
is 
that 
the 
inference  of"
"common intention should not be reached unless it is a necessary"
"inference, an only inference, an inference from which there is no"
"escape. Failure  to  apply  these  tests  will make the conviction on"
