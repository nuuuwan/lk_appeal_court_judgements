as the Board also failed to consider and recognize that the reasons for an award granted by an"

"of Review, if it is not so requested by the owner of the acquired property prior to such review?"
"The Respondent denies this Question of Law. The hearing of the appeal commenced before the"

"the  rate  of  Rs  48,000  per  perch,  which  clearly  proves  that  the  said  value  is  reasonable  and"
"justifiable according to the direct approach method of valuation."

"directing that compensation be paid at the rate of Rs. 48,000/- per perch for 320 perches for extent"
"of the acquired land, is well founded, thus I see no reason for us to interfere with the order of the"
"Board of Review dated 12.03.2019."
