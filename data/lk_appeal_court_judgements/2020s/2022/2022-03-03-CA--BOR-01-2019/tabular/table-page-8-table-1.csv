"It is apparent that the Board has not misdirected itself in considering and concluding that the nature,"
"access, extent, use, lie and the location of the acquired property is equivalent to the nature, access,"
"extent, use, lie and the location of the properties of which the deeds of transfers, past valuations"
"and past awards were placed before it by the Respondent."
"It is worthy to note that, naturally there is a demand for lands situated in the close proximity of"
"school premises for residential development. Since the school is a ‘National School’, thus the a"
"value for this two acre land could be arrived at by a reasonable man taking in to consideration the"
"price fetched by the abutting land which had a commercial value, of course by making necessary"
"adjustments to the figures of the sale. Apparently, the land in question is strategic to the School."
"T
he ‘Board’ has analyzed sales of the Appellant in 3rd and 4th paragraph of page 10 of the ‘Order’"
"in arriving at the market value of the acquired land."
"T
he attention of Court was drawn to the sales schedule marked and produced as R9 and valuation"
"of  gross  development  value  as  R8(c)  submitted  to  the  ‘Board’  by  the  District  Valuer  of  the"
"Valuation Department on behalf the Chief Valuer (the Expert Valuer of the Appellant)."
"I
n view of the document R8(c), it clearly indicates the valuation of gross development value per"
"perch for Rs. 320/- and Rs. 9,800,000/- as market value."
"I
t  appears  that,  No.259  (iii)  of  the  Land  Manual  (‘A1’)  submitted  by  the  Appellant  clearly"
"mentioned that ‘If it is the opinion of the Acquiring Officer that the Valuation Report of the Chief"
"Valuer is not in accordance with the evidence given at the inquiry, in terms of Section 9 of the"
"Land Acquisition  Act,  he should inform  it  to the Chief Valuer and shall get  his  consent  for an"
"amendment to the valuation."
"It was submitted by the Appellant-Respondent that in the appeal before the Board of Review, no"
"evidence were led by the Respondent-Appellant to substantiate that the Appellant had complied"
"with that direction given in the land manual. Chairman of the ‘Board’ observed this situation and"
"commented that ‘The Acquiring Officer cannot act as a Rubber Stamp of another Officer’."
"It is only after the confirmation of the Chief Valuer that the valuation tendered to the Acquiring"
"Officer is ‘Reasonable’, the Acquiring Officer (the Respondent-Appellant) should proceed to make"
"the ‘Award’ based on the valuation of the Chief Valuer."
"I
t was contended by the Appellant, that the Board of Review had erred in Law in disregarding the"
"powers given to the Chief Valuer of the Government and his agents by the provisions of Section"
"55 of the Land Acquisition Act."
"In respect of the said question of Law, the Appellant-Respondent had drawn the attention of Court"
"to Section 24 (5) of the Land Acquisition Act."
