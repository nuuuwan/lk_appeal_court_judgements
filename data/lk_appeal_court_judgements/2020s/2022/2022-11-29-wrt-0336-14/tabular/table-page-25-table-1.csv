"27(a) “That I commenced my business in 1997 and close down the business on 21.2.2011”"
"This averment by the 1st Petitioner by way of his own admission once again demonstrates that the"
"owner and employer of Ruwan Lanka Garments is the 1st Petitioner. There is also an admission"
"that he closed the business on 21.02.2011. Subsequently, he states that the CEO continued the said"
"business for another two months. This contradicts his conduct and the statement given at the police"
"station and his admission of non-payment of salaries as well as his undertaking to pay the salaries,"
"but the Petitioner has failed to substantiate his argument of the continuation of the business by the"
"CEO with any material evidence. In view of the above admission, it is the view of this Court, that"
"it was incumbent on the Petitioner to demonstrate the status of the employees after the closure or"
"whether the closure was informed to the relevant authorities under the prevailing statutes."
