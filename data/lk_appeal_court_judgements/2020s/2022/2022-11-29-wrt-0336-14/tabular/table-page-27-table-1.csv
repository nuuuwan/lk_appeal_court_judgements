"closed the business entity or that there was a transfer of the employees with their consent to another"
"entity."
"As per the material available, and in the absence of any explanation as to what happened to the"
"employees  when  Ruwan  Lanka  Garments  was  removed  from  the  business  names  registry,  this"
"Court is satisfied that the commissioner has come to the correct conclusion on termination."
"This  brings  us  to  the  next  ground  as  to  whether  the  2nd  Petitioner  had  sufficient  notice  of  the"
"inquiry."
"Notice to the 2nd Petitioner"
"The 2nd Petitioner contends that before the commencement of the inquiry, he had not been issued"
"any notice pertaining to an inquiry against Ruwan Lanka Garments. He does not challenge the fact"
"that  he  is  a  partner  in  the  said  entity.  Under  section  17  of  the  Termination  of  Employment  of"
"Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, it is clear that an inquiry should be conducted to protect the"
"rules of natural justice. The 2nd Petitioner argued that throughout the proceedings of the inquiry,"
"the 2nd Petitioner had never been notified of the said inquiry. It was his contention that only the 1st"
"Petitioner had been notified and had appeared at the inquiry, it was also pertinent to note that the"
"1st Petitioner is the father of the 2nd Petitioner. It is observed that the 1st Petitioner even though he"
"made  the  2nd  Petitioner  a  partner  in  the  partnership,  had  never  mentioned  before  the  inquiring"
"officer that Ruwan Lanka Garments was a partnership and about the existence of the other partner."
"With the available  material,  it is evident that Ruwan Lanka started as a sole proprietorship  and"
"eventually changed its status to a partnership on 28 July 2010. Thereby the 2nd Petitioner too has"
"been added as a partner. Strangely, when the Petitioner instituted action against Jayalath Padmalal"
"his CEO in the Commercial High Court, we find that the Petitioner has never disclosed to the Court"
"that Ruwan Lanka Garments is a partnership. He has failed to disclose that Ruwan Lanka Garments"
"is  a  partnership  nor  was  the  2nd  Petitioner  involved  in  the  litigation  before  the  CHC.  The  1st"
