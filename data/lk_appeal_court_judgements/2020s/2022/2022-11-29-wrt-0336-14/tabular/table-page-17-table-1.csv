"T
his Court observes that the Petitioner’s objection to the inquiring officer going ahead with the"
"inquiry was due to the expectation that he would succeed  in a declaratory  judgment against the"
"CEO,  whereby  he  could  pass  the  liability  to the  CEO.  However,  as  per  the  proceedings  of  the"
"inquiry that was submitted to this Court, the  inquiring officer has specifically stated that in the"
"absence of any interim order from the Commercial High Court to suspend the inquiry under the"
"Termination  of  Employment of  Workmen  (Special  Provisions)  Act,  he  would  proceed  with  the"
"inquiry to decide who the employer  is and the  issue of termination at the said  inquiry. This we"
"believe was due to the inquiring officer’s concern that he could not  wait for a protracted trial to"
"come to an end to decide whether the employees had been terminated legally or not. However, the"
"inquiring  officer  had  correctly  given  the  option  to  the  Petitioners  to  obtain  a  restraining  order"
"prohibiting him from conducting the inquiry under the Termination of Employment of Workmen"
"(Special Provisions) Act.  This Court was not submitted with any documents to demonstrate that"
"the Petitioner had been successful in obtaining a restraining order from the Commercial High Court"
"to stop the inquiry that was being carried out under the said Act."
