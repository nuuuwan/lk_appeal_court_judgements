"present for an inquiry1. Another notice had been sent to the business entity with a copy to the 1st"
"Petitioner asking to be present for an inquiry2."
"The 1st Petitioner had failed to be present for the inquiry and after several dates, the 1st Petitioner"
"had given authorization to one Mr. Jayadeva Ruwanpura to represent him and appear at the said"
"inquiry.  As per the proceedings on  09.09.2011, the said authorized person  had appeared with a"
"lawyer to represent the employer, partnership “Ruwan Lanka Garments”."
"It was submitted by the Respondents that at the inquiry it had also been revealed that on a complaint"
"made by the employees to the police, the 1st Petitioner had been summoned by the Wellampitiya"
"police for an inquiry. At the said inquiry the 1st Petitioner and the employees had been present and"
"the  1st  Petitioner  had  given  a  statement  dated  06.08.2011  admitting  that  as  the  business  was"
"incurring  losses,  he  was  compelled  to  close  Ruwan  Lanka  Garments  in  May,  and  he  had  also"
"admitted that he had failed to pay the employees from the month of May3. The 1st Petitioner had"
"also  given  the  undertaking  to  dispose  of  the  machinery  of  the  said  factory  and  to  settle  the"
"payments."
"This  position  was  challenged  by  the  2nd  Petitioner.  The  Petitioners  contended  that  the  said"
"statement had been obtained under duress. However, this Court observes that if the said complaint"
"had  been  obtained  under  duress,  then  the  1st  Petitioner  had  ample  opportunity  to  go  with  his"
"lawyers  and  complain  to the  higher  authorities  in the  police.  No  such  material  was  tendered to"
"Court. In the absence of such material, this Court is not inclined to accept the contention of duress"
"as submitted by the Petitioners."
