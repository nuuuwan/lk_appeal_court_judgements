"L.R. 281;"
"""The Establishments Code is the basic document relating to procedures of disciplinary action"
"against public officers. It has been formulated by the Cabinet of Ministers under Article 55(4)"
"of the Constitution in whom such a power is reposed. This formulation has the characteristics"
"of a policy decision as it deals with the broad principles and procedures governing disciplinary"
"action against officers of practically the entire public service in this country……”"
"“…...The administration of the public service is now an internal matter of the Executive. It"
"would however appear that the Cabinet, after due deliberation, has sought to formulate a"
"Code  of  regulations  containing  fair  procedures  and  safeguards  balancing  the  requirements"
"and interests of the Government with the rights of public officers, and the legal protection now"
"provided by the law to public officers is contained in this Code. These procedures are therefore"
"mandatory and cannot be superseded or disregarded without due legal authority."""
