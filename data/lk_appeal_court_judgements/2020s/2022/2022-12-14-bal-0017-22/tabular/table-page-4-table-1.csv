"State on numerous occasions before this Court that facts of a case should"
"not be gone into at the time of considering a bail application."
"Hence  as  the  suspect  has  been  in  remand  for  a  period  of  over  one  year"
"without any administration of justice taking place against or for him we are"
"of  the  view  that  justice  can  be  done  only  by  enlarging  the  above  named"
"suspect on bail."
"As such we direct the Magistrate to enlarge the above named suspect on"
"suitable conditions of bail on receipt of this order."
