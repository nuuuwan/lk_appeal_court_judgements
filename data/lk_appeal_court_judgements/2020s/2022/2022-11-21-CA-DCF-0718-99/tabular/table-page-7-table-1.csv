"However, at the trial the 8th Defendant had changed his position and taken up a"
"different stand which is materially different to the case he has placed before Court"
"by his statement of claim. In evidence he has stated as follows;"
"“ඒ අක්කර 4යි රුඩි 3යි පේ  චස් 30යි විශාල ඉඩෙත්ත ො විසින් අයිිවාසිකේ කිය  වී.  01"
"ලල්ඛණලේ  සදහන්  කර  ිලෙ   අක්කර  2යි  රුඩි  1යි  පේ  චස්  9ක්  ඉඩෙත්ත  එක  ස්ථා ලේ"
"පිහිටා ිලෙන්ලන්. එකෙ ප්පලෑන්  එලකන් ලකාටස් ලවන් කර ිලෙ  ඉඩේ ලදකක්. ෙලේ"
"අයිිය ලපන්නුේ කර ිලෙ  ඉඩෙ ලව  එකක්. පැමිණිලිකරු අක්කර 4යි රුඩි 3යි පේ  චස්"
"30ක ඉඩෙ ලව ෙ ඉඩෙක්.”"
"The 8th Defendant had stated in his evidence that the land shown by the Plaintiff as"
"the corpus in this case and the land claimed by the 8th Defendant are two different"
"lands.  The  two  lands  are  situated  close  to  each  other  but  the  two  lands  are"
"separately shown in a plan. Therefore, the 8th Defendant had stated that the land"
"described  in  the  statement  of  claim  of  the  8th  Defendant  is  a  different  land."
"Therefore, it cannot be a portion of the corpus. However, the 8th Defendant had"
"taken up the position that the land claimed by him or at least a portion of it had"
"come into the corpus at the preliminary survey when he testified as follows;"
"“ඒ නිවස ිලෙ  ලකාටස 'වී 1' වශලයන් ලකුණු කර ිලෙ  ලල්ඛණයට ඇතුළු ලවලා"
"ිලෙ වා”."
"However, the 8th Defendant had not taken out an alternative commission either to"
"the Commissioner of the case or to the Survey General and shown that the land"
"claimed by him had been included into the corpus at the preliminary survey and"
"claimed for an exclusion of that portion on that basis."
"The Prescriptive Rights of the 8th Defendant"
"Issue no.12 had been raised at the trial by the 8th Defendant on the basis that he"
"had  acquired  a  prescriptive  right  to  the  land  and  the  house  shown  as  ‘A’  in  the"
"preliminary  plan  (ඒ  අක්ෂරලයන්  සදහන්  නිවස  සහ  ඉඩෙ)  by  long  and  continued"
"possession. The issue itself is vague. When he refers to the word ‘ඉඩෙ’ it is not"
"clear whether he is claiming a prescriptive right to the entirety of the corpus in this"
"case  or  whether  he  is  claiming  a  prescriptive  right  to  the  land  described  in  his"
"statement of claim. But according to the averments in the statement of claim of"
"the 8th Defendant it is apparent that the 8th Defendant is claiming for a prescriptive"
