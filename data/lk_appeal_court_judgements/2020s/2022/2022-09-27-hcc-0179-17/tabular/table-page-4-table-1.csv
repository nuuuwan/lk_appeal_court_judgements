"Even though technically this evidence may not be relied upon after such person is treated as"
"an  adverse  witness,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  accused-appellant  requested  to  take  into"
"consideration  such  material  in  order  to  avoid  a  miscarriage  of  justice.  According  to  this"
"witness, the deceased had come about half an hour later and Cyril had been there even at"
"that time. The evidence of this witness dated 14.12.2016 had been led as ""Examination in"
"Chief' and subsequently he had been cross-examined by the State Counsel."
"In  cross-examination  by  the  State  Counsel,  this  witness  had  stated  that  while  he  and  his"
"brother Cyril were fighting with the accused, the deceased had come there. According to this"
"witness,  the  deceased  had  then  asked  ""පුංචි  මහත්තග ෝ  ගමොකද්ද  කරන්ගන්?”  At  that  time,"
"""Puncha"" (the accused-appellant) had assaulted the deceased with a club, on the head. This"
"witness had admitted that he stated this in his police statement."
"The  Learned  Trial  Judge  had  allowed  the  application  of  the  defence  Counsel  to  treat  this"
"witness as an adverse witness under section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Defence"
"Counsel had been permitted to continue with the examination in chief and the State Counsel"
"had been permitted to cross-examine this witness. The evidence of the defence counsel had"
"been led under the heading ""examination in chief”. However, the Learned Trial Judge has not"
"taken into consideration the evidence of this witness."
"In the circumstances of this case, the learned President's Counsel for the accused-appellant"
"requested this Court to consider taking into account the evidence of this witness, in order to"
"avoid a miscarriage of justice in this case."
"When this matter was taken up for argument learned counsel for the respondent had taken"
"the view that the charge could be reduced on the basis of a sudden fight."
"The  accused-appellant  had  given  a  dock  statement  embarking  upon  a  plea  of  a  grave  and"
"sudden provocation and exercising the right of private defence. The learned Trial Judge had"
"rejected the defence version on the footing that although the appellant had indicated there"
"was a fracas between him and the deceased."
"It warrants mentioning that the position taken up by the accused-appellant is consistent and"
"the  following  factors  are  placed  before  the  court  to  consider  lesser  culpability  based  on  a"
"grave and sudden provocation or sudden fight of exceeding the right of private defence."
