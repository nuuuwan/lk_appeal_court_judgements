"Accused-Appellant. On this alleged ground the latter was arrested and remained in the custody of"
"the Police before being produced in the Magistrate's Court."
"It is important to note that the appellant for the first time, took up the position at the trial that he"
"did  not  make  his  statement  voluntarily  to  the  police.  The  learned  trial  Judge  in  analysing  his"
"evidence observed that he did not take up that position at the Magistrate Courts either before or"
"during the non-summary inquiry. He has also observed that in the absence of any prior complaint,"
"it is not safe to act on a belated statement."
"In support of the above grounds of appeal, the learned counsel for the accused-appellant cited an"
"FR  Application.  The  learned  counsel  submitted  that  as  per  the  recent  Judgement  delivered  by"
"Justice Wanasundara in SC FR Application No. 244 / 2010 a victim who underwent an experience"
"of torture by police officers may not have confidence in the legal system. It is as follows;"
"""Nobody who was tortured at a police station would ever be scared to complain to the"
"Judge at such a time when he was at the mercy of the Judge and the police to get bail. If"
"any human being gets tortured by the police at any time, the victim by that time has lost"
"confidence in the whole system of justice. Such a person would not have any other feeling"
"than  to be  wanting to  live  by getting  away  from  the  custody of the police  for  the time"
"being. He would not be in his proper senses as to think what could be done next. He would"
"have suffered mentally and physically inside a cell, without anybody to give him food or"
"drink or medicine or to save him from the torture that he was undergoing during the period"
"he was within the Police Station in the recent past, for whatever number of hours or days"
"he was tortured."""
"The case of Sudath Silva Vs Kodithuwakku 1987 (2) SLR 119, was also cited by Justice Wanasundara"
"in  the  above-mentioned  FR  Application,  where  Her  Ladyship  quoted  the  judgement  of  Justice"
"Atukorale as follows;"
"""The failure of the Petitioner to complain to the Magistrate before whom he is produced"
"must be viewed and judged against the backdrop of his being at that time, held in police"
"custody with no access to any form of legal representation."""
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  accused-appellant  submitted  that  the  above-ground  on  which  the"
"learned High Court Judge supported his order is bad in law."
