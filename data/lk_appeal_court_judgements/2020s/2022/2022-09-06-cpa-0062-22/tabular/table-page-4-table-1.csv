"which the Court selects the cases where the extra ordinary power of revision should be"
"exercised” .Therefore what this Court must decide at this juncture is whether there is a"
"prima  facie  error  or  irregularity  established  in  the  order  in  review  to  issue  notice  on"
"the respondents."
"Keeping  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  above  case,  this  Court  draws  its  attention  to"
"another judgment of the  Supreme Court SC  Appeal 7/2004 by Justice  Marsoof where"
"Section  33  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  has  been  extensively  analyzed.  In  the  same"
"judgment their Lordships have quoted ERSR Kumaraswamy, The Law of Evidence, Vol 1"
"(pages 492 to 493) where it has been stated, “the Court has to exercise the power given"
"in Section 33 with great caution and must insist on strict proof before holding that the"
"witness is dead or cannot be found or has become incapable of giving evidence or has"
"been  kept  out  of  the  way  by  the  adverse  party  or  his  presence  cannot  be  secured"
"without an unreasonable amount of delay and expense. But once any of the first four"
"conditions of death, not being found, incapacity to give evidence, or being kept out of"
"the way by the adverse party has been proved , the Court has no discretion and must"
"admit  the  deposition  ,  since  Section  33  declares  such  deposition  to  be  relevant  and"
"therefore admissible”. The judgment further says that, “Kumaraswamy concedes that a"
"Court of law does have the discretion with respect to the last condition in Section 33"
"relating to a witness whose presence in court cannot be obtained without an amount"
"of delay or expense which the Court decides to be unreasonable. The present case does"
"not arise from such a situation and there is no such a way for a dead witness to give"
"evidence.”"
"In the instant matter the respondents have taken steps to satisfy the Learned High Court"
"judge that Witness No. 1 and 2 cannot be brought to Court without unreasonable delay."
"Therefore, the High Court Judge has held that the said steps taken by the respondents"
"fall within the ambit of the Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance."
