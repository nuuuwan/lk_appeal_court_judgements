"P
W1 stated in her evidence that the rapist was a person who came with Jagath"
"to  pluck  coconuts.  PW1  further  said  that  she  had  seen  the  appellant  on  that"
"occasion  and  also,  she  had  seen  the  appellant  going  about  in  a  hand  tractor."
"However, in her complaint to the police, she had not mentioned that the person"
"who raped her had come to her house earlier with Jagath to pluck coconuts."
"PW1 should have stated to the police that she had seen the accused before the"
"incident.  She  has  failed  to  mention  this  fact.  The  defence  had  drawn  the"
"attention of the Court to this vital omission in the statement made to the police"
"by  PW1.  In  the  event  PW1  does  not  know  the  name  of  the  rapist,  the  police"
"would ask her whether she has seen the person before the incident or whether"
"the  person  is  someone  known  to  her.  This  type  of  vital  omission  could  not"
"happen if she had ever seen the appellant before the incident."
"The  next  important  fact  regarding  the  identity  of  the  rapist  is  that,    PW1  has"
"stated  that  the  rapist  lit  a  lighter  to  show  his  face  to  her  and  mentioned  that"
"he 
is  Sugath  and  asked  her  whether  she  could  not  recognize  him. 
It 
is"
"improbable that the person who switched off the lights to conceal his identity"
"would  show  his  face  using  a  lighter.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  not"
"considered  the 
improbability  of  this  evidence. 
If  he  wanted  to  reveal  his"
"identity,  he could have switched on the lights."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  herself  asked  a 
leading  question  after  re-"
"examination of PW1, assuming that at some point the lights were switched on."
"On page 94 of the brief the Learned High Court Judge has asked the following"
"question;"
"අධිකරනයෙන්;-"
