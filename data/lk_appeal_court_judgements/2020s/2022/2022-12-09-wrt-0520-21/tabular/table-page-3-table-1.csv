"event  with  the  approval  or  concurrence  of  the  Minister  of  Sports  for  an"
"activity related to sports and had not returned to Sri Lanka;’"
"The  contention  of  the  Petitioner 
is  that  the  disqualification  set  out 
in  the  Gazette"
"Notification ‘P8’ has no bearing on the Petitioner as those regulations were published after"
"he returned from Japan. Anyhow, the Federation referring to the desertion of the team"
"during the tour to Japan, informed the Petitioner by letter dated 25.04.2017, marked ‘P10’,"
"that the Petitioner had acted in contrary to clause 4(s) of Part II of the ‘P8’ and thereby he"
"would not be entitled to apply to the post of a coach of any National team with effect from"
"25.04.2017."
"Subsequently, upon such decision of the Federation, the Petitioner made an appeal to the"
"Minster of Sports by way of letter dated 07.01.2021, marked ‘P11’. The Appeal made by"
"the  Petitioner  has  been  rejected  on 
the  basis 
that  the  Appeal  Committee  was  not"
"empowered to examine the same in terms of the Sports Regulations as it had been lodged"
"against  a  decision  taken  almost  4  years  ago.  The  rejection  of  the  Appeal  has  been"
"communicated to the Petitioner by the impugned letter dated 08.02.2021 and letter dated"
"15.03.2021, marked ‘P12’ & ‘P13’ respectively."
"The Petitioner claims that the said letters marked ‘P12’ and ‘P13’ are ultra vires, arbitrary"
"and violative of his legitimate expectation of fair and transparent hearing and he seeks,"
"inter alia, for a writ of Certiorari to quash the decisions reflected in ‘P12’ and ‘P13’."
"The  Respondents  raised  the  following  two  preliminary  objections  when  the 
instant"
"application was taken up in this Court for support;"
