"mentioned earlier for his misconduct of deserting the National Team and not returning to"
"Sri Lanka after the Tour, although such punishment has been relaxed later on. This reflects"
"that  the  said  misconduct  of  the  Petitioner  has  become  a  purported  offence  not  only  by"
"operation of Clause 4(s) but even in the year 1995 (during the tour to Japan) such conduct"
"was in the nature of an offence."
"Hence,  it  cannot  be  assumed  that  the  effect  of  such  Clause  4(s)  tends  to  disregard  an"
"identical misconduct or an offence (described in the said clause) upon which a punishment"
"has been imposed before 2016 (probably in the year 1998). I am mindful of the principles"
"relating  to  retrospective  effect  upon  laws. When  interpreting  the  Clause  4(s),  I  take  the"
"view  that  the  respective  misconduct,  which  has  been  identified  even  before  2016  as  a"
"misconduct or an offence committed at that time, cannot be possibly overlooked for the"
"purpose of Clause 4(s) and it will not affect the principles on retrospective laws."
"The other argument advanced by the Petitioner that the said Clause 4(s) is applicable only"
"to the members of the Sports Association, also cannot be accepted as there is no adequate"
"material submitted by the Petitioner to establish, prima facie, that he was not holding any"
"paid  or  unpaid  office,  a  category  which  clearly  comes  within  the  purview  of  the  above"
"Clause  4.  By  plain  reading  of  the  said  Clause,  it  clearly  envisages  that  a  post  of  coach"
"comes within the definition of “paid or unpaid office/post”."
"Additionally, the Petitioner contends that the Minister’s approval was not a necessity for"
"him to tour Japan in 1995 and thereby, the Regulations discussed above are not applicable"
"to him. The purported basis for such argument is that although the words ‘approval or the"
"concurrence of the Minister’ is embodied in said Clause 4(s), the Petitioner’s tour to Japan"
"has been approved not by the Minister but by the North Western Provincial Council. I am"
"not  inclined  to  examine  such  assertions  as  the  Petitioner  admittedly  underwent  the"
"punishment imposed in reference to the Japan tour and such decision for punishment had"
"not  been  challenged  in  a  court  of  law.  The  concession  provided  subsequently  by  the"
"Federation in respect of the said punishment would not negate this position. Anyhow, the"
"Petitioner has categorically submitted in the instant application that he is challenging only"
"the decisions reflected in ‘P12’ and ‘P13’."
"In passing, I comment that there cannot be any compromise  on any act or misconduct"
"which brings disrepute to the motherland when you represent the country as a team or as"
