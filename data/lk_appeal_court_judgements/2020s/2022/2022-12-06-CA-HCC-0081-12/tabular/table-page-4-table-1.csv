"deposition of PW 3 was produced through the court interpreter whose evidence was also led"
"at the trial."
"After the prosecution case was concluded the 1st and 2nd accused-appellants gave evidence"
"from the witness box and thereafter evidence of the defence witnesses were led."
"The first accused-appellant totally denied his involvement with the incident. According to the"
"evidence given by the first accused person he had stayed at home after work on the day of"
"the incident. He was taken into custody by the LTTE in connection with this offence. It seems"
"that the alleged offence was committed in the ""unliberated area"" in that part of the country."
"According to the accused, he was released after three months. After one month he was asked"
"to come to the Kaluvanchikkudi Police Station where he was arrested. The accused-appellant"
"admitted  the  fact  that  the  distance  between  his  place  and  the  place  where  the  incident"
"occurred is one mile."
"According to the statement of the defence witness Nallathamby Pillaiammah, while she and"
"her  sister  were  standing  near  the  gate  of  their house,  the brother  of the  deceased  Rasiah"
"Vianayagamoorthy who was intoxicated at that time, came running towards them and had"
"given an axe to the sister saying ""here hold this child, I have done away with the thug"". It"
"seems the defence witness had not handed over the axe to the police nor had she made a"
"statement to the police. For the first time she had narrated this story at the High Court. She"
"has not given evidence as a defence witness at the non- summary. She denied the presence"
"of the 1st and 2nd accused-appellants at the location of the incident. Learned Counsel for the"
"respondent says that this is a total fabrication on the part of the defence witness in order to"
"safeguard her brother who is the 1st and 2nd accused-appellants."
"The second accused has totally denied his involvement. He had gone threshing and returned"
"the following day morning around 4o'clock. The Following day, the LTTE took him into their"
"custody. He was released after three months and thereafter was an inmate in a refugee camp"
"for another 3 months. A week after returning from the refugee camp he was arrested by the"
"police."
"Conviction  revolves  around  the  evidence  of  namely  Ponnuthurai  Thirumanjanam  (PW  2),"
"(wife of the deceased) and the deposition of Nagamani Thevi which was admitted in terms of"
"section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"It transpires from the evidence of the wife of the deceased that the incident had taken place"
"around 8.30 pm. and it was her evidence that the deceased had been at home having had his"
"dinner  and that  the  1st accused  accompanied  by  the  2nd  accused  who was  the  14-year-old"
"grandson of the 1st accused had come and called out to the deceased and that the deceased"
"had left in the company of the said accused. This witness has further testified that about 15-"
"30 minutes later her sister-in-law namely Nagamani Thevi had given a message to the effect"
"""Anna had been beaten up"" which prompted the witness to rush to the scene at which point"
"she  had  seen  the  deceased  fallen  lying  unconscious  and  it  was  her  evidence  that  the  two"
"accused were at the scene armed with weapons. A material contradiction has been marked"
"at the trial: Her evidence at the inquest was to the effect that Nagamani Thevi had informed"
"her that Kandasamy and Mohan had beaten him up and had run along that lane."
