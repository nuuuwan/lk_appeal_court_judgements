"been arrested for the instant matter after 06 months from the complaint."
"The State Counsel appearing for the Respondents objected for bail being granted and"
"stated that the police took six months to file charges because the accused had been"
"absconding."
"Having  considered  the  submissions  of  both  parties,  this  Court  is  mindful  of  the  fact"
"that the purpose of the instant act is to safeguard the rights of Victims of Witnesses"
"but  in  the  same  act  it  is  stated  that  matters  filed  under  this  act  should  be  given"
"precedence, which is to safeguard the rights of all parties."
"In  the  instant  matter  Court  observes  that  the  alleged  act  of  threat  had  taken  place"
"when  the  evidence  of  the  victim  in  the  substantive  matter  was  nearing  conclusion,"
"and as such as it is by now obviously the evidence of the victim should be concluded"
"and as such it is the opinion of this Court that the accused should be enlarged on bail,"
"hence the Accused namely Abdul Sather FowzulAhmed is enlarged on the following"
"conditions of bail."
