"5.  He  has 
later  got 
to  know 
that 
the  deceased  had  died.  The"
"deceased’s  son,  Ajith  (PW6)  upon  seeing 
the  phone  with 
the"
"witness, has asked from where he got the phone, stating that it is"
"the deceased’s phone. He had told Ajith that he got the phone from"
"the appellant. Then Ajith has started crying stating that this is his"
"father’s phone."
"6.  Although 
six  grounds  of  appeal  were  urged 
in 
the  written"
"submissions,  the  main  ground  of  appeal  pursued  at  the  argument"
"by the learned Counsel for the appellant was that the prosecution"
"has  failed  to  establish  the  time  of  death  (ground  no.1).  All  the"
"grounds of appeal will be considered together."
"7. 
It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the"
"prosecution has failed to prove the time the deceased died. As this"
"case 
is  based  on  circumstantial  evidence, 
the 
learned  Counsel"
"submitted  that  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  prove  that  it  was  the"
"appellant who caused the death of the deceased."
"8.  The  medical  officer  (PW12)  who  conducted  the  autopsy  on  the"
"body of the deceased has clearly stated that the cause of death was"
"strangulation. The medical officer has observed about ten injuries,"
"out  of  which  five  injuries  (injuries  no.  2,  7,  8,  9,  10)  have  been"
"caused  before  the death.  The  rest  of the  injuries  had  been  due  to"
"various insect bites after death. The medical officer has conducted"
"the  post-mortem  on  the  body  of  the  deceased  on  25th  May  2010."
"The body has been brought to the mortuary on the 24th afternoon."
"It  was  the  evidence  of  the  medical  officer  that  the  death  has"
"occurred about 18 hours before the body was put into the freezer."
"Hence,  the  death  has  been  caused  in  the  morning  of  23rd  May"
"2010.    In  cross-examination,  the  medical  officer  said  that  this"
"opinion is not only based on scientific methods, but also on other"
"circumstances.  In  that,  he  said  that  the  son  of  the  deceased  has"
"seen the deceased on 23rd morning by 8.30 and that was also taken"
"into consideration when deciding the time of the death. Expressing"
"his  opinion  on  the  time  of  death,  the  medical  officer  said  the"
"following; (page 157)"
