"In a later development, the Board of SJGH took a decision on 31.07.2020 at the 441st Board"
"meeting (minutes are marked as ‘P19’) to suspend the post of ‘Staff Assistant’. Thereafter, at"
"the 442nd meeting held on 27.08.2020 (minutes are marked as ‘P20’), the Board has decided"
"to strictly adhere to the decision of the 441st meeting and to revert the ‘Staff Assistant’ post"
"back to the post of ‘Management Assistant’. On 10.09.2020 through letter marked ‘P21’, the"
"2nd Respondent has communicated the decision taken at the 442nd meeting to the Petitioner."
"As a result, the Board has taken a decision at the 443rd meeting on 24.09.2020 (minutes are"
"marked as ‘P23(a)’) to change the salary step of the Petitioner from MN 3 category to MN 2"
"category and such was made aware to the Petitioner by the 2nd Respondent by letter dated"
"23.10.2020  marked  ‘P23(b)’.  The  issues  raised  by  the  Petitioner  in  the  instant  application"
"emanates from the said decision in ‘P23(a)’."
"In light of the above, the main grievance of the Petitioner is that the said decision taken by"
"the members of the Board on 24.09.2020 affected the salary drawn by her over a period of"
"two  years  and  as  a  consequence,  she  has  been  placed  on  a  lower  salary  scale.  Petitioner’s"
"contention is that such decision of the Board is violative of her legitimate expectation and is"
"baseless/irrational/unreasonable/illegal/ultra vires."
"At this stage, it is necessary to ascertain whether adequate reasons have been given by the"
"Board to reduce the salary of the Petitioner and if so, what those reasons are. The only reason"
"which appears in the minutes of the 443rd meeting (‘P23(a)’) in its particular paragraph under"
"the heading “Reporting irregular appointments at SJGH – vide item 442:02.3” is as follows;"
