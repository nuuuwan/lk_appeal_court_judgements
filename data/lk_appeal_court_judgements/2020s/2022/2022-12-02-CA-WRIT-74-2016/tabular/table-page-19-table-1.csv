"illegal or the said process does not attract the allegation of following an irregular procedure."
"While disagreeing with the said submissions this Court observes that there is leverage given to"
"the planning committee to relax some of the regulations subject to what is stated in 17(3).  It is"
"pertinent  to  observe  that  the  planning  committee  can  only  utilize  this  provision  to  vary"
"requirements, if only the development fulfills the other requirements that are stipulated in the"
"said regulations.  And that too the discretion is given to the planning committee only to vary"
"regulations  pertaining  to  the  square  area  and  the  width  of  the  land  parcel.  It  does  not  give"
"unlimited freedom for the planning committee to vary and disregard the provisions contained"
"in the building Regulations"
"The Respondentâ€™s objections"
"4th,5th  &  6th  Respondents  relying  on  civil  Service  Union  Vs  Minister  for  the  Civil  Service"
"(GCHQ case 3AER 935) contended that the Petitioners have failed to demonstrate the existence"
"of any ground for the grant of a writ, namely grounds for illegality, irrationality, and procedural"
"impropriety in the decision the planning committee had taken."
"In considering all the facts and the materials submitted we are not inclined to agree with the"
"said objections.  As demonstrated above in the judgment we find the 4th 5th and 6th Respondents"
"have clearly violated and misinterpreted and misapplied the regulations for the benefit of the"
"developer who made the application to develop lots 78 and 80. The said application has been"
"submitted on the basis of an amendment.  As submitted by the Petitioner this Court agrees that"
"the said development application should have been rejected when it was tendered, as the said"
"application is not a proper application in the sense that the particulars furnished contradict each"
