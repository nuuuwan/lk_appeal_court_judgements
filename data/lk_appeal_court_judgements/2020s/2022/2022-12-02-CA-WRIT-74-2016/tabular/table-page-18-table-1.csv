"The Regulation marked as P30, 4th part defines what the building line and the street lines are."
"All the parties were not at variance on the fact that there should be 15 m reservations for the"
"building line. It is common ground that the building application submitted for approval depicts"
"only a 12m distance out of the required 15m building line.  To overcome this the 4th,5th & 6th"
"Respondents had considered the ground floor as an existing building. In these circumstances,"
"it was the contention of the Respondents that there was no encroachment on the building line."
"However, the 4th,5th & 6th Respondents submitted that in order to come to this decision they"
"considered the application as an application to renovate/amend an existing building. Thus, they"
"had allowed the requirement to be waived off for the ground floor. But insisted on maintaining"
"the  said  line  for  the  1st  floor.    However,  as  per  the  photographic  evidence  that  has  been"
"submitted to this Court all parties were not in dispute on the fact that the construction depicted"
"in the said photographs is in violation of this requirement and the approval granted."
