"The 1st Party-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants too preferred an appeal bearing No. CA PHC"
"51A/2015, and sought an order to restore them to the land in which the Appellants were in"
"possession."
"I
t is to be observed that the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellant in appeal No."
"CA (PHC) 51/2015 and 2nd Party Respondent-Respondent in appeal No. CA (PHC) 51A/2015"
"had not taken any interest  in participating in these appeals and after issuing notices on"
"several occasions thus Court fixed both appeals to hear in the absence of the said Appellant"
"in appeal No.  CA (PHC) 51/2015 and 2nd Party  Respondent-Respondent in appeal No.  CA"
"(PHC) 51A/2015."
"H
owever, it is seen that the 2nd Party 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellant in appeal No."
"CA (PHC) 51/2015 had not paid brief fees after issuing notices on several occasions, thus"

"made against the order made by the leaned Magistrate but to consider an appeal in which"
"an Order pronounced by the Provincial High Court of Ampara dated 05.05.2015 exercising"
"its revisionary jurisdiction is sought to be called in question."
"N
evertheless, it is imperative to note that the Order on 05.06.2014 made by the learned"
"Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge is a provisional order. As such, the"
"rights of the parties have to be adjudicated by invoking civil jurisdiction of a competent"
"Court."
"I
t is apparent that the intention of the Legislature in introducing Part VII of the Primary"
"Courtsâ€™ Procedure Act No.44 of 1979 is to prevent a breach of the peace and not to go on"
