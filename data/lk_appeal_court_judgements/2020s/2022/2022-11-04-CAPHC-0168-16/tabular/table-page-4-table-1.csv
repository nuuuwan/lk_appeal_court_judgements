"The Respondents had argued that the Vice-Chairman has no authority to give permission. Within"
"the Predeshiya Sabha Limits, one can construct  only on a valid Development  permit  under the"
"provisions  of  the  Urban  Development  Authority  Act.  The  Vice-Chairman  gave  the  letter  of"
"permission, which violates the rules and regulations of the Pradshiya Sabha."
"G
azette  Extraordinary  No.87/7,  dated  18.04.1980,  declared  the  area  in  question  as  an  Urban"
"Development Area. Once it is gazetted, the area comes under the Urban Development Authority"
"Act, and the letter given in the year 2000 becomes invalid. The case was filed in the Magistrate's"
"Court under Section 28(A)(3) of the Urban Development Area Act."
"T
herefore, the duty of the Appellant was to prove that he had obtained a valid development permit,"
"not a letter by an officer of the Pradeshiya Sabha, the only way to satisfy the Magistrate that the"
"Appellant's building was a lawful construction."
"W
hen considering the above position, we see no exceptional grounds that the learned High Court"
"Judge could have considered. As the Respondent pointed out, two Petition of Appeals is filed in"
"the brief."
"O
n  09.11.2016,  Attorney-at-Law  Susantha  Rathnayaka  filed  one  appeal,  and  Attorney-at-Law"
"R.M.  Gunathilake  filed  the  2nd  Petition  of  appeal  without  a  date  but  November  2016.  The"
"Appellant cannot be careless. However, perusing both Petitions, they look similar."
"T
herefore,  whichever  is  considered,  the  prayers  and  pleadings  are  the  same.  A  perusal  of  the"
"Magistrate's  Court's  record  indicated  that  the  Appellant  had  only  requested  to  settle  with  the"
"authorities and not given any explanation or argument regarding his rights. He had never argued"
"regarding the maintainability of the action filed against him. Therefore, the learned High Court"
"Judge observed that the Appellant had not taken any arguments raised before the High Court or at"
"the Magistrate Court."
