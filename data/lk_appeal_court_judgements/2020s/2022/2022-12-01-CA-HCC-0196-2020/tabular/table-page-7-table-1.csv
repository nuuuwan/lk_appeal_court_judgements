"23/08/2018  and  marked  the  receipt  as  P10  in  the  trial.  The  defence  had"
"cross  examined  all  the  witnesses  who  took  charge  of  the  production  but"
"could  not  raise  any  doubt  on  their  evidence.  Further,  the  defence  had"
"admitted  the  Government  Analyst  Report  as  an  admission  and  marked  it"
"without calling the Government Analyst in the trial. The Government Analyst"
"confirmed in his report that he received the production in a sealed envelope."
"Hence no adverse evidence had been led on the production which had been"
"sent  to  Government  Analyst  Department.  I  conclude  that  the  learned  trial"
"Judge has considered the evidence with regard to the chain of custody in its"
"correct perspective. Hence this ground of appeal also sans any merit."
"As  the  Learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  had  not  contested  the  fourth"
"ground of appeal, now I consider the final ground of appeal hereafter. In his"
"final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the prosecution had led"
"bad character evidence during the trial."
"But on perusal of the entire court record and the judgment nowhere found"
"any evidence of bad character in nature had creeped into the proceedings."
"The Learned Trial Judge nowhere put question from bench to impeach the"
"character of the Appellant. The Learned Trial Judge after considering all the"
"evidence  presented  by  both  parties  had  come  to  a  decision  to  accept  the"
"prosecution version  as credible  and rejected the defence case. Hence, it is"
"not true that bad character evidence had creeped into the court proceedings."
"Therefore, this ground of appeal also has no merit."
"In  every  criminal  case  the  burden  is  on  the  prosecution  to  prove  the  case"
"beyond  reasonable  doubt  against  the  accused  person.  In  a  case  of  this"
"nature, the prosecution needs to not only prove the case beyond reasonable"
"doubt  with  cogent  and  believable  evidence  sans  any  contradictions  or"
"omissions but  should also ensure  that the arrest, detection, weighing  and"
"sending  the  substance  for  analysis  is  conducted  with  accordance  to  due"
"process which will otherwise affect the root of the case."
