"unlikely that  he  would want to  create  another witness by  requesting that  person  also  to"
"come. Under normal circumstances he had borrowed the three-wheeler without the owner,"
"because he can drive. So, because of that, that item of evidence, I cannot rely on hear, to"
"reinforce the case for the prosecution.”"
"There  was  another  controversy  with  regard  to  the  stone.  It  is  a  fact  that  at  the  time  of"
"recovery of the body in the presence of the Magistrate. According to the police the dead"
"body was tied to a stone or a rock which was covered in another bag, tied with a particular"
"type of a rope. There is an issue with regard to the identification of that object because one"
"of the police officers who was involved with the recovery of that object has testified in Court"
"to the effect that what was recovered was a rock or a stone which weigh about 15kgs. There"
"again, no evidence is available with regard to how it was measured. Did he just lift it up? It"
"is guesswork or there is no evidence of any weighing scale being used. He has said “කිල ෝ"
"15ක් පමණ""."
"“Then what happened was, when the item seemed to have been taken into police custody"
"when that was produced at the police station, the police officer reserved had stated that it"
"was  about  1  kg  in  weight.  I  think  that  was  what  was  referred  to  by  my  learned  friend,"
"President’s Counsel for the 1st Accused. So how did this 15 kg stone yet reduced to 1 kg. To"
"make matters worse, at the trial the prosecutor had attempted to mark this particular object"
"as a production and the police officer who recovered it testify to the effect that this is not"
"the stone I recovered. Therefore, I cannot identify this, So, that item of evidence also is of"
"no value to us.”"
"“Then there was another issue. One of the police officers in the process of inspecting the"
"residence  of  the  accused  had  observed  that  there  was  one  paving  stone  missing  from  a"
"particular pathway in the compound of the 1st and 2nd accused-appellants, I believe it leads"
"to a toilet. Then he got the right idea of comparing the stone which supposed to have been"
"recovered from the dead body by process of superimposition physically bring it to the house"
"of the accused and place it there in order to see whether the edges of that stone would tally"
"or match that empty space. Then he says he did that and it was according to him a perfect"
"match. But unfortunately, I do not know whether I can rely on such an experiment. It ought"
"to  have  been  done  by  Government  Analyst  who  would  have  conducted  a  scientific"
"experiment. So, my lords, I am not in a position to rely on that of evidence as well. Primarily,"
"due to the reason that there is a doubt as to what was recovered which is a 15kg stone or 1"
"kg stone.”"
"“Then, my lords, we come to the other aspects, the identification of the dead body.  On that"
"score, I am at variance with the views expressed by my learned friends. I think my learned"
"friends relied primarily on the items of clothing worn by the deceased because the PW 2"
"says, when I last saw my mother, she was attired in this particular item of garment, a pink"
"colour  frock  with  a  floral  design  on  it.  But  what  was  recovered  is  two  items  of  garment"
"according to police. Firstly, reddish top according to one police witness and a blue colour"
"denim skirt. The red colour top was shown to the witness PW 2, that is the daughter but I"
"found  unfortunately  the  blue  colour  denim  skirt  which  was  marked  as  P10,  if  I  am  not"
"mistaken was not shown to PW 2.  Be that as it may, my respectful submission is that it is"
"very clear when one leads the evidence of PW 2 that she identified the dead body not with"
