"instant application deals with a conviction of statutory rape where a term"
"of  fifteen-year  Rigorous  Imprisonment  has  been  imposed  by  the  High"
"Court. Within such a context, it is incumbent upon this Court to determine"
"whether 
the 
circumstances  averred  by 
the  petitioner 
satisfactorily"
"dispense the threshold of exceptionality required."
"The exceptional circumstances averred by the petitioner are contained in"
"paragraph 7 of the petition. They are succinctly that there is a reasonable"
"prospect of  petitioner’s main appeal being allowed and as such,  the delay"
"in hearing petitioner’s appeal will render any judgment in his favour futile;"
"suicidal  thoughts  and  mental  instability  of  petitioner’s  child;  petitioner"
"being the sole breadwinner of the family; and his businesses and employs"
"being  negatively 
impacted  by  his 
imprisonment;  the  petitioner  being"
"present  at  Court  on  all  dates  of  trial  and  will  not  abscond;  and  the"
"petitioner  being  more  susceptible  to  COVID-19  when  at  prison.  These"
"grounds  were  similar  to  the  grounds  raised  before  the  High  Court  (Vide"
"page 61 of the Brief). Whilst the said grounds were averred in the petition"
"of  the 
instant  application,  the  same  were  not  relied  on  during  oral"
"submissions. The learned President’s Counsel representing the petitioner"
"confined his submissions to the admissibility of a video recorded evidence"
"of the child prosecutrix as envisioned by Section 163A and Section 163A"
"(5) of the Evidence Ordinance as amended by Act No. 32 of 1999. However,"
"as held by Sulaiman Lebbe Case (supra), these are matters forming the"
"crux of the appeal filed by the petitioner and are to be determined by the"
"Court  sitting 
in  appeal.  Hence,  this  Court  will  refrain 
from  passing"
"judgment on the material facts pertinent to the conviction and sentence of"
"the  petitioner  and  will  limit  its  determination  on  whether  the  impugned"
"order of the High Court dated 06.01.2021 is illegal or irregular to the extent"
"of shocking the conscience of this Court."
"In the impugned order the learned High Court judge carefully analyses the"
"submission on the health condition of the petitioner’s child and holds the"
"CPA-32-21                                                                                                                                  Page 5 of 8"
