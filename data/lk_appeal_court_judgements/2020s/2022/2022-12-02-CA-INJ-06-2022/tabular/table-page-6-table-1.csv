"on request and further, submits that also, under clauses 8.4 and 8.5 he is entitled to an extension."
"However, we find that under clause 19.1 for the contractor to seek an extension pursuant to the"
"said clause he should give notice to the engineer.   The Petitioner has failed to submit to this"
"court any document to demonstrate that he has complied with the said clause and given the"
"notice to the engineer seeking an extension."
"In  anticipation  of  him  not  getting  the  requested  extension  from  the  employer  and  in  his"
"apprehension that the Ministry  is going to encash the performance guarantee, he  has sought"
"injunctive relief from this Court.  He further submits that he is seeking this relief until he files"
"a Civil action against the Respondent Ministry before the commercial High Court and District"
"Court of Colombo."
"In considering this application it is pertinent to note that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate"
"to this Court with any substantive material his apprehension, that the performance guarantee"
"furnished is going to be encashed. what is pleaded is his belief which is not substantiated by"
"any  material.   It  is  also  pertinent to  note that the petitioner  on  previous  occasions  had  been"
"given several extensions to complete the construction which he has failed to do."
"In essence, by this application, the petitioner is seeking relief pertaining to a matter where his"
"relationship with the Respondent is based on a contract. It is not denied by the petitioner that"
"the breach of the contract would result in an actionable wrong which has a remedy provided by"
"the contract itself."
"In any event, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate to this court that he has complied with"
"the contractual requirements to obtain an extension that would have been available to him under"
"P2."
