"child against the petitioner. The petitioner has appealed to the Board of Quazis,"
"which vacated the said order and directed an inquiry de novo."
"In   the   subsequent   inquiry   the   02nd  respondent   Quazi   has   by   order   dated"
"16.09.2017 has ordered to pay Rs. 12,000/- monthly for the 01st  respondent"
"and Rs. 10,000/- monthly for the child."
"The petitioner has again preferred an appeal to the Board of Quazis. But this"
"fact was not known to the 02nd respondent who issued notice on the petitioner"
"and   thereafter   an   enforcement   order   which   he   directed   to   the   Magistrate’s"
"Court.   In   the   Magistrate’s   Court   the   petitioner   has   paid   the   arrears   of"
"maintenance."
"The   petitioner   in   this   application   seeks   a   writ   of   certiorari   to   quash   the"
"enforcement order of the 02nd respondent."
"But it is admitted that although the petitioner has filed a motion before the"
"Board of Quazis to issue an interim order against the 02nd  respondent it has"
"never been supported."
"The 02nd  respondent therefore did not have any impediment against exercising"
"his   jurisdiction   under   section   64(1)   of   Part   VIII   of   Muslim   Marriages   and"
"Divorce Act."
"Hence there is no reason to issue a writ of certiorari in this application. The"
"application is dismissed."
