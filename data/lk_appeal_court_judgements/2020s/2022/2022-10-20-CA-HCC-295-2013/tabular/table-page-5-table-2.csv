"The grounds of appeal urged by the appellant are as follows:",""
"1.","The  indictment  was  amended  after  two  witnesses  had  completed  their"
"","evidence.  The amendment was not read out to the appellant, nor it was"
"","handed  over  to  her.    This  is  an  imperative  provision  as  per  the  Code  of"
"","Criminal  Procedure  Act.    Further,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  signed"
"","the  amendment  in  the  indictment.  That  is  not  a  function  of  the  Judge,"
"","and that should have been done by an officer from the Attorney Generalâ€™s"
"","Department."
"2.","The  second  ground  of  appeal  is  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"","failed  to  take  into  account  the  contradictions  of  the  testimonies  of  the"
"","prosecution witnesses  per-se and inter-se."
"3.","The  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  decided  that  the  prosecution  had"
"","proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, before considering the defence"
"","witnesses."
"4.","The  dock  statement  of  the  appellant  was  rejected  without  adequately"
"","evaluating it."
