"","n  case  of  Shankarlal  Gyarasilal  Dixit  V.  State  of  Maharashtra  [1981]  Cri."
"L.J 325Indian Supreme Court held;",""
"“In  a  case  of  circumstantial  evidence,","the  circumstances  on"
"","which the prosecution relies must be consistent with the sole hypothesis"
"","of  the  guilt  of  the  accused.  It  is  not  to  be  expected  that  in  every  case"
"","depending  on  circumstantial  evidence,  the  whole  of  the  law  governing"
"","cases  of  circumstantial  evidence  should  be  set  out  in  the  judgment."
"","Legal  principles  are  not  magic  incantations  and  their  importance  lies"
"","more in their application  to a given  set  of facts  than in  their recital in"
"","the  judgment.  The  simple  expectation  is  that  the  judgment  must  show"
"","that  the  finding  of  guilt,  if  any,  has  been  reached  after  a  proper  and"
"","careful evaluation of circumstances in order to determine whether they"
"are compatible with any other reasonable hypothesis.”",""
