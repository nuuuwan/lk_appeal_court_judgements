"The  appellant  did  not  challenge  the  weight  confirmed  by  the  Government"
"Analyst.  There  can  be  minute  differences  in  the  weight  depending  on  the"
"equipment and atmospherical conditions. The Government Analyst’s labs must"
"have  more  sophisticated  equipment  and  conditions 
to  weigh  production"
"accurately. There is no substantial difference in the weight in the circumstance"
"of this case."
"The  next  argument  is  regarding  the  4.0km  difference  in  mileage  of  the  two"
"vehicles  used  for  the  raid.  The  police  had  covered  more  than  60.0km  on  that"
"day as per the odometer. One vehicle indicates that they have covered 64.0km,"
"and the other shows 68.0km. The learned Judge has considered this difference"
"and  come  to  the  conclusion  that  this  slight  difference 
is  not  a  reason  to"
"disbelieve  otherwise  credible  evidence.  I  see  no  reason  to  disagree  with  this"

"It  was  argued  for  the  appellant  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  not"
"accepted  nor  had  he  rejected  the  dock statement  of  the  appellant  and  he  had"
"not dealt with it as required by law."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  specifically  referred  to  the  dock  statement"
"on  pages  13,  14,  and  15  of  his  judgment.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"specifically considered as to whether the appellant was arrested at his home as"
"stated  in  his  dock  statement.  Further,  he  observed  that  the  appellant  being"
"taken  to  Hokandara  was  not  put  to  any  of  the  prosecution  witnesses.  The"
"learned High Court Judge has clearly stated that the defence evidence did not"
"create a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. In these circumstances, this"
"argument cannot be sustained."
