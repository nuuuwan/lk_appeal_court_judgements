"q
uantity  than  an  average  drug  addict  would  use,  is  a  question  of  fact  and"
"should be proved by evidence."
"Therefore, I believe that the evidence of possession of 2.2 grams of heroin itself"
"is insufficient to prove a charge of trafficking. In the circumstances, I hold that"
"count  one  in  the  indictment  is  not  proved,  and  therefore  sentence  regarding"
"count one is set aside."
"The  conviction  for  the  second  charge  and  the  sentence  imposed  for  that  is"
"affirmed.  However,  I  direct  that  the  sentence  is  deemed  to  have  been  served"
"from the date of the conviction, namely, 2015.10.05."
