"T
he next argument is whether the charge of trafficking is proved. As per section"
"54(  A)  of 
the  Ordinance,“traffic”  means 
(a) 
to  sell,  give,  procure,  store,"
"administer,  transport,  send,  deliver  or  distribute  or  (b)  to  offer  to  do  anything"
"mentioned in paragraph (a)."
"In  the  case  of  Hon.  Attorney  General  vs  Mohomed 
Iqbal  Mohomed  Sadath"
"decided 
on

SC/SPL/LA/58/15

Appeal

"Buwaneka  Aluwihare  stated  as 
follows, 
in  paragraphs  41  and  42  of 
the"
"judgment;"
"“41…The offence of drug trafficking, however, also requires that the prosecution"
"establish  that  the  perpetrator  was  involved  in  the  selling,  procuring,  storing,"
"administering, 
transporting,  delivering  or  distributing  of  such  drugs,  or  had"
"offered to do anything referred to above [Definition of the term “traffic” in section"
"54  A  of 
the  Ordinance]. 
It 
is 
this  additional 
requirement 
[of  an  act] 
that"
"transforms the status of the offence [of possession] to trafficking."
"42.  Since  possession  and 
trafficking 
can 
look 
the  same  at 
first  glance,"
"prosecution 
for 
drug 
trafficking 
typically 
requires 
producing 
additional"
"circumstantial evidence to indicate that the Accused was in possession of drugs"
"not  for  personal  use  but  for  commercial  purposes.  The  quantity  of  the  drug"
"detected  would  be  a  good  indicator  to  decide  whether  the  perpetrator  is  a  user"
"[an  addict]  or  is  trading  in  drugs.  This  would  be  a  question  of  fact.  It  is  in  this"
"context,  it  was  stated  at  the  commencement  of  this  judgement  that  the  4th"
"question  of  law  raised  by  the  State,  on  which  special  leave  was  granted,  does"
"not contain a question of law; thus, this court will not endeavour to answer that"
"question.”"
"In the instant case, the prosecution did not produce additional circumstantial"
"evidence, or witness testimony to indicate that the appellant was in possession"
"of  drugs,  not  for  his  personal  use  but  for  commercial  purposes.  Whether  the"
"possession  of  2.2  grams  of  heroin 
itself  could  be  considered  as  a  higher"
