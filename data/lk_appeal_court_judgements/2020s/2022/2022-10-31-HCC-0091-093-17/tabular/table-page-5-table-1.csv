"'Appreciation of evidence, the approach must be whether the evidence of the witness read"
"as a whole, appears to have a ring of truth. Once that impression is formed, the Court should"
"scrutinize the evidence keeping in view the deficiencies, drawbacks and infirmities pointed"
"out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general"
"tenor  of  the  evidence  given  by  him  and  whether  the  earlier  evaluation  of  the  evidence  is"
"shaken as to render it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching"
"the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here"
"or there from the evidence attaching importance to some technical error committed by the"
"investigating officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection"
"of the evidence as a whole.'"
"Further guidelines have been set forth in  Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai vs. the State of Gujarat; AIR"
"1983 SC 753 wherein the Indian Supreme Court held as follows:"
"'By and large, a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic memory and to recall"
"the  details  of  an  incident.  It  is  not  as  if  a  video  tape  is  replayed  on  the  mental  screen."
"Ordinarily, it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The Witness could not have"
"anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element of surprise. The mental faculties"
"therefore cannot be expected to be attuned to absorb the details. The powers of observation"
"differ from person to person. What one may notice, another may not. An object or movement"
"might emboss its image on one person's mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of"
"another. Ordinarily, a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence of events"
"which take place in rapid succession or in a short time span. A witness is liable to get confused,"
"or mixed up when interrogated later on.'"
"On the issue of whether the witnesses had failed the test of credibility, criteria that need to"
"be looked into had been set forth as follows in Bhojraj Vs. Sita Ram: (1936) 38 BOMLR 344."
"‘The  real  tests  are: how  consistent  the  story is  with  itself,  how  it  stands  the test  of  cross-"
"examination and how far it fits in with the rest of the evidence and the circumstances of the"
"case.’"
"What  is  meant  by  the  credibility  of  a  witness  had  been  closely  examined  by  the  Court  of"
"Appeal in Ontario, Canada, in R Vs. Morrissey; (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514, 80 O.A.C. 161 (Ont."
"C.A.) in which it was held thus,"
"'Testimonial  evidence  can  raise  veracity  and  accuracy  concerns.  The  former  relates  to  the"
"witness's sincerity, that is, his or her willingness to speak the truth as the witness believes it"
"to  be.  The  latter  concerns  relate  to  the  actual  accuracy  of  the  witness's  testimony.  The"
"accuracy of a witness's testimony involves considerations of the witness's ability to accurately"
"observe,  recall  and  recount  the  events  in  issue.  When  one  is  concerned  with  a  witness's"
"veracity, one speaks of the witness's credibility. When one is concerned with the accuracy of"
"a  witness’s  testimony,  one  speaks  of  the  reliability  of  that  testimony.  A  witness  whose"
"evidence on a point is not credible cannot give reliable evidence on that point...'"
