"‘the existence of common intention said to have been shared by the accused is, on an"
"ultimate analysis, a question of fact.’"
"At this stage, it is indisputable that the version of the said PW8 was not corroborated by any"
"of the other police witnesses or eyewitnesses despite the fact that there was a large number"
"of persons including police men and civilians present at the place of the incident. The third"
"accused-appellant  neither  had been  arrested  along  with the  first  and  the  second  accused-"
"appellants nor had there been clear-cut evidence to support the fact that the first and the"
"second  accused-appellants  had  been  taken 
into  custody  together  at  the  crime  scene."
"Although 
the 
third  accused-appellant  had  been 
identified  by  eye  witnesses  at 
the"
"identification parade as the person who pointed a gun at them, the prosecution had failed to"
"establish that he had been in possession of the said weapon thus, the link between the third"
"accused-appellant and the pistol had not been properly formed. None of the lay witnesses"
"was able to identify the first and the second accused-appellants at the dock other than the"
"police  witnesses  and

"identification  parade.  With  these  unresolved  pieces  of  evidence  in  the  background,  it  is"
"absurd to hold that the first two accused-appellants had shared a common intention with the"
"third accused-appellant."
"It  has  been  submitted  on  behalf  of  the  third  accused-appellant  that  the  said  accused-"
"appellants had been wrongly convicted under section 44A of the Firearms (Amendment) Act"
"since there had been no evidence to prove that he had used a firearm and that mere pointing"
"of  a  firearm  is  not  sufficient  to  secure  a  conviction  under  the  said  section.  Firstly,  the"
"prosecution had failed to prove that the accused-appellant had exclusive possession over the"
"pistol since the evidence that had been relied upon to prove the same had been the testimony"
"of  PW  8  which 
is  flawed.  Secondly,  even 
if  the  third  accused-appellant  had  exclusive"
"possession  over  the  said  firearm,  the  fact  that  he  had  used  the  firearm  should  have  been"
"proved in order to support a conviction under the aforesaid section. Furthermore, it needs to"
