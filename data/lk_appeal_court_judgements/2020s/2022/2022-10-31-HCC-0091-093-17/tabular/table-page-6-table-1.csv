pplying the law to the facts of this matter at hand, it is obvious that neither the first nor the"
"second accused-appellant could be linked to the offences mentioned above since none of the"
"lay  eyewitnesses  (albeit  the  police  officers)  had  been  able  to  recall  with  precision  as  to"
"whether  both  the  accused-appellants  had  been  arrested  at  the  crime  scene.  Such  a"
"discrepancy undoubtedly shakes up the core of the case of the prosecution and casts doubt"
"upon the culpability of the said accused-appellants."
"The next ground of appeal is related to the absence of any recovery in relation to the crimes"
"committed. The prosecution not only had failed to produce any of the items alleged to have"
"been robbed by the said accused-appellants but also had failed to lead evidence to establish"
"that the said accused-appellants had been in possession of any of the said productions at the"
"time of their arrest. No evidence had been led regarding the value of the jewelry and money"
"that was robbed. According to the indictment it had been stated that the value of all that had"
"been robbed was Rs. 578,300/- but, the prosecution had failed to prove the amount through"
"evidence. Owing to this, it is apparent that the elements of the offence of robbery had not"
"been established by the prosecution in order to secure the conviction under section 380 of"
"the Penal Code since this charge under robbery requires proof of theft in this instance. Thus,"
"failure on the part of the prosecution to specify, identify and reveal the subject matter of the"
"alleged robbery yet again put the case of the prosecution at stake."
