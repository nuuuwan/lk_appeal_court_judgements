"The Respondents vehemently contest this document and claim that the said document is not"
"the official minutes of the Wages Board and accordingly has marked the respective minutes"
"of the Wages Board as 2R1 and 2R2.  I find that the other Respondents too have filed these"
"proceedings with different markings 3R7, 10R3, and 10R4. The 2R1 document is pertaining"
"to the minutes of the Wages Board of the Tea industry and 2R2 is for the Rubber industry. As"
"per the said 2R2 document what is demonstrated is that the Chairman of the Wages Board"
"had made a PowerPoint presentation pertaining to considerations that should be taken into"
"account in discussing the minimum wages. I also find in the document relating to the tea"
"industry, that the Wages Board has considered the plight of small holdings  and has also"
"considered the cost of living where workers’ representatives had submitted a figure of Rs"
"65,000. I find that none of these facts are reflected in the document marked P9. The said P9"
"document had been signed by an employers’ representative while the corresponding Wages"
"Board minutes for the same day marked as 2R2 by the 2nd Respondent is signed by the Wages"
"Board’s Secretary. I observe that the contents of the two documents differ. The Petitioners"
"have   failed   to   submit   the   certified   copies   of   the   minutes   of   the   Wages   Board   meeting"
"pertaining to the tea industry although they are seeking to quash the decision that has been"
"proposed   at   this   meeting.   The   Respondents   strenuously   argued   that   by   submitting   the"
"document P9, which was not the official minutes of the Wages Board the Petitioners have"
"attempted to suppress true facts and mislead and misrepresented facts to the Court.  Further, it"
"was submitted that what the Petitioners had pleaded as a true copy of the minutes, are in fact"
"not the official minutes and a description of the events that took place on 08/02/2021. Instead"
"it was a minute prepared by one  Mr. Prasad De Silva."
"In response, the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioners contends in his submission,"
"that the said minutes were taken by a member of the Rubber Wages Board who was an"
"employer’s representative and contends that there were no such minutes maintained for the"
"Wages Board for tea. They contended that the official minutes were not available at the time"
"of filing this case and thus the Petitioners submitted document P9."
"When the Petitioners submitted P9, the Petitioners failed to disclose that the official minutes"
"pertaining to the Wages Board meeting for the Rubber trade was not available to them and"
"therefore, they were annexing a minute of what took place as taken down by an employers’"
"representative, and I also find that the Petitioners have failed to disclose the discrepancies of"
"the official version and the minutes in P9.  The Petitioners further contended that when the"
"document P9 was filed prior to support and when the limited objections were filed by the"
"Respondents, they had not objected to the document P9. I do not agree with this contention as"
"well. Whether the Respondents in their limited objections pertaining to the issuance of the"
"stay order objected to this document or not, the Petitioners are duty-bound to disclose true"
"facts."
"Our Courts have throughout held that a Petitioner who seeks an equitable remedy is obliged"
"to come with clean hands and not misrepresent facts to Court however trivial they may think"
"the misrepresentation is. In my view, document P9 is very much relevant to the issue at hand"
