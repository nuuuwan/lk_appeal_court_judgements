"discretionary jurisdiction of a Court of law is found wanting in the discharge of its duty to"
"disclose all material facts, or is shown to have attempted to pollute the pure stream of"
"justice, the Court not only has the right but a duty to deny relief to such person."
"Don   Mary  Roshani  Vs.  Sri  Lanka  Medical   Council   and  others  CA   (Writ)  234/2017"
"decided on 26/05/2020,  “It is established law that discretionary relief will be refused by"
"Court without going into the merits if there has been suppression and/or misrepresentation"
"of material facts”."
"Even   though   this   Court   has   upheld   the   objections   raised   by   the   Respondents   and   this"
"application  has  to fail, for completeness, I will now  consider the main  arguments  of the"
"Petitioners."
"The   Petitioners’   main   contention   before   us   was   that   the   decision   on   P12   is   completely"
"arbitrary and purely based on political consideration."
"As   discussed   above,   considering   the   history   of   the   minimum   wage   increase   and   as   the"
"impugned decision to raise the minimum wage to Rs 1000 was proposed subsequent to a"
"vote, we are unable to hold with the Petitioners on this ground."
"Even though the Petitioners contended that the decision contained in P12 is ultra vires, I take"
"the view that the Petitioners have failed to substantiate the said submission, and I observe that"
"the Respondents have demonstrated that the said decision had been arrived at by the Wages"
"Board   pursuant   to   the   provisions   of   the   Wages   Board  Ordinance   and  after   the   proposed"
"decisions had been put to vote."
"The Petitioners’ other argument is the aforesaid decision was unreasonable and irrational as it"
"had failed to take into account important and relevant considerations, namely, the minimum"
"wage of other industries, and prevailing inflation rates to determine the need for an increase,"
"etc. The Petitioners’ prime complaint was pertaining to the tea industry, and to determine this"
"contention, the best evidence would have been the minutes of the Wages Board on the tea"
"trade. However, the Petitioners had failed to submit to this Court the relevant minutes of the"
"Wages Board on the tea trade. The said minutes as stated elsewhere in this judgment, were"
"submitted by the Respondents. The said minutes demonstrate that most of the Petitioners’"
"concerns   had   been   considered   by   the   Wages   Board.   It   was   the   duty   of   the   employers’"
"representatives to raise any issue that had to be given due consideration. As per the minutes"
"marked as 3R7, the employers’ representative too had been present at the said Wages Board"
"meeting and had taken part in the deliberations."
"The minutes of the subsequent date tendered to this Court by the Respondents, reflect that the"
"employers’ representatives had seconded the minutes to be correct. If there were material"
"facts   that   the   Wages   Board   should   have   considered   or   had   failed   to   consider,   then   the"
"employers’ representatives were at liberty to raise them and draw the attention of the Wages"
"Board to the said considerations. After all, in my view, the employers’ representatives are"
