"Once such boards are established, they will determine interalia the minimum rate of wages"
"for the workers.     The said Wages Board will have an equal number of representatives on"
"behalf of the employers and an equal number of representatives on behalf of the employees"
"and the Minister has the power to appoint nominated members to the Wages Board subject to"
"section 9 of the Wages Board Ordinance.  The Wages Board will convene and decide on the"
"proposal submitted, in this instance, it is the minimum wages for a particular trade (that is tea"
"and rubber) in consultation with the representatives of the employers and the employees who"
"will be members of the said Board."
"It is observed as submitted by the Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Respondents, that the legislature"
"in its wisdom has made provisions to establish the Wages Board to constitute “a tripartite"
"statutory body that enables a consideration of the worker’s rights, employer’s concerns and"
"the policy of the government and who is bound to strike an equitable balance between the"
"competing interest”   thus, it’s clear that the deliberations of the Wages Board have to be on a"
"consultative and compromise basis which would be for the best interest of all stakeholders"
"and decisions arrived pursuant to the provisions of the Wages Board Ordinance and make a"
"determination."
"However, it  is  essential  for this  Court  to primarily  consider  the  objections  raised by the"
"Respondents   pertaining   to   the   maintainability   of  this   action.   We   find   that   almost   all   the"
"Respondents   have   taken   up   the   same   objections   pertaining   to   the   maintainability   of   the"
"instant application."
"Whether Necessary parties are before Court"
"Parties are not at variance on the establishment of the Wages Board and the said Board had"
"discussed   a   proposal   to   increase   the   minimum   wages   of   the   workers   to   Rs   900   plus   a"
"budgetary   allowance   of   Rs   100.   It   is   common   ground   that   the   representatives   of   the"
"employers in the Wages Board had objected to the said increase and accordingly a vote had"
"taken place and on the majority decision, the Wages Board approved the proposed minimum"
"wage increase. Thereafter in pursuance of the Wages Board Ordinance, the Chairman of the"
"Wages Board had called for objections. It is also common ground that there had been 179"
"objections."
"The parties are not at variance that the decision of the Wages Board applies to all the regional"
"plantation  companies  and others  including small holdings  involved  in the  tea and rubber"
"sector."
"The   Petitioners   are   basically   challenging   the   decision   taken   by   the   Wages   Board   which"
"constitutes a body of persons. The said impugned decision had been taken by the said body of"
"persons after a vote. The vote was required as there had been a division in the decision. All"
"the Respondents contended that the Petitioners have failed to name all the members of the"
"Wages Board as Respondents. Thus, the contention of the Respondents is that the members"
"who made the decision and whose decision is impugned are not made parties."
