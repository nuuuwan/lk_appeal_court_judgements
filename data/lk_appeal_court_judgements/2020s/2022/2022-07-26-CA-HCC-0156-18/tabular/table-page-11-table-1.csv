"In  the  case  of  Wright  vs.  Nicholson  54  Cr.  App.  R.  38,  it  was  held  that  the"
"prosecution should not be allowed to depart from an allegation that an offence"
"was committed on a particular day in reliance on the principle in Dossi, if there"
"is a risk that the defendant has been misled as to the allegation he has to answer"
"or that he would be prejudiced in having to answer a less specific allegation as"
