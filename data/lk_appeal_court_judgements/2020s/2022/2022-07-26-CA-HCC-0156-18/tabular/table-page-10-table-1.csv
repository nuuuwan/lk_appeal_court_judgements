"omission has misled the accused against the charge/charges preferred against"
"him."
"It  is  very  much  clear  from  the  evidence  placed  before  the  Court  as  correctly"
"viewed by the learned High Court Judge, the victim child has faced sexual abuse"
"over a period of time and on several occasions. She has stated to the principal"
"that  she  had  to  face  such  harassments  on  about  5  occasions.  When  giving"
"evidence before the High Court, she has stated that it was about 8 or 9 occasions."
"She has also stated in her evidence that these incidents happened when she was"
"studying in grade 4 and 5 of the school. According to the evidence of the class"
"teacher and the principal, the child has been studying in  grade 5 when  these"
"incidents of sexual abuse came to light. I find that given the age of the child and"
"the  family  background  of  the  child,  she  has  not  been  able  to  give  a  definite"
"particular date or dates as to the sexual abuse incidents she had to undergo."
"However,  she  has  been  specific  as  to  a  particular  time  period  in  her  evidence"
"which clearly appears to be the reason why the indictment refers to three counts"
"of  grave  sexual  abuse  committed  within  a  period  of  one  year  given,  the  legal"
"restrictions as provided for in section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act."
"At this juncture, I would like to draw my attention to the case of R. vs. Dossi 13"
"Cr. App. R. 158 where this aspect was sufficiently discussed."
