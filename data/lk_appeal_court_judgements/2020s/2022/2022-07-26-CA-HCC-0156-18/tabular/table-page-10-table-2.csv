"Cr. App. R. 158 where this aspect was sufficiently discussed."
"It was held:"
"“That a date specified in an indictment is not a material matter unless"
"it  is  an  essential  part  of  the  alleged  offence;  the  defendant  may  be"
"convicted although the jury finds that the offence was committed on"
"a date other than that specified in the indictment. Amendment of the"
"indictment is unnecessary, although it will be good practice to do so"
"(provided there is no prejudice) where it is clear on the evidence that"
"if the offence as committed at all, it was committed on the day other"
"than that specified.”"
