"O
n a perusal of the record, it appears that the learned Trial Judge erred when he"
"excluded Lots “D” and “E” from the corpus. Those Lots should have formed part of the"

"consist of Lots “A”, “B”, “C”, “F” and “J”. No attempt was made to correct this during the"
"course of giving evidence either. This is a mistake on the Plaintiff’s part, which he admits"
