"dated 11.09.2017, dismissing the application of the Respondent-Petitioner without having issued"
"notices on the Respondents. It  appears that the  Acting  Director General of  Irrigation being the"
"competent authority had made an application in  terms of  Section 5 (1) of Act  No. 07 of 1979,"
"State  Lands  (Recovery  of  Possession)  to  eject  the  Respondent  from  the  land  described  in  the"
"schedule to the application."
"Subsequent to the inquiry, the learned Additional Magistrate had allowed the said application of"
"the Applicant-Respondent and ordered to eject the Respondent-Petitioner and his agents from the"
"land in question. Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent-Petitioner had invoked the"
"revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Anuradhapura."
"It was the contention of the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter sometimes referred to"
"as the Appellant], that the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter sometimes referred to"
"as the Respondent] being the Director General of Irrigation is not a competent authority within"
"the meaning of Section 05 read with Section 28 of the said Act."
"In this respect, the attention of Court was drawn to the case of Muhandiram Vs. Chairman No."
"111,  Janatha  Estates  Development  Board  [1992]  1  SLR  110,  which  held  that  in  terms  of"
"Section  9  (1)  of  the  State  Lands  (Recovery  of  Possession)  Act  No.  07  of  1979  [hereinafter"

"except that such person may establish that he is in possession or in occupation of the land"
