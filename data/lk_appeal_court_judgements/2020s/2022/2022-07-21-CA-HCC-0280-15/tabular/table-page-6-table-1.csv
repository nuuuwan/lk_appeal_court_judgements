"grams of Hashish and arrest of two persons in the Puttalam area for which he"
"has  answered,  stating  since  he  has  conducted  large  number  of  detections  is"
"unable  to  say  anything  without  looking  at  his  notes  in  this  regard.  Questions"
"have been put to the witness which appears to suggest that part of the drugs"
"found in the earlier mentioned detection has been introduced to the appellant"
"which the witness has denied. It was also his evidence that he and the PW-01"
"had to struggle with the appellant before he was arrested."
"In this action, the prosecution has led evidence to prove the chain of custody of"
"the productions as well as the evidence of the Government Analyst to prove the"
"quantity of Heroin sent for their analysis. The Government Analyst in evidence"
"has confirmed that in the parcel marked KP1 and in the parcel marked KP 2, she"
"identified 153.1 grams and 160.4 grams of pure Heroin respectively."
"At the end of the prosecution case, learned High Court Judge, after considering"
"the evidence placed before the Court has decided to call for a defence from the"
"appellant. Accordingly, the appellant has chosen to make an unsworn statement"
"from the dock. It has been his position that the evidence that he was arrested in"
"Mount Lavinia and detained at the S.D.S. Jayasinghe grounds on that night was"
"complete  falsehood.  It  was  his  position  that  he  was  arrested  on  the  11th  of"
"November 2010 while being at the Jayalath Holiday Resort in Ja-ela. According"
"to him, he was arrested along with one Nelson and was detained at a house near"
"the airport, and the said Nelson was released on the following day and he was"
"taken to Puttalam area in the night of the 13th. In Puttalam, three persons were"
"arrested along with drugs was his position. It has been stated by him that he"
"was never arrested with drugs but it was his belief that part of the drugs found"
"in the possession of the persons who were arrested in Puttalam was introduced"
"to him. He has also stated that he was instrumental in finding a large haul of"
"arms and because of that, a politician had to face difficulties, and that also may"
"be a reason for this incident."
