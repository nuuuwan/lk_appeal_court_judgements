"open to argue that their evidence has created a doubt in the prosecution case."
"Hence, I find no merit in the above considered grounds of appeal."
"The 3rd Ground of Appeal: -"
"The  reason  to  argue  that  there  are  contradictory  positions  in  the  way  the"
"appellant was arrested is on the basis of what has been stated by the witnesses"
"as to what happened just before the appellant was confronted by them. PW-01"
"in  his  evidence  has  stated  that  he  saw  the  appellant  paid  the  three-wheeler"
"driver, and thereafter, he and PW-02 went near him. It was the evidence of PW-"
"02  that  the  appellant  was  confronted  while  he  was  in  the  process  of  paying"
"money to the three-wheel driver. I find no contradiction in that regard as argued."
"It is clear, that if one reads the evidence in its totality, both the witnesses had"
"said the same thing in different ways."
"A question has been posed as to why they did not call other officers who took"
"part in the raid to assist them if they had to struggle with the appellant for over"
"10 minutes before he was handcuffed and arrested. I am unable to find a reason"
"to conclude that it has created a reasonable doubt with regard to the arrest, as"
"it may be possible for trained police officers to confront one person in the manner"
"they have stated in their evidence. I find nothing unusual in summoning the rest"
"of the raiding party only after the arrest was made."
"The 4th Ground of Appeal: -"
"I am unable to agree with the contention that there are contradictions inter se"
"and per se of the evidence of PW-01 and 02 that should have been considered as"
"materially relevant in this case. The evidence in relation to the earlier mentioned"
"grounds of appeal cannot be considered contradictions as stated above. I find no"
"basis to conclude that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider any"
"material contradictions in the manner that should have been considered."
