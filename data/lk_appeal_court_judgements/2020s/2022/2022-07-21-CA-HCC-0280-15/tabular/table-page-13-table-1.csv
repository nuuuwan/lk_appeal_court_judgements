"person to call the appellant. It is clear that their intention had been to nab that"
"person  as  well,  if  it  was  possible.  Therefore,  I  am  unable  to  agree  that  it  was"
"improbable  for  the  officers  of  the  PNB,  to  wait  such  a  long  period  expecting"
"another arrest or arrival of a suspect, given the facts and the circumstances of"
"the case as revealed in evidence."
"The 7th and the 8th Grounds of Appeal: -"
"After summarizing the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and after analyzing"
"the said witnesses, it is clear from the judgement that the learned High Court"
"Judge has drawn his attention to the defence taken by the appellant. At page 67"
"of  the  judgement,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  reproduced  the  dock"
"statement made by the appellant in his entity and has considered whether his"
"statement  and  the  stand  taken  by  him  when  the  prosecution  witnesses  gave"
"evidence, has created a reasonable doubt on the case of the prosecution or has"
"given a reasonable explanation as to the evidence against him. I find that this is"
"the correct approach that should be followed when considering the defence of an"
"accused person in a criminal trial. I am unable to agree that the learned High"
"Court Judge has imposed an additional burden on the appellant, by expecting"
"the appellant to prove certain facts. It is clear, the views expressed by the learned"
"High Court Judge was not on that basis, but in order to find whether the version"
"of events as narrated by the appellant has created  a doubt in the prosecution"
"case and nothing more."
"It  needs  to  be  noted  that  the  stand  of  the  appellant,  when  PW-01  gave  his"
"evidence  and  cross-examined  was  on  the  basis  that  a  part  of  a  large  haul  of"
"Heroin detected by PW-01 and his team was introduced to him. However, when"
"PW-02  was  giving  evidence,  the  position  taken  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  had"
"been that a large haul of Hashish had been recovered and was introduced among"
"several  persons.  When  making  a  dock  statement,  the  appellant  has  stated"
"without specifying, that it may be the part of the drugs detected in Puttalam that"
"was introduced to him."
