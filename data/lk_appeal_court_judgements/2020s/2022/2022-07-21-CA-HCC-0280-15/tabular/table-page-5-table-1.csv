"arrested at a place called Jayalath Restaurant situated in Ja-ela while being with"
"another person. It has also been suggested to the witness that the appellant and"
"the other person was taken to a house situated within the Katunayake Airport"
"Complex  and  detained  there,  which  the  witness  had  denied.  The  witness  has"
"been questioned in detail into the manner the police officers enter notes in their"
"information books. It has been suggested to the witness that he and his team"
"detected a large quantity of Heroin at a house in Puttalam and introduced a part"

"possession during the raid. It was also his position that it was the other officers"
"who came to the scene subsequently, searched the three-wheeler and questioned"
"the driver, therefore, he is unable to give evidence in that regard. However, he"
