"The 9th Ground of Appeal: -"
"The learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel questioned the procedure adopted by PW-01 in"
"releasing the three-wheeler driver in whose three-wheeler the appellant is alleged"
"to have arrived. It was his contention that although the said three-wheeler driver"
"who  should  have  been  the  only  independent  witness  to  the incident  has  been"
"named  as  the  14th  witness  for  the  prosecution,  his  address  has  not  been"
"mentioned on the list of witnesses. It was his view that the learned High Court"
"Judge was wrong to attribute the failure of the prosecution to disclose the correct"
"address of the witness to the appellant by saying that he has failed to take any"
"further steps to call him as a witness for himself if he so desired. It is clear from"
"the  evidence  that  PW-01  and  PW-02  has  determined  that  the  three-wheeler"
"driver has no connection to the person who came in the three-wheeler, because"
"according to their evidence, they have seen the appellant paying the hire for the"
"three-wheeler before his arrest. Besides that, it is in evidence that, his statement"
"has  been  recorded  before  his  release.  I  find  that  it  is  not  unusual  when  a"
"detection of this nature is made, not to arrest persons who clearly appear not"
"involved  in  the  crime.  However,  I  find  that  there  is  a  lapse  on  the  part  of  the"
"officer  who  recorded  the  statement  of  the  three-wheeler  driver  as  admitted"
"correctly by the learned ASG. However, I am unable to agree that it has created"
"a doubt in the prosecution case, as a prosecuting Counsel is not bound to call"
"all the witnesses named in the indictment. There is no basis to believe that the"
"prosecution deliberately withheld the evidence of the three-wheeler driver."
"In the case of King vs. Chalo Singho 72 NLR 269, it was held:"
