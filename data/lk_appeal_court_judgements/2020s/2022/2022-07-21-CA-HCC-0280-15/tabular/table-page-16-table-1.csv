"a witness whose name appears at the back of the indictment and whom the"
"prisoner’s counsel has himself an opportunity of calling.”"
"However, in the case under consideration, the learned Counsel who represented"
"the appellant has in fact obtained summons to call witness number 14. It has"
"not been possible due to the fact that no address has been given with regard to"
"him. Although it was not correct for the learned High Court Judge to comment"
"that the appellant has not taken any further steps to call the said witness on his"
"behalf, what needs to be looked at here is whether the non-calling of the said"
"witnesses can lead to the presumption in terms of section 114 (f) of the Evidence"
"Ordinance."
