"order to prove a case is up to the prosecution, the appellant cannot argue that"
"non-calling of more witnesses should be considered in favour of him until he can"
"show that it has led to a situation where a fair trial has not been afforded to him."
"I do not find any such situation in this action. Therefore, I find no merit in the"
"considered ground of appeal either."
"The 10th Ground of Appeal: -"
"It appears that the contention of the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel that a fair trial"
"has not been afforded to the appellant is based on his stand with regard to the"
"earlier considered grounds of appeal. I do not find any reason to accept that no"
"fair trial has been afforded to the appellant. After the conclusion of the evidence"
"led by the prosecution and the defence, the learned High Court Judge has well"
"considered  the  prosecution  evidence  and  the  dock  statement  made  by  the"
"appellant, and has analyzed the same with a clear understanding of the relevant"
"law applicable. He has given clear reasons for his findings, for which I have no"
"reason to disagree with. As he should have, he has considered the totality of the"
"evidence and has determined that the prosecution has proved the case beyond"
"reasonable doubt. Hence, I find no merit in the argument that a fair trial has not"
"been afforded to the appellant."
"For the aforementioned reasons, the appeal of the appellant is hereby dismissed,"
"as I find no merit in the appeal, the conviction and the sentence affirmed."
