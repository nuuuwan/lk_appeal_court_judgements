"urged  in  detail,  while  giving  consideration  to  the  submissions  made  in  that"
"regard  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  as  well  as  the  learned  Additional"
"Solicitor General (ASG) on behalf of the respondent."
"The 1st and the 2nd Grounds of Appeal: -"
"Since the above two grounds of appeal are interrelated, they will be considered"
"together.  The  learned  President’s  Counsel  challenged  the  credibility  of  the  1st"
"information on the basis that PW-01 has given contradictory evidence as to what"
"he  was  informed  by  PW-02,  and  the  actions  they  took  after  the  receipt  of  the"
