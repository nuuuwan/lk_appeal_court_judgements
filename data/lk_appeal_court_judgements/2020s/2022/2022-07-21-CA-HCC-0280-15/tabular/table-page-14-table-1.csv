"This  shows  that  the  stand  of  the  appellant  had  not  been  consistent.  The"
"documents  produced  marked  V1  and  V2  when  the  appellant  made  his  dock"
"statement, have never been produced when the relevant witnesses gave evidence."
"Therefore, the said documents have no value as rightly considered by the learned"
"High  Court  Judge.  It  is  after  considering  all  these  factors  in  its  totality,  the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  has  concluded  that  the  defence  put  forward  by  the"
"appellant has not created any doubt as to the cogent and trustworthy evidence"
"placed  before  the  Court  by  the  prosecution  nor  has  it  provided  a  reasonable"
"explanation."
"Another matter that needs to be considered in relation to the consideration of"
"the  dock  statement  is  the  fact  that  the  appellant  has  made  two  contradictory"
"statements in his dock statement, as viewed correctly by the learned High Court"
"Judge. In the first part of his statement, he has taken up the stand that he was"
"arrested on the 11th, taken to Puttalam, and part of the drugs taken from another"
"party was introduced to him. However, in the second part of his statement, he"
"has stated that “I came with the three-wheeler driver on a hire from Wellawatte"
"and I had Rs. 3000/- with me. The three-wheeler driver was also arrested and I"
"do not know what happened to him. He was the person who has been named as"
"PW-14 in the indictment but he was not called to give evidence, if called he may"
"speak the truth.”"
"By  the  said  statement,  he  has  virtually  accepted  that  he  was  arrested  in  the"
"manner stated by the prosecution witnesses."
"Although the learned President’s Counsel made an attempt in his submission to"
"show that in fact, he was referring to his arrest at a restaurant in Puttalam, I"
"find no basis to agree. I am of the view that, the conclusion in that regard reached"
"by the learned High Court Judge was the only conclusion that can be reached in"
"relation to the dock statement of the appellant."
