"(Page  194  of  the  appeal  brief)  Now,  a  serious  doubt  would  be  cast,"
"because if the well-known ""Samare"" had entered, she would not have"
"shouted 
""someone  had  come 
to 
the  house.""  Since  she  shouted,"
"""someone had come to the house,"" it appears that an unknown person"
"or a known person whose name is unknown had come to kill her son."
"In  addition,  even 
if  PW3's  evidence 
that  she  saw 
the  appellant"
"creeping  into  his  son's  room  is  accepted,  the  only  inference  that  the"
"appellant murdered her son could not be drawn because, according to"
"the  history  given  to  the  doctor  by  PW3,  another  person  also  entered"
"the house with the appellant.  Not only the fact that another person’s"
"involvement was disclosed by PW3 to the doctor, but the Honourable"
"Attorney  General  also 
indicted  the  2nd  accused 
in  relation  to  the"
"offence of  murder. So, when the  PW3  fell unconsciously, there was a"
"possibility 
for  another  person  to  enter  the  room  and  commit  the"
"murder."
"Since no one witnessed the incident of murder, the 1st count has to be"
"proved  on  circumstantial  evidence.  As  it  was  held  in  the  cases  of"

in

"prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had"
"the  opportunity  of  committing  the  offence,  the  accused  can  be  found"
"guilty  only  and  only  if  the  proved  items  of  circumstantial  evidence  is"
"consistent with their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence."
"In  the  case  before  us,  other  than  the  1st  accused-appellant,  the  2nd"
"accused  or  any  other  person  who  entered  the  room  also  had  the"
"opportunity  to  commit  the  murder,  and  the  prosecution  has  not"
