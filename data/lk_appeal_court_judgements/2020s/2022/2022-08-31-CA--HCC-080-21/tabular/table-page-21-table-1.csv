"According  to  the  prosecution  case,  the  deceased’s  fatal  injury  should"
"have occurred inside his room. To conclude that the appellant hit the"
"head of the deceased by using a mamoty, there was no evidence at all"
"that the appellant was possessed with a mamoty when he entered the"
"room of the deceased. PW3 stated that she saw the appellant creeping"
"into  her  son’s  room  but  she  did  not  state  that  the  appellant  was"
"armed with a mamoty or any other weapon when he entered the son’s"
"room."
"It  should  not  be  forgotten  that  the  second  accused  was  also  indicted"
"in  relation  to  the  murder.  The  prosecution  has  not  excluded the"
"possibility  of  causing 
fatal 
injuries  to  the  deeased  by  the  second"
"accused.  No  doubt  this  is  a  grave  crime.  One  person  was  murdered,"
"and three women were injured. 76 years old Wimalawathi was one  of"
"them.  PW1’s  injury  endangered  her  life.  However,  there  are  certain"
"requirements 
in 
law 
to  prove 
criminal 
charges.  A 
fundamental"
"principle 
is 
that 
the  prosecution  must  prove 
its  case  beyond  a"
"reasonable  doubt.    When  considering  the  aforesaid  circumstances,"
"prosecution  evidence  in  respect  of  the  murder  is  consistent  not  only"
"with 
the  guilt  of 
the  appellant.  There  was  a  possibility 
for 
the"
"appellant  to  commit  the  murder,  but  at  the  same  time  the  second"
"accused also had the opportunity to commit the murder and the said"
"possibility 
has 
not 
been 
excluded. 
In 
proving 
a 
charge 
on"
"circumstantial  evidence,  the  evidence  must  be  consistent  only  with"
"the  guilt  of 
the  appellant  and  not  with  any  other  hypothesis."
"Therefore,  I  hold  that  the  1st  count  of  murder  has  not  been  proved"
"beyond a reasonable doubt against the appellant."
"Before  concluding,  it  is  to  be  noted  that  the  aforesaid  discrepancies,"
"contradictions,  and 
improbabilities  have  arisen 
in  the  prosecution"
"case  even  after  their  statements  were  read  over  to  PW1,  PW2,  and"
"PW3 in the police station after receiving summons from the courts to"
