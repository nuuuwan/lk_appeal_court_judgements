for  the  witness  to 
identify  the"
"assailant by voice only."
"In the  case  at  hand, 
the prosecution evidence 
is  not  cogent  and"
"assertive. The vital improbability in PW1's evidence is that if PW1 had"
"correctly  identified  the  appellant  as  the  assaulter,  she  should  have"
"mentioned  his  name  to  the  doctor,  but  instead,  she  said  a  known"
"person whose name is unknown. Because of this critical improbability"
"and

"the appellant’s nor anyone else’s name was mentioned by PW3 in her"
"testimony.  However,  the  learned  State  Counsel  who  prosecuted  the"
"High Court case implicated the appellant’s name as “Samare” and the"
