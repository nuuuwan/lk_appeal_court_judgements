"Evaluation of the Dock Statement"
"In dealing with the grounds of appeal urged by the learned President’s"
"Counsel  for  the  appellant,  I  wish  to  consider  first,  the  ground  of  not"
"considering  the  dock  statement.  It  is  to  be  noted,  that  the  appellant"
"made  a  short  unsworn  statement  from  the  dock  and  there  was  no"
"other  evidence  led  on  behalf  of  the  defence.  Therefore,  the  defence"
"case has been confined to the dock statement. Also,  it is to be noted"
"that the learned Judge who delivered the judgment has heard only the"
"evidence of the last prosecution witness namely the court interpreter’s"
"evidence and the dock statement. All other evidence was led before his"
"predecessors."
