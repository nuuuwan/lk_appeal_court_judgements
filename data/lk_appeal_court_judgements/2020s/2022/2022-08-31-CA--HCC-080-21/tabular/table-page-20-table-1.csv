"murder 
against 
the 
appellant  has  not  been  proved  beyond 
a"
"reasonable doubt."
"PW14, 
the  doctor  who  performed 
the  autopsy  on 
the  deceased"
"expressed his opinion that the injuries that resulted the death of the"
"deceased could be caused by the mamoty marked and produced as a"
"production  of  this  case.  However,  it  is  to  be  noted  that  the  mamoty"
"has  not  been  recovered 
in 
terms  of  section  27  of 
the  Evidence"
"Ordinance upon a statement of the appellant. Hence, the prosecution"
"has failed to establish any connection between the appellant and this"
"mamoty."
"The learned High Court Judge has made the following observation in"
"his judgment and has come to the conclusion that the appellant has"
"committed 
the  murder  using 
this  mamoty.  The 
learned  Judge’s"
"observation is “ඒ අනුව පැ.සො.03 ප්‍රකොශ  කරන පරිදි පළවන චූදිත ඇයට පහර දුන්නන්"
"උදලුමිනටන්  නම්  පළවන  චූදිත  උදැල්ලලක්  රැන න  පැමිණ  ඇති  බව  පැහැදිි  නව්."
".................... නම් අනුව පැ.සො.01, පැ.සො.02, සහ පැ.සො.03 ට පහර දුන් පළවන චූදිත විසින්"
"උදැල්ලලක් වැනි ආයුධයක් භොවිතො කරමින් මරණකරුනේ හිසට පහරදීමක් සිදු කර ඇති බවට"
"අනුමිතියක්  න ොඩන ො   ත  හැකි  අතර  ............”  (Page  31  of  the  judgment)  the"
"learned Judge accepted PW3’s evidence that she was assaulted by this"
"mamoty  and  drew  the 
inference  that  the  appellant  had  used  the"
"mamoty and caused this fatal injury to the deceased as well. However,"
"as  previously  stated 
in  this 
judgment,  PW3  told  the  doctor  who"
"examined  her  that  she  was  assaulted  with  a  knife.  She  stated  in  the"
"evidence  in  chief  that  she  was  assaulted  by  a  pole.  During  cross-"
"examination, she stated that she was assaulted by a mamoty handle."
"When there were three contradictory positions, the learned High Court"
"Judge  chose  to  accept  her  final  version  without  stating  any  reason"
"and  concluded  that  the  appellant  was  armed  with  a  mamoty  and"
"assaulted the deceased with it. I regret to say that this should not be"
"the approach upon which a judicial decision is reached."
