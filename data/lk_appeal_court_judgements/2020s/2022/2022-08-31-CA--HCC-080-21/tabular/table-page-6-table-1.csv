"S
ection  4(d)  of  the  “International  Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political"
"Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007” states that “A person charged of a"
"criminal offence under any written law shall be entitled to examine or"
"to  have  examined 
the  witnesses  against  him  and 
to  obtain 
the"
"attendance  of  witnesses  on  his  behalf,  under  the  same  conditions  as"
"witnesses called against him.” In the instant action, the appellant did"
"not  call  any  witnesses  on  his  behalf.  He  has  chosen  to  present  the"
"defence case by making a dock statement."
"I
t was held in P. P. Jinadasa v. The Attorney General - C.A. 167/2009,"
"decided  on  21.11.2011, 
that 
the  Court  must  consider 
the  dock"
"statement  as  evidence 
subject 
to 
the 
infirmities 
that 
the  dock"
"statement is not under oath and the dock statement is not  tested by"
"cross-examination."
"I
n  the  case  before  us,  the  appellant  denied  his  involvement  in  the"
"incident  in  his  short  dock  statement  which  amounts  to  an  alibi.  The"
"said position taken up by the dock statement has been put to the PW1"
"and  PW2  in  cross-examination  (see  pages  139  and  185  of  the  appeal"
"brief).  So,  it  appears  that  the  appellant  had  maintained  one  position"
"throughtout  the  case.  However,  not  a  single  word  is  stated  in  the"
"judgment in analyzing the dock statement. At least, there is no single"
"word  in  the  impugned  judgment  whether  the  said  dock  statement  is"
"accepted or rejected."
