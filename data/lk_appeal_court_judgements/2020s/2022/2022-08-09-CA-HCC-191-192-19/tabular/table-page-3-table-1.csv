"Prior  to  the  hearing,  written  submissions  were  filed  on  behalf  of  the  1st"
"and  2nd  accused-appellants  and 
the  respondent.  The 
first  accused-"
"appellant  died  before 
the  appeal  was  heard.  Therefore, the 
learned"
"counsel  for  the  second  accused-appellant  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the"
"""appellant"") and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent"
"made oral submissions at the hearing."
