"imprisonment for a term not less than ten years and"
"not  exceeding  twenty  years  and  with  fine  and  shall"
"in  addition  be  ordered  to  pay  compensation  of  an"
"amount  determined  by 
court 
to 
the  person 
in"
"respect  of  whom  the  offence  was  committed  for  the"
"injuries caused to such person."
"21.  The  only  mitigating  circumstances  submitted  on"
"behalf  of  the  appellant  after  conviction  at  the  trial"
"Court  are,  that  he  has  served  in  the  Agriculture"
"Department 
for  38  years  and 
that  he  has 
two"
"children.  Appellant  was  63  years  of  age  at  the  time"
"he was sentenced."
"22.  The 
appellant  who  was 
an 
employee 
at 
the"
"childrenâ€™s  home  has  clearly  taken  advantage  of  the"
"vulnerability of the victim who was placed under its"
"protection  and  care.  This  is  a  serious  aggravating"
"factor. It is a clear breach of trust. The victim would"
"have  expected  the  appellant  to  look  after  her  by"
"virtue  of  his  office  as  an  employee  of  the  home,"
"instead  he  committed  rape  on  her.  This  would  scar"
"her  for  life.  The  impact  of  the  rape  committed  on"
"PW1  has 
been 
duly  noted 
by 
the 
consultant"
"psychiatrist  Dr. Neil Fernando  in  his  report marked"
"P2. Dr. Fernando (PW10) has observed psychological"
"consequences 
of 
trauma, 
fearfulness, 
sleep"
"disturbances 
including 
frequent  nightmares  and"
"thoughts  such  as  uncleanness.  This  impact  on  the"
"victim  must  also  be  taken  into  consideration  when"
"imposing the sentence on the appellant. Thus, when"
"taking  into  account  the  serious  aggravating  factors"
"and the impact on the victim, it is apparent that the"
"ten  year  sentence  of  imprisonment  imposed  on  the"
"appellant  by 
the 
learned  High  Court  Judge 
is"
"grossly  inadequate.  Therefore,  I  set  aside  the  above"
"ten year sentence of imprisonment."
"23.  Finally,  taking  into  account,  the  mitigating  factors"
"mentioned 
above 
including 
the 
fact 
that 
the"
"appellant  has  had  no  previous  convictions  and  the"
"period  the  appellant  had  been  in  incarceration  for"
