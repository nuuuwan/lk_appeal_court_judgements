"[74]  The  Board  Paper  applies  to  all  local  sales  made  to  the  Appellant  from"
"Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd  and  the  commission  was  paid  on  its  local  sales"
"gross value. Once the local sales take place, the Appellant is entitled to affix"
"its own brand name on its subsidiary’s tiles for the purpose of reselling them"
"with its new brand name, through the customer channels of the Appellant."
"[75] Under this arrangement between the parties, it is immaterial for the local"
"seller  (Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd)  whether  the  goods  were  in  fact  used  for"
"exports or not, as long its products are  promoted or handled or sold through"
"the  Appellant’s  sales  channels  and  customer  base.  It  is  immaterial  for  the"
"Appellant 
to  consider  whether 
the  purchases  made 
from  Lanka  Walltile"
"Meepe  Pvt  are  used  to  fulfil  its  local  orders  or  export  orders  as  long  as  the"
"Appellant is able to use its own brand name on tiles manufactured by Lanka"
"Walltile  Meepe  Ltd,  and  earn  profits  former-selling  them  with  its  own  brand"
"name through its outlets and market channels."
"[76]  If  the  Appellant  however,  claimed  that  the  exports  profits  are  part  and"
"parcel  of  its  business  income,  the  Appellant  should  have  produced  separate"
"accounts  to  identify  such  sales  which  were  made  by  the  Appellant  to  third"
"parties though the Appellant’s sales outlets and channels, and  that the sales"
"made 
from  purchases 
for  export  purposes.  Had 
it  produced  separate"
"accounts,  the  Assessor  could  have  identified  the  balance  part  of  its  sales"
"which had been used for sales locally, when its case is that the commission is"
"not related to the entire purchases made from Lanka Walltile Meepe Ltd."
"[77]  According  to  the  schedule  1  of  the  Assessor’s  assessment,  sales  from"
"Lanka Walltile  Meepe Ltd  was  Rs.  210,148,000  (p.  23  of  the TAC  brief) and"
"the Assessor has stated in his letter dated 26.11.2012 that the Appellant has"
"not  included  the  commission  on  local  sales  made  to  the  Appellant  for  the"
"purpose  of  export  in  its  returns.  (p.  24  of  the  TAC  brief).  If  the  Appellant"
"however,  claims  that  the  commission  income  received  from  Lanka  Walltile"
"Meepe  Ltd  and  purchases  made 
from  Lanka  Walltile  Ltd  are  distinct"
"transactions,  the  Appellant  should  have  maintained  and  produced  separate"
"accounts  to  identify  such  transactions  and  the  income  received  from  two"
"transactions  separately.  The  Appellant  has 
failed 
to  produced 
relevant"
"documents and file separate accounts to identify the total purchases made by"
"the  Appellant  from  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd  and  the  income  received  from"
"export orders and the local orders separately."
"[78] On the other hand, if the Appellant claims that the income received from"
"commission related to the goods manufactured by Lanka Walltile Ltd and sold"
"to third parties through its sales outlets and channels as per the board paper,"
"it  could  have  provided  statement  of  accounts  to  identify  the  income  from"
"commission as part of the business income of the Appellant."
