"[87] For those reasons, I answer questions of law arising in the case stated in"
"favour of the Respondent and against the Appellant as follows:"
"1.  No. The overriding effect of section 52 read with section 60(b) is that the"
"qualified  export  profits  and  income  received  by  the  Appellant  could  be"
"regarded as business income of the Appellant if it is part and parcel of the"
"main  business  activities  of  the  Appellant  within  the  meaning  of  section"
"3(1)(a)  of  the  Act.  Section  60(b)  sets  out  the  method  of  computing  the"
"“qualified  export  profits  and  income”  and  section  106(11)  imposes  an"
"obligation  on  the  Appellant  to  maintain  and  keep  separate  accounts  for"
"the  purpose  of  identifying  the  profits  and  income  from  each  business"
"activity separately."
"2.  The  Assessor  must  be  satisfied  that  the  profits  or  income  received  from"
"commission falls  within  the  meaning  of  section 3(1)(a)  or  3(1)(j)  and this"
"decision  is  based  on  the  finding  that  the  commission  income  can  be"
"clearly separated from the rest of the trade or business.  Non-compliance"
"with  section  106(11)  makes  it  difficult  to  the  Assessor  to  ascertain  the"
"profits  or  income  received  from  each  business  activity  separately,  and"
"identify the source of income stipulated in sub-sections 3 (1) (a)-3(1)(j). In"
"the present case, the Appellant has failed to maintain and keep separate"
"accounts for the purpose of identifying the profits and income from each"
