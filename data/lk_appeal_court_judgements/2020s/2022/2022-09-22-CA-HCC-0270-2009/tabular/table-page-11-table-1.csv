"In  this  case  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  considered  the  dock"
"statement of the Appellant in his judgment at page 437-438 of the brief. As"
"the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  considered  the  dock  statement  of  the"
"Appellant in his judgment adequately, the judgment cannot be considered"
"as  an  invalid  judgment  as  contended  by  the  Learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel."
"Hence, the final ground of appeal also devoid any merit."
"Considering all the circumstances, I am of the view that the appeal ought to"
"be dismissed as there is no merit in the pleaded grounds of appeal. Hence, I"
"affirm the conviction and sentence of the Appellant and proceed to dismiss"
"his appeal."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the"
"High Court of Colombo along with the original case record."
