"of  an  acceptable  expert  after  considering  the  material  placed"
"before it by the expert as the basis of his opinion”."
"The  Learned  High  Court  judge  in  his  judgment  very  extensively  discussed"
"the  evidence  given  by  PW46,  the  Senior  Deputy  Government  Analyst  with"
"regard  to  the  gun  and  the  cartridges  both  spent  and  live.  But  he  has  not"
"totally  relied  on  or  delegated  his  functions  to  the  Government  Analyst."
"Nowhere in the judgement indicate that the Learned High Court Judge had"
"abdicated his powers to the Government Analyst. Although the opinion given"
"by the Government Analyst is a scientific one, the Learned High Court Judge"
"only considered his evidence to his own decision with consideration of other"
"evidence."
"Hence, it is incorrect to say that the Learned High court Judge had delegated"
"his function to the expert in this case. Hence, this ground has no merit."
"In the second ground of appeal the Learned President’s Counsel argues that"
"the production chain regarding the gun is totally contradictory and therefore"
"unacceptable."
"In a case of this nature the evidence pertaining to the chain of production"
"plays a crucial role in adjudicating the matter at hand. It has to be proven"
"before court that the same items of recovery had been placed before the court"
"for its consideration. The chain of custody proves the integrity of a piece of"
"evidence.  The  chain  of  custody  includes  the  recovery  of  production,  its"
"custody, its movement from the recovery to the analyst and until it is allowed"
"and admitted in the court. The chain of custody needs to be documented for"
"every  transmission,  that  is  from  the  moment  the  evidence  is  collected,"
