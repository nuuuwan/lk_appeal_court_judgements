"of  the  school.  When  she  complained  to  her 
father,  very  often,  verbal"

"such arguments, the Appellant had used to beat the victim using sticks and"
"broomsticks."
"Several  complaints had  been  lodged  with  the  Wellampitiya and  Peliyagoda"
"Police  Stations.  After 
inquiry,  the  police  had  handed  her  back  to  the"

issuing  a  warning.  Despite
