"In Panchhi and Others v. The State of U.P and Others [1998] 7 SCC 177"
"it was held that:"
"“Evidence of a child witness must be evaluated more carefully and with"
"greater circumspection because a child is susceptible to be swayed by"
"what  others  tell  them  and  thus  a  child  witness  is  an  easy  prey  to"
"tutoring.”"
"In Kumara De Silva and 2 Others v. Attorney General [2010] 2 SLR 169"
"the court held that:"
"“Credibility is a question of fact, not of law…. The acceptance or rejection"
"of  evidence  of  witnesses  is  therefore  a  question  of  fact  for  the  trial"
"judge.”"
"Guided by above mentioned judgments, I will now proceed to consider the"
"appeal grounds advanced by the Appellant."
"In  the  first  ground  of  appeal  the  Appellant  contends  that  the  adoption  of"
"evidence was not done properly under Section 48 of the Judicature Act."
"Section 48 states:"
"“In  the  case  of  death,  sickness,  resignation,  removal  from  office,"
"absence from Sri Lanka, or other disability of any Judge before whom"
"any action, prosecution, proceeding or matter, whether on any inquiry"
"preliminary to committal for trial or otherwise, has been instituted or"
"is  pending,  such  action,  prosecution,  proceeding  or  matter  may  be"
"continued before the successor of such Judge who shall have power to"
"act  on  the  evidence  already  recorded  by  his  predecessor,  or  partly"
"recorded by his predecessor and partly recorded by him or, if he thinks"
"fit, to re-summon the witness and commence the proceedings afresh :"
"Provided  that  where  any  criminal  prosecution,  proceeding  or  matter"
"(except on an inquiry preliminary to committal for trial) is continued"
