"There  was  no  evidence  whatsoever  that  the  respondent  removed  her"
"undergarments.  Also,  there  is  no  proven  fact  to  draw  a  reasonable"
"inference that the respondent removed her undergarments. So, there is"
"no evidence whatsoever to establish the first element. In the absence of"
"evidence that the respondent did the act described in the charge, the"
"question of whether the act was done by using criminal force does not"
"arise."
