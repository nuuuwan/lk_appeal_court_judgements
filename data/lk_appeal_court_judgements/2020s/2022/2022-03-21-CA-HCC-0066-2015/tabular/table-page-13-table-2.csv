"In the case of James Silva Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980)2 SLR 167,"
"it was stated that;"
"“A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider"
"all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by"
"the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and asking himself,"
"whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he"
"believes the accused guilty of the charge on not guilty.”"
