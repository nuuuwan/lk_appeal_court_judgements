"SLR 292 at page 303, Shirani Tilakawardane,J. stated:"
"“…that  whilst  internal  contradictions  or  discrepancies  would  ordinarily"
"affect  the  trustworthiness  of  the  witness  statement,  it  is  well  established"
"that  the  Court  must  exercise  its  judgment  on  the  nature  and  tenor  of  the"
"inconsistency or contradiction and whether they are material to the facts in"
"issue. Discrepancies, which do not go to the root of the matter and assail"
"the  basic  version  of  the  witness,  cannot  be  given  too  much  importance."
