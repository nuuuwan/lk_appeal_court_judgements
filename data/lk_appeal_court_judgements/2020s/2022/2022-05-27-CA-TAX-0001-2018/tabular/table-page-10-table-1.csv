"application of tax principles. In the aforementioned judgment, the Indian"
"Supreme Court considered Section 32 (1) of the Indian Income Tax Act,"
"where  it is expressly provided that depreciation allowance is allowed in"
"respect of property ""owned"" by the assessee, in whole or in part.  In that"
"case, the Supreme Court of India gave a liberal interpretation to the specific"
"word “owned”, for revenue purposes."
"In this case, the lease exists between the landlord, Ananda Simon Pattiya,"
"and Kurklinik (Pvt) Ltd. It is evident from the terms of the lease agreement"
"that the lessee, Kurklinik (Pvt) Ltd, is permitted to construct permanent or"
"semipermanent buildings on the land. The lessee has agreed to deliver up"
"and surrender the premises to the lessor at the expiration or other sooner"
"determination of the term of the lease, without any reservation. It is settled"
"law  that  a  lessee  cannot  even  claim  compensation  unless  it  is  expressly"
"stipulated for its payment."
"Therefore, it is Kurklinik (Pvt) Ltd which could exercise the dominium on"
"the property during the term of operation of the lease and not the appellant"
"holding  under  the  lessee.  Consequently,  even  under  a  liberal  rule  of"
"interpretation, 
the  appellant  cannot  be  regarded  as 
the  owner  of 
the"
"immovable."
"On the other hand, even if the appellant built the hotel building, he does"
"not have soil rights of the land on which it is built. As a result, he is not"
"entitled to the building. His rights, if any, being a bonafide possessor is the"
"right to compensation in respect of the buildings, against the owners of the"
"land.  In  ordinary  circumstances  at 
this 
instance 
the  maxim  quicquid"
"plantatur solo solo cedit (which is affixed to the soil goes with the soil)"
"should apply."
"However,  as  it  was  correctly  submitted  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"Appellant,  there  is  an  exception  to  the  above  rule,  the  servitude  of  ius"
"superficiarium. The essence of the concept is an interest in a building, apart"
"from the land on which it stands. The agreement between the landowner"
"and 
the  person  who  acquires 
the  right, 
is 
the  foundation  of 
the 
ius"
"superficiarium. In Ahamado Natchia v. Muhamado Natchia27 Layard C. J.,"
"observed ‘the right is acquired and lost like immovable property, and is"
"even  presumed  to  be  granted,  when  the  owner  of  the  ground  permits"
"another  to build  thereupon.  The right  can  be  alienated…’.  Maasdorp  in"
