"Dr.  Sunil  F.  A.  Coorey  in  his  treatise  “Principles  of  Administrative  Law  in  Sri"
"Lanka”  4th  edition  volume  1  describes  the  usage  of  the  words  unlawful  and"
"illegal as follows,"
"“The words “unlawful” and “illegal” are used, mostly as synonyms, and most to"
"refer to a purely physical act (as distinguished from an exercise of power or an"
"act in the law) which entails to its doer, unpleasant legal consequences, namely"
"punishment on the basis that such act is an offence created by law, or damages"
"on the basis  that such  act is  an actionable civil wrong or delict, or both such"
"consequences.”"
