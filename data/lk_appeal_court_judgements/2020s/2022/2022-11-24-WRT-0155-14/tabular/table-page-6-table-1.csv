"grievance  of  the  Petitioner  is  that,  the  construction  of  the  3rd  Respondent"
"obstructs the public access to the beach."
"I
  will  deal  with  the  alleged  obstruction  to  the  Madel  fishery  later  under  a"
"separate sub heading and I have come to the conclusion that the Petitioner has"
"failed to establish that this particular area has been declared as a Madel Waraya."
"In  the  inspection  report  marked  R7  the  acting  Director  General  of  the  coast"
"conservation  department  and  the  Assistant  Director  (planning)  of  the  coast"
"conservation  department  state  that 
it  was  revealed  at  a 
field 
inspection"
"conducted  by  them  that  the  3rd  Respondent  had  constructed  the  building"
"keeping away a reservation of 20 meters from the permanent vegetation line."
"That  report  does  not  reveal  the  fact  that  the  3rd  Respondent  had  filled  the"
"nearby estuary or felled the vegetation in the area. In the letter marked 3R10C"
"the District Irrigation Engineer had drawn the attention of the 3rd Respondent to"
"a  canal  which  is  blocked  by  sand.  But  that  letter  does  not  say  that  the  3rd"
"Respondent  had  filled  the  nearby  estuary  or  felled  the  vegetation. 
In  the"
"document marked P16 the Director General of coast conservation and coastal"
"resource  management  and  the  Director  coastal  resource  management  had"
"observed that the 3rd Respondent had filled the land without approval. But they"
"have not observed that the 3rd Respondent had filled the nearby estuary and fell"
"the  vegetation.  Therefore,  one  cannot  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  3rd"
"Respondent had filled the nearby estuary and fell the vegetation. Although the"
"3rd Respondent had filled his land without approval there is no evidence to show"
"that it will have a significant impact on the villagers and the residents. Therefore,"
"the grievance is confined to the obstruction to the beach access of the villagers"
"and  the  residents.  One  cannot  demand  access  to  the  beach  over  another"
"person’s land without his consent unless the users had acquired a prescriptive"
"right to do so. Here in this case there is no evidence to show that the villagers"
"had acquired such a right or there was a custom to that effect.  However, the"
"documents marked 3R6, 3R7A, 3R7B, 3R7C, 3R7D, 3R7E, 3R8A, 3R8B produced"
"by  the  3rd  Respondent  show  that  the  villagers  and  the  residents  have  an"
"alternative  roadway  providing  them  access  to  the  beach  and  there 
is  no"
"necessity  for  them  to  walk  over  the  3rd  Respondent’s  land.  The  earlier  road"
"remains up to the 3rd Respondent’s land. Thereafter, the road proceeds to the"
"beach over a block of land donated to the Balapitiya Pradeshiya Sabawa by one"
