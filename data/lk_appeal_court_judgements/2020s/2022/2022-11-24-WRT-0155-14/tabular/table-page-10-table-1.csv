intent  of  the  setback  guidelines.  An  exemption  will  be"
"granted only if the proposed activity serves a compelling public purpose which"
"provides benefits to the public as a whole as opposed to individual or private"

interests  may  request  for  a  setback"
"variance. An exemption or a variance may be granted by the director only if the"
"advisory council determines that there are compelling reasons for allowing it"
"and recommends granting it. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted"
"what  has  been  granted  to  the  3rd  Respondent  is  an  exemption  and  not  a"
"variance.  He  argued  that  there 
is  a  significant  deviation  from  the  setback"
"guidelines. Whether it is an exemption or a variance will only be a question of"
"academic interest.  Even assuming that it is  an exemption the permission had"
"been granted to the 3rd Respondent to build an ayurvedic medical center (SPA)"
"“දෙමහල් අයුර් දෙිෙ මධ්‍යස්ථානයක් (SPA) ඉදිකිරීම”. Therefore, the proposed activity"
"serves a compelling public purpose which provides benefits to the public as a"
"whole,  to  the  locals  as  well  as  foreigners.  There  is  no  evidence  to  show  that"
"adverse  environmental 
impacts  exist.  Therefore, 
the  question  of 
taking"
"reasonable  steps  to  minimize  then  will  not  arise.  Before  deciding  to  grant"
"permission 
to 
the  3rd  Respondent 
the  advisory  council  had 
taken 
in 
to"
"consideration the type of precedent set by similar decisions of this nature. Such"
"similar decisions are reflected in the minutes of the advisory council meetings"
"tendered along with the statement of objections of the 1st and 2nd Respondents."
"According to those minutes of the advisory council meetings it appears that the"
"permission  had  been  granted  to  build  a  three  storied  tourist  complex 
in"
"Ambalangoda close to this place covering the entire restricted area (which is 30"
"meters  in  that  area)  and  the  permission  had  been  granted  to  build  a  three"
"storied  hotel  in  Akurala,  also  close  to  this  place  just  merely  keeping  off  one"
"meter away from the restricted area. In the instant case the 3rd Respondent had"
"kept 5 meters free from the restricted area. Therefore, the advisory council had"
"used  their  discretion  fairly  and  reasonably  and  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents"
"acting on the recommendation of the advisory council were justified in granting"
"a permit to the 3rd Respondent. One cannot say that the 1st and 2nd Respondents"
"acted unlawfully and their act is ultra vires and illegal."
