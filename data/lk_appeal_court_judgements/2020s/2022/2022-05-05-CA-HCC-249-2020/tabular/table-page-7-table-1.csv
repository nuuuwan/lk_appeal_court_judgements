"Learned counsel for the appellant states that in the case of Nissanka Vs. State (Supra) there was"
"strong  evidence  placed  before  the  Court  that  was  only  known  to  the  accused-appellant  which"
"demanded the accused under section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance to explain. In the present case,"
"the  prosecution  had  relied  on  a  dying  declaration  which  has  serious  infirmities.  Therefore,  it  is"
"wrong in applying the side principle and drawing an adverse inference of guilt against the accused-"
"appellant which would reverse the presumption of innocence. On the above grounds, it was stated"
"that the prosecution had failed to prove the case against the accused-appellant beyond reasonable"
"doubt."
"Counsel  for  the  accused-appellant  further  submitted  that  the  learned  trial  Judge  had  wrongly"
"rejected the dock statement made by the accused-appellant and the learned High Court Judge had"
"wrongly drawn an adverse inference of guilt against the accused-appellant. It is important to note"
"that  the  dock  statement  is  a  bare  denial  and  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  given  adequate"
"weight and consideration to the same and arrived at the correct conclusion that the dock statement"
"cannot raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case."
"For  all  these  reasons  the  conviction  of  the  accused-appellant  is  affirmed.  No  submissions  were"
"made in the course of the hearing about the sentence, and hence the mandatory sentence imposed"
"by the trial Judge on the appellant in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code will stand."
"In light of the facts and applicable legal principles peculiar to this matter in question, this appeal"
"has failed to hold any merit. The conviction, therefore, is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed."
"Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment along with the main case record to the High"
"Court of Colombo and a copy of the judgement to the prison authorities forthwith."
