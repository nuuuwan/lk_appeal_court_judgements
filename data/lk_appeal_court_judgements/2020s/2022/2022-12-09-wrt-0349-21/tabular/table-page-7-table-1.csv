"The  purported  license  No.  IM-3-515-2021-001428  (annexed  along  with  the  documents"
"marked  as  ‘X9’)  relied  on  by  the  Petitioner  has  been  expired  on  30.06.2021  and  as  per"
"‘X12’ the relevant shipment has been loaded on 07.07.2021. No evidence has been placed"
"before  this  Court  contrary  to  the  stand  taken  by  the  Respondents  that  the  subject"
"consignment of sugar has been shipped and landed after the expiry of the above license"
"upon which the Petitioner claims validity of the shipment."
"The aforesaid Extraordinary Gazette Notification No.2199/20 by which the importation"
"of sugar has become subjected to Licenses from 30.10.2020 is still in full force. In terms of"
"section 4(1) of the Import and Export Control Act, no person shall import into or export"
"from Sri Lanka any goods except under the authority or otherwise than in accordance with"
"the  conditions  of  a  license  issued  on  that  behalf  under  the  said  Act  by  the  Controller"
"General. Hence, I am convinced that when an expiry date is given in the Import Control"
"License  it  should  be  considered  as  a  condition  for  respective  importation  under  such"
"license. The consignments imported after the date of expiry should be considered as an"
"importation without an Import Control License."
"On the other hand, in terms of Section 12 of the Customs Ordinance, the restricted goods"
"which are subjected to Import Control License shall not be imported. The goods which"
"are imported in violation to the conditions stipulated and in contrary to the Regulations"
"are eventually subjected to be forfeited in terms of Section 43 of the Customs Ordinance."
"Thus,  even  in  an  event  this  Court  decides  to  quash  the  Notification,  marked  ‘X7’,  the"
"importation of subject consignment of sugar cannot be justified as the Gazette Notification"
"No.2199/20 is intact and the Petitioner is required to import the subject goods only by"
"way of a valid license issued as a result of the said Gazette Notification No.2199/20."
"The Petitioner is challenging the vires of the aforesaid Gazette Notification No.2199/20"
"by  way  of  another  Application  bearing  No.  CA/Writ/341/2021  filed  in  this  Court."
"According to the Respondents any decision given by this Court  in the said Application"
"CA/Writ/341/2021 will have no bearing on the instant application as the Petitioner had"
"imported the relevant consignment of sugar without a valid license. It is salient that the"
"Petitioner has chosen not to challenge the said Gazette Notification No.2199/20 in the"
"instant application."
