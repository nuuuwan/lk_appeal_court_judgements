"S.A. De Smith’s, ‘Judicial Review’ 8th Edition, (at p. 999) notes:"
"“It has long been held to be preferable for the claimant to be able to show that he has"
"demanded performance of the duty and that performance has been refused by the authority"
"obliged  to  discharge  it.  A  claimant,  before  applying  for  judicial  review,  should  address  a"
"distinct and specific demand or request to the defendant that he perform the duty imposed"
"upon him. Today this learning is encapsulated in the general obligation on claimants to follow"
"the  steps  set  out  in  the  Pre-Action  Protocol  for  Judicial  Review,  which  includes  writing a"
"letter before claim.”"
