"fraudulent  practice  of  registering  new  vehicles  using  details  of  old  vehicles  and  a  CID"
"investigation surrounding 36 vehicles that did not have valid number plates. In the light of"
"actual  or  potential  fraudulent  practices  being  carried  out  exercising  caution  and  referring"
"this case to be investigated seems prudent."
"On that basis, the Respondent contends that there has been no refusal per se to issue"
"the  set  of  number  plates  as  the  same  can  only  be  issued  at  the  conclusion  of  the  CID"
"investigation confirming that there was no fraud involved in the registration of the vehicle."
"We agree with this contention. It is trite law that demand for the performance of the"
"duty and a refusal to perform it must precede an application for Mandamus."
"In Ratnayake v. C.D. Perera [1982] 2 SLR 451 his Lordship Sharvananda, J. (as he"
"then was) held:"
"“The general rule of Mandamus is that its function is to compel a public authority to"
"do its duty. The essence of Mandamus is that it is a command issued by the superior Court"
"for the performance of public legal duty. Where officials have a public duty to perform and"
"have refused to perform, Mandamus will lie to secure the performance of the public duty, in"
"the performance of which the applicant has sufficient legal interest.” [emphasis added]"
"In the case of Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs Jafferjee and Jafferjee"
"(Pvt)  Ltd  [2005]  1  SLR  89  his  Lordship  J.A.N.  De  Silva,  J.  (as  he  then  was),  with  their"
"Lordships S.N. Silva C.J. and Weerasuriya J. agreeing, set out the some of the prerequisites"
"for  issuing  a  Writ  of  Mandamus.  One  such  condition  was  that  “the  application  must  be"
"preceded by a distinct demand for the performance of the duty.” [emphasis added]"
