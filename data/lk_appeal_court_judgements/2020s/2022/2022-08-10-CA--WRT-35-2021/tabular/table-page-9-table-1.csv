"in the nature of a writ of Certiorari as prayed for in paragraph (d) of the prayer of the Petition"
"of the Petitioner."
"Moreover, I am not inclined to grant other reliefs as prayed for by the Petitioner and I have"
"arrived at that decision based on the defense taken up by the Respondents. The contention of"
"the Respondents is that they were compelled to suspend the appointments made to the post"
"of ‘Staff Assistant’ as the required approval of the Department of the Management Services"
"had not been obtained to establish the said post of ‘Staff Assistant’."
"I  am  aware  that  the  Public  Sector  cadre  management,  remuneration  management  and"
"consultancy are also among the objectives of the Department of Management Services. It is a"
"prime duty of the said Department to provide the necessary management service assistance"
"to the Public Sector Organizations. Accordingly, I take the view that this Court should not"
"trespass the authority of the Department of Management Services at this stage substituting or"
"recommending  any  decision  of  this  Court  for  that  of  the  said  authority  in  reference  to  the"
"change of designations of SJGH. It is the duty of the Board of SJGH to resolve, according to"
"law, the issues on changing the designations of the employees."
