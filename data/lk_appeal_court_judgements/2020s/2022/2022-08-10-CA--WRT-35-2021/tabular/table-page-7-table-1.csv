"Although  the  Establishment  Code  is  not  directly  applicable  to  SJGH,  I  need  to  draw  my"
"attention  to  the  rationale  adopted  in  its  provisions  of  Chapter  VII  of  the  said  Code  which"
"deals with ‘salaries’. The Clause 9:1 of the Establishment Code stipulates that when an officer"
"who  had  prior  service  under  government  whether  in  a  permanent  or  temporary  capacity,"
"secures a fresh appointment under the government, he may be given incremental credit for"
"the prior service as mentioned therein. I am aware that those provisions mainly deal with the"
"increments entitled to an employee but what is necessary to abstract from those provisions is"
"the particular rationale adopted therein. In those provisions, a proper mechanism has been"
"introduced for an employee to secure another position within the government sector without"
"any  hinderance  to  the  rights  in  reference  to  his  or  her  previous  service  in  the  government"
"sector. The usual practice is that if a government servant secures another position within the"
"government sector, subject to necessary sanctions, such person would be placed at the fitting"
"salary step of the new salary scale without discriminating rights of such person."
"Anyhow, it doesn’t appear that any such effective rationale has been adopted by the Board of"
"SJGH when taking the decision to reduce the salary of the Petitioner or change her salary"
"scale.  The  phrase  used  by  the  said  Board  when  arriving  at  the  said  impugned  decision  in"
"‘P23(a)’ is “automatically”. I cannot accept any reason for deduction of the salary or placing"
"the  Petitioner  at  a  different  salary  scale  only  based  on  the  term  “automatically”  without"
"enumerating a proper rationale for the decision. I take the view that the Board of SJGH has"
"failed to give adequate and lawful reasons for deducting the salary and also, I am unable to"
"accept the opinion of the said Board that ‘automatically’ a person’s salary needs to be changed"
"merely based on the salary scale applicable to the reverted post."
"The  Petitioner’s  argument  is  that  the  post  of  ‘Chief  Management  Assistant’  and  ‘Staff"
"Assistant’ is one and the same. However, the Respondent totally deny such assertions.  The"
"Respondents’ contention is that any change/alteration in the name of post within the SJGH"
"should  be  approved  by  both  the  Board  of  Management  of  SJGH  and  the  Department  of"
"Management Services. The Respondents further allege that the stand taken by the Petitioner"
"is not acceptable as no such board decision or a relevant document has been produced by the"
"Petitioner."
