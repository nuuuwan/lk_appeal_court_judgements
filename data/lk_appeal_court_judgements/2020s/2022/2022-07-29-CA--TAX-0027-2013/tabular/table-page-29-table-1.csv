"extended unless the plain language employed in the exemption reasonably"
"required its application to the situation which is brought before the Court; (ii)"
"but  the running of the canteen by an independent contractor, even though"
"can be regarded as running of the canteen on behalf of the employer cannot"
"be exempted from sales tax."
"[73] In my view the scope of the exemption in that case was limited to the"
"employer or employee running the canteen on a co-operative basis as the"
"possibility of the canteen being run by without a profit motion would be real"
"when  the  employer  does    not  normally  seek  to  make  a  profit  of  his  own"
"employees who run a canteen on co-operative basis for the benefit of their"
"members."
"[74]  The  facts  of  the  two  cases    relied  on  by  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor"
"General are distinct from the facts of the present case, and thus, those cases"
"cannot be applied to the present case. The concessionary tax rate is granted"
"to an undertaking engaged in the business of a travel agent or transportation"
"of tourists for the purpose of promoting tourism and where the assessee falls"
"within the category of such an undertaking, he will be entitled to the benefit"
"of the concessionary tax rate specified in section 45 (2) (d)."
"[75]  The 
learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General 
further  submitted 
that 
the"
"Appellant did not have a contract with tourists, but only with the Sri Lankan"
"Airlines,  and 
therefore, 
the  Appellant  has  no  business  with 
tourists  or"
"passengers. It is relevant to note that the Appellant performed all services"
"for the Airline and its passengers  on its Layover Programme on behalf of the"
"SriLankan  Airlines Ltd  and  received  payment/commission from  the  Airline."
"But the SriLankan Airlines Ltd was not carrying on business of a travel agent,"
"and  it  is  only  the  Appellant  who  was  carrying  on  the  business  of  a  travel"
"agent.  Thus, 
 
the  SriLankan  Airlines  Ltd  could  not  have  claimed 
the"
"concessionary tax rate of 15% specified in section 45 (2) (d) (iii) of the IRA"
"2006. In my view, there is no need whatsoever for the Appellant to enter into"
"a  separate  agreement  with  passengers  or  tourists  in  order  to  claim  the"
"concessionary tax rate of 15% specified in section 45 (2) (d) (iii) of the IRA"
"2006."
"[76] The word “business” is defined in Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act"
"of 2006. It reads as follows:"
"“Business” includes an agricultural undertaking, the racing of horses, the"
"letting or leasing of any premises, including any land by a company and"
"the forestry”."
"[77]  The  definition  of 
in  Section  217 
is 
inclusive  and  not 
“business”"
"exhaustive  in  nature  and  thus,  it  includes  an  agricultural  undertaking,  the"
"racing of horses, the letting or leasing of any premises, including any land by"
"a company and the forestry. The concept of “undertaking” is wider than the"
"mere term “business” referred to in Section 217. It encompasses every entity"
