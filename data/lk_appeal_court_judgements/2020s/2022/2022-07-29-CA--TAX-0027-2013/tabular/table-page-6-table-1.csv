"“SriLankan Layover Programme  includes:  all  passenger programmes  of"
"SriLankan Airlines for their Transit Passengers, travelling via Sri Lanka”."
"Further the nature of the services performed by the Appellant under the"
"agreement with the SriLankan Airlines Ltd.  is in relation to such transit"
"passengers, it is the service that is necessary to be performed in respect"
"of these passengers under the said agreement. Therefore, under these"
"circumstances,  such  passengers  who  are  not 
tourists  but 
transit"
"passengers,  as  far as  the SriLankan  Airlines  Ltd.  is  concerned, cannot"
"become tourists for the Appellant no sooner the Appellant takes charge of"
"them, to provide the necessary services under the said agreement...(pp 5-"
"6)"
"It is to be observed that according to the agreement , the Appellant is only"
"a handling agent. ...if these services are provided by the Appellant on his"
"own, independently of an agreement with a third party, then the Appellant"
"would be entitled to be charged with tax at the appropriate rate specified"
"in the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act. At present, the Appellant"
"is enjoying  such  concessionary  tax  benefits  from  his own  business  of a"
"travel agency. But, what the Appellant is seeking to do now, is to obtain"
"such concessionary tax benefits for the services he has performed under"
"the agreement with the SriLankan Airlines Ltd. Since, these services are"
"performed  by 
the  Appellant  under  an  agreement  with 
the  SriLankan"
"Airlines Ltd, in the capacity of a handling agent, even if these services are"
"offered to travellers, the Appellant cannot seek the benefit bestowed on a"
"travel agent from  such  activity.  This is because,  the  Appellant  performs"
"these services under an agreement in the capacity of a handling agent"
"and not as a travel agent” (pp 6-7)."
