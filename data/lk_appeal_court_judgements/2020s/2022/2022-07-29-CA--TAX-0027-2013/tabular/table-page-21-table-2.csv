"parsing  of  the  wording  of  the  particular  clause,  but  that  the  court  must"
"consider the contract as a whole and, depending on the nature, formality"
"and quality of drafting of the contract, give more or less weight to elements"
"of the wider context in reaching its view as to that objective meaning."
"[49] Accordingly, the apparent contractual arrangement will not represent the"
"true relationship between the parties if the evidence is wholly inconsistent with"
"the apparent contractual arrangement, or if the parties have failed to operate"
"the  contractual  arrangements,  or  contractual  arrangements  are  a  sham, or if"
"the evidence is wholly inconsistent with the apparent contractual arrangement."
"In short, what is required is to consider whether or not the contractual terms"
"constitute a purely artificial arrangement which does not correspond with the"
"commercial and economic reality of the transaction."
"[50] In interpreting the categorisation of a relationship between the parties, it is"
"necessary,  first  to  identify,  the  parties’  respective  rights  and  obligations-the"
"activities to be carried out by the parties in terms of the Agreement and the real"
"intention and the surrounding circumstances rather than to conclusively rely on"
"the  labels  which  the  parties  have  used  to  describe  their  relationship  in  the"
"Agreement. It must then decide,  having regard to those rights and obligations"
"and the surrounding circumstances as a whole, whether the Appellant, can be"
"properly characterised as a “travel agent” or a mere “handling agent”."
