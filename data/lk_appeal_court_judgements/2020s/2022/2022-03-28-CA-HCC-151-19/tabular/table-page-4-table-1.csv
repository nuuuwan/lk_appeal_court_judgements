"As  correctly  observed  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  the  said  eye"
"witness is an independent witness. It is apparent that he had no reason"
"to give false evidence against the driver of the bus or in favour of him."
"According to the said witness, the appellant drew the bus at excessive"
"speed and collided with the deceased. The eye witness stated that the"
"driver did not apply breaks before the accident and has applied breaks"
"only after the accident."
