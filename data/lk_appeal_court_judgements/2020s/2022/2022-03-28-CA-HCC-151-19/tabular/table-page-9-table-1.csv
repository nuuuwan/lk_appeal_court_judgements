"In the case of Palansuriya V. Johoran â€“ 48 NLR 400, it was found on"
"the circumstances of that case, that the accused must have driven his"
"lorry at an inordinately excessive speed, and it  was held that he was"
"guilty of the very high degree of negligence in the means adopted by him"
"to avoid the risk consequent on the speed of the lorry. In the said case,"
"the lorry went across the grass verge of the road, a distance of nearly"
"50 feet. In the action before us, although the bus has not gone across"
"the grass verge, it has come in inordinately excessive speed where the"
"appellant could not stop the bus in a distance more than 80 feet even"
"after applying break. It was held further in the said case that there was"
"prima facie evidence of negligence casting upon the accused the onus"
"of proving that there was no negligence."
