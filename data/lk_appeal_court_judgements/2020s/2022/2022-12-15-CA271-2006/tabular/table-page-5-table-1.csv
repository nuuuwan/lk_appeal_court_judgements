"Considering the written submissions of both counsels, I set out my reasoning below:-"
"T
he Petitioner had bought the rights of the 18th Defendant while a partition action was pending. He"
"had agreed to accept what the 18th Defendant would get in the judgment of the partition action. A"
"person purchasing a property subject to a partition action will only have a right once the final decree"
"is  entered.  Until  then,  the  purchaser  will  not  know  where  and  what  he  will  get.  Therefore,  any"
"action, such as building without court permission, will be an act which will affect the property.  In"
"such an instance, the District Court has the power to safeguard the property's nature and maintain"
