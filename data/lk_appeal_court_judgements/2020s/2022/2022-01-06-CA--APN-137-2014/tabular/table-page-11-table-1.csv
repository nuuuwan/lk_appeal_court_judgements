"As such, it is apparent that the Petitioner has slept over his rights. According to the legal maxim"
"“Vigilantibus Non Dormientibus Jura Subveniunt”, the law assists only those who are vigilant, and"
"not those who sleep over their rights. The said maxim refers to the obligation of individuals to not"
"only be aware of their rights under the Law, but also to be vigilant while exercising or using the"
"same. The legal process only benefits those who have been careful enough with their rights, instead"
"of being ignorant."
