"Secondly, the Assistant Judicial Medical Officer has not revealed how"
"she  ascertained  the  time  of  the  death.  The  prosecutor  failed  to  lead"
"that evidence. The deceased may have died while being brought to the"
"hospital. Even before that, his death could have occurred. Thus, there"
"is no way of ascertaining the time of the death accurately."
