"the  appellant  admitted  in  his  evidence  that  when  the  HQI  took  out"
"what was in the bag and searched, he found that it was heroin (Page"
"347 of the appeal brief)."
"F
urthermore,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  contended  that  a"
"statement of PW-3 had not been recorded by the HQI of the Panadura"
"Police  Station,  and 
if  his  statement  had  been  there,  the  defence"
"counsel  could  have  cross-examined  him  on  the 
facts  of  the  said"
"statement  and  pointed  out  discrepancies  between  the  statement  and"
"his  evidence.  The  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  stated  that  PW-3"
"had  made  his  notes  regarding  this  incident.  The  learned  High  Court"
"Judge  has  considered  this  and  his  view  was  that  not  recording  a"
"statement is a flaw, but it is not a decisive factor. I agree with the view"
"of the learned High Court Judge because the learned defence counsel"
"was  entitled 
to 
the  notes  of  PW-3  as 
there  was  no  other 
first"
"information regarding this matter. Although PW-3 was a police officer,"
"he  did  not  search  the  parcel  or  arrest  the  appellant  in  the  course  of"
"his official duties. This incident occurred while he was traveling on the"
"bus after  finishing  his duties  for  the  day.  Therefore,  his  statement"
"could have been recorded as the first information about this incident."
"However,  no  prejudice  has  been  caused  to  the  appellant,  as  he  was"
"entitled to the notes made by PW-3."
"U
nder  these  circumstances,  there  was  no  reason  to  doubt  PW-3's"
"testimony.  However,  it  should  be  considered  whether  the  appellant's"
"evidence would cast reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case.  The"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  has  decided  that  the  two  charges  against"
"the  appellant  have  been  proved  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  and  no"
"reasonable  doubt  has  arisen  due  to  the  improbable  defence  version."
"The  contention  of  the  learned  DSG  for  the  respondent  was  also  that"
"the defence version was improbable."
