"The two paragraphs of the judgment cited above clearly demonstrates that"
"the  learned  High  Court  judge  had  reversed  the  burden  of  proof,  which  is"
"unknown to the criminal prosecution. As contended by the Counsel for the"

"equal position during the course of a trial. It would be difficult to identify in"
"advance all of the situations that could constitute violations of the fair trial"
"principle."
