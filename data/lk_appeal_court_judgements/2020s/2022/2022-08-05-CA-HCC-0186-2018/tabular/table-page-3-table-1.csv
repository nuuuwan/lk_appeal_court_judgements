"pandemic restrictions in place. Also, at the time of argument the Appellant"
"was connected via zoom platform from prison."
"The Counsel for the Appellant advanced the following grounds of appeal:"
"1. The prosecution has failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that"
"sexual intercourse took place without the consent of the prosecutrix."
"2. The  learned  trial  Judge  has  grievously  erred  in  law  by  shifting  the"
"burden of proof to the Appellant thereby reversing the presumption of"
"innocence and occasioned in a deprivation of a fair trial."
"In this case the prosecutrix had been married for three and half months but"
"had ceased living together with her spouse. At the time of the incident, she"
"was living with her mother and her elder brother. On the day of the incident,"
"she was alone at home as her mother and the brother had left to engage in"
"Chena  cultivation.  Around  noon,  when  the  prosecutrix  was  collecting  her"
"clothes to go for a bath at Mannakettiya Tank, she had heard the sound of a"
"motor-bike  outside  her  house.  Before  she  could  come  out  of  her  room  to"
"check who it was, the Appellant who was well known to her was standing at"
"the entrance to the room in which the prosecutrix was standing. Although"
"the prosecutrix had testified that she knew the Appellant very well and he"
"had  visited  her  home  on  previous  occasions  she  had  denied  having  any"
"relationship with him. The Appellant had first adjusted the curtains of the"
"windows in the room and invited her to have sex with him. The victim had"
"refused the request and had attempted to exit the room. Then the Appellant"
"had forcibly covered her mouth with one of her sisterâ€™s dresses, thrust her"
"on  the  bed,  removed  her  under  garment,  raised  her  dress  up  to  her  chest"
"level and committed the act of rape on the prosecutrix."
"PW2 who was living in the neighbouring house had rushed to the room upon"
"hearing the cries of the prosecutrix and had seen the Appellant lying on top"
"of  the  prosecutrix  and  had  observed  that  the  prosecutrix  was  without  her"
