he learned President’s Counsel also contended that the learned High"
"Court Judge has allowed to lead evidence regarding the bad character"
"of the appellant by allowing to disclose about a rape case filed against"
"the appellant in the Walasmulla Courts. (Pages 85 and 86 of the appeal"

"PW1 had to disclose about this rape case. The question put to the PW1"
"in cross-examination is as follows:"
"මාල  දීලා,  තමෝටර්  සයිකල්  දීලා,  සල්ලි  දීලා  ඒේ  තමුන්ද  එක්ක  රණ්ඩු  කරනවා  ඇයි  ඒ  එො"
"අඩදබර තවන්දතන්ද?"
"The answer given by the PW1 was “තමොට තර්ප් තක්ස් එකකුේ තිබුනා වලස්මුල්ල"

"explain a relevant fact to the case. Without disclosing about this rape"

"and the appellant."
"A
nyhow, the instant action is a murder case and the disclosure of the"
"said rape case filed against the appellant did not cause any prejudice"
"to the appellant in deciding this case because the learned High Court"
"Judge has never considered the said evidence of bad character of the"
"appellant in determining this action. Especially, as this is a case based"
"on  circumstantial  evidence,  considering  his  bad  character  or  good"
"character was not relevant at all in deciding the case. In addition, it is"
