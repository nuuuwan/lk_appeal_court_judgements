"of 
intoxication 
is  accepted,  the  appellant  has  to  be  convicted

"culpable homicide not amounting to murder. However, if the argument"
"of  the  improbability  of  committing  this  offence  by  the  appellant  is"
"accepted, the appellant has to be acquitted."
"W
hen the accused-appellant gave evidence, he said that he consumed"
"liquor heavily on that day. The said defence of intoxication would not"

the 
contradiction  marked  X2,  when

"examining  the  appellant.  Although  he  said  in  his  evidence  that  he"
"consumed liquor heavily on that day, contradiction marked X2 shows"
"that he had told the police, when making a statement that he did not"
"consume  alcohol,  since  it  was  a  Poya  day.  Due  to  this  significant"
"discrepancy between his testimony and his statement to the police, his"
"evidence  on 
intoxication 
is  not  credible  and  cannot  be  accepted."
"Furthermore, there is no other evidence to imply or establish that the"
"appellant was so intoxicated that he couldn't understand what he was"
"doing. Therefore, the defence of intoxication fails."
"I

"offence, as he very much loved the baby, the learned Deputy Solicitor"
"General  contended  that  the  appellant  had  never  been  a  loving  father"
"because when the PW1 requested the appellant to return the baby as"
"she wanted to nurse the baby and she found it difficult to wait without"
"nursing the baby, the appellant had replied by asking PW1 to cut off"
"her nipples. The said item of evidence given by the PW1 has never been"
"challenged in cross-examination. Not only that, the unchallenged item"
"of  evidence  of  the  PW1  reveals  that  when  the  baby  was  killed  in  the"
"Thekkawatte, the appellant told PW1 to come to Thekkawatte and pick"
"up the baby. Therefore, I agree with the contention of the learned DSG"
"that  the  appellant  does  not  appear  to  be  a  loving  father  to  the  baby."
"Hence, I hold that no reasonable doubt would be created on the basis"
"that the appellant being a loving father would not commit this offence."
