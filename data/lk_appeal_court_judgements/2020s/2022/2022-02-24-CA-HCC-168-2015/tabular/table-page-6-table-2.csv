"action desired a fresh trial.”"
"It is clear from the appeal under review that except for the evidence of PW-01,"
"the rest of the evidence had been led before the learned High Court Judge who"

"further hearing of evidence on 24-12-2012, the appellant has been represented"
"by  the  same  Counsel  who  appeared  for  him  previously.  The  case  record  bear"

"given circumstances."

"with a trial."
"As  discussed  earlier,  the  main  part  of  section  48  provides  for  a  succeeding"
"judge  to  re-summon  a  witness  and  commence  the  proceedings  afresh  if  the"
"judge  thinks  fit,  which  is  applicable  to  either  civil  or  criminal  matters  at  the"
"discretion of the judge."
