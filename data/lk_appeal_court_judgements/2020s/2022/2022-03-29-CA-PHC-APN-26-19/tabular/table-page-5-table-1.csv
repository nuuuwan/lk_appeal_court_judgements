"the  argument  and  there  had  been  an  exchange  of  fisticuffs,  which  had  later"
"developed to a brawl in which the deceased has sustained the fatal injury along"
"with six other injuries."
"According to the evidence the 1st accused had stabbed the deceased and the 7th"
"and the 9th accused had come to the scene with clubs."
"The deceased had sustained 7 injuries and the 3rd had been the fatal blow which"
"had been caused to the chest and which had been classified as being necessarily"
"fatal by the doctor, the others had been contusions and abrasions."
"The Counsel appearing for the petitioners cited the case of Kumara vs. Attorney"
"General 2003 1 SLR 139 where reduction of sentence has been considered."
"The  state  counsel  stated  that  the  deceased  had  been  isolated  and  assaulted  by"
"the accused,  and  furthermore he was assaulted and stabbed while being fallen."
"The  state  Counsel  also  submitted  that  the  petitioners  had  come  by  way  of"
"revision  when  the  right  of  appeal  has  been  available  and  no  reasons  had  been"
"given."
"Upon  perusal  of  the  petition  of  appeal  this  Court  observes  that  the  petitioners"
"have  given  reasons  for  not  filing  an  appeal  although  common  it  might  be  the"
"reasons stated. But as the petitioners are not canvassing the conviction but only"
"the  sentence  this  Court  would  except  those  reasons  to  be  exceptional  and  also"
"since there is no obvious delay in filling the revision application."
"In  view  of  the  submissions  made  by  both  parties  this  Court  observes  that  the"
"whole  incident  has  commenced  on  the  instigation  of  the  deceased  which  both"
"parties  agree  to,  and  in  the  said  brawl  the  stabbing  of  the  deceased  had  taken"
"place."
