"and said that the number should be 686802 and the weapon is one Smith Yard revolver of .38"
"Calibre.  The  prosecution  sought  permission  to  mark  a  document  from  the  PR  book  as  පැ  2."
"However, it is not in the record whether such a document was marked or whether පැ 2 refers to"
"PR 197 at all."
"Sergeant Hemachandra failed to give any evidence on the issue of whether he handed over to"
"anyone the production so taken over from IP Fonseka. At this, the prosecution fails to offer any"
"cogent, comprehensive uncontradictory evidence to prove the continuous and undeserved chain"
"of production."
"Sergeant  Rodrigo  10598  (PW  5)  (Inspector  at  the  time  he  gave  evidence)  gave  evidence  of  a"
"parcel  taken  over  by  him  from  an  officer  at  reserve  duty  however,  he  could  not  name  from"
"whom, at what time the said parcel was taken over to be delivered to the Government Analyst."
"His evidence was referred to in PR 200/08. According to Rodrigo, he could name the list of items"
"he took over under PR 200/08 by reference to a report prepared for the Magistrate to obtain"
"permission to produce them to the Government Analyst."
"The  item  recovered from  the  appellant  was  one  revolver  bearing No.  18855/  686800 and  six"
"cartridges of the same caliber. In view of the above evidence, it is clear that the prosecution has"
"failed  to  establish  the  production  chain  particularly  between  Sergeant  Hemachandra  and"
"Sergeant Rodrigo and in documents between PR 197 and PR 200/08. However, the Learned Trial"
"Judge in his Judgment has drawn a fatal inference that it was the production related to the trial"
"that was taken over by Sergeant Rodrigo on 02.04.1998, on PR 200/ 08, whereas there was no"
"evidence offered by the prosecution to prove that Sergeant Hemachandra handed over anything"
"relevant to this case to anyone let alone Sergeant Rodrigo."
"This  was  a  trial  conducted  in  absentia.  In  the  course  of the  oral  argument,  an argument  was"
"advanced on behalf of the appellant challenging the order of the learned Trial Judge, to have"
"fixed the trial in absentia. It is significant to note in the instant case that the appellant who had"
"furnished the appellate brief to the respondent has failed to furnish the respondent with any of"
"the journal entries and some parts of the proceedings. As per the date stamp or the indictment,"
"the High Court of Negombo received it on 09.09.1998. In the absence of the journal entries and"
"the initial proceedings, it is difficult to understand the date of issue of notice or the accused and"
"the date on which notice was returnable. However, proceedings were available for perusal from"
"28.05.2001 to 13.06.2001 revealing that the accused had been absent during this period."
"The  accused  had  been  present  in  court  on  25.06.2001  &  12.11.2001.  Thereafter  21.01.2002"
"being yet another date on which the accused-appellant was present, he had been represented"
"by  a  counsel.  On  20.05.2002  the  accused  had  been  absent  and  his  counsel  had  submitted  a"
"Medical Certificate."
"Thereafter  from  01.07.2002  onwards,  the  accused  had  not  appeared  in  court  and  the  legal"
"representation  also  stopped.  Having  led  the  evidence  of  the  police  officer  on  the  inability  to"
"execute the warrant on the accused-appellant, prosecution made an application on 11.07.2005"
"to fix the trial in absentia. Being satisfied with the evidence placed before the court on the non-"
"availability  of  the  accused  person,  on  11.07.2005  the  learned  Trial  Judge  ordered  the  trial  to"
"proceed  in  absentia.  Thereafter,  the  trial finally  commenced  against  the  accused-appellant  in"
"absentia on 13.07.2009."
