"In terms of section 241(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979' the trial of any"
"person  on  indictment  with  or  without  a  jury  may  commence  and  proceed  or  continue  in  his"
"absence if the court is satisfied. The Court takes this decision considering any of the following"
"instances;"
"(i.) 
Section 241(1)(a) wino the indictment has been served"
"(ii.) 
Section 241(1)(b) when it has not been possible to serve the indictment on him."
"In the absence of any journal entries and part of the proceedings, it is difficult to state under"
"which  limb  the  instant  case  would  fall.  However,  having  arrived  at  the  conclusion  that  the"
"accused deliberately avoids attending court, a trial in absentia was ordered. The limited material"
"available  demonstrates 
the  presence  of 
the  accused  before 
the 
court  and  his 
legal"
"representation.  His  counsel  had  requested  material 
in  terms  of  Regulation  14(5)  of  the"
"Emergency Regulation."
"When an experienced counsel requested relevant material in terms of Regulation 14(5) of the"
"Emergency  Regulations,  he  did  so  only  with  the  awareness  of  the  charge  framed  against  the"
"accused person. On the other hand, a counsel would not just stop at requesting the documents"
"for which the accused-appellant becomes eligible as provided under the Emergency Regulations,"
"but also would have demanded the service of the Indictment had it not been received by  his"
"client.  Nowhere 
in  the  proceedings, 
including  the  Petition  of  Appeal,  non-receipt  of  the"
"indictment is taken up. In paragraph 2 of the petition, the accused has admitted his arraignment"
"by Court."
"All  these  circumstances  point  towards  the  fact  that  the  indictment  had  been  served  on  the"
"accused-appellant hence, the instant case falls under section 241(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure"
"Code where he absconds after the service of the indictment. The circumstances qualify this case"
"under section 241(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Considering the attendant factors, on"
"behalf  of  the  respondent,  it  was  argued  that  the  decision  of  the  learned  Trial  Judge  was  in"
"accordance with the law."
"On 08.03.2011 whilst the case was proceeding in absentia, attorney-at-law Mr. Ariyaratne had"
"submitted  a  letter  alleged  to  have  been  sent  by  the  accused  and  requested  permission  to"
"intervene  in  the  case  and  defend  the  interest  of  the  accused-appellant.  In  support  of  his"
"application  few  letters  were  submitted.  The  said  letter  does  not  provide  the  address  of  the"
"accused person in Japan. The sheet of paper used to write this letter is a paper that is commonly"
"available  anywhere  in the  world  including  Sri  Lanka.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the  respondent"
"submitted that neither the letter nor the application of the counsel reveal how the accused had"
"made  contact  with  the  said  attorney-at-law.  The  application  of  the  learned  Counsel does  not"
"reveal that he has any personal knowledge of or contact with the accused person and the counsel"
"does not reveal that he is familiar with the handwriting of the accused-appellant."
"Learned Counsel for the respondent argued that  the alleged signature in the letter is a name"
"simply written which does not carry any uniqueness in the signature hence the possibility of any"
"person placing it cannot be overruled. He further says that the pattern of writing in the letter is"
"different to the pattern of writing in the signature and the counsel had failed to attribute any"
"reasons to satisfy the court that he was familiar with the signature of the accused person."
