"The accused-appellant preferred this appeal against the said conviction and sentences.",""
"The grounds of appeal are as follows;",""
"i.","The learned High Court Judge misdirected with regard to the admissibility of the"
"","evidence  against  the  1st  and  the  3rd  counts  when  there  is  no  proof  against  the"
"","accused appellant and thereby the conviction against the 1st and the 3rd counts are"
"","bad in Law."

Judge  misdirected  herself  by 
failure 
to 
consider 
that"

"","ingredients of the 2nd count and therefore the conviction against the 2nd count is"
"","bad in Law"
"iii.","Learned Trial Judge misdirected herself by failure to appreciate the version of the"
"","doctor  in  par  with  rest  of  the  prosecution  witnesses  which  clearly  conflicts  the"

"","prosecution case"
"iv.","The  learned  High  Court  Judge  misdirected  herself  by  failure  to  evaluate  all  the"
