"Appellant  says  that  learned  Trial  Judge  who  delivered  the  judgment  has  arrived  at  her"
"conclusion based on materials that are not accurate or rather not given in the course of the"
"proceedings."
"She heavily relied on recovery of a sledgehammer that had been used to cause the head injury"
"on  the  deceased.  It  was  the  position  of  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  that  subsequent  to"
"arrest of the accused, on his directions, the sledgehammer was recovered underneath a tree"
"in the garden of the house when the incident happened. It was the evidence that police officer"
"recovered the sledgehammer from the owner of the said sledgehammer which had been used"
"to put up huts for the wedding function."
"Further he stated that the photographs taken by the SOCO officers when they commenced"
"the investigation helped him to recover sledgehammer. The accused appellant was arrested"
"09.11.2014 nearly 6 months subsequent to the incident according to police  witnesses. The"
"accused only had shown a coconut tree 120 feet away from the house. The sledgehammer"
"that had been brought by one Anura was taken into custody. Therefore, when the Learned"
"High  Court  Judge  asserted  that  the  sledgehammer  was  recovered  on  the  direction  of  the"
"accused  appellant  is  a  misdirection  and  there  by  the  conviction  based  on  surmises  and"
"conjecture."
"Another  argument  raised  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  was  that  Learned  High"
"Court Judge completely misdirected herself while concluding that, the accused appellant has"
"entered the house can be determined based on doctor's evidence and DNA evidence, which"
"is completely misdirection of facts. The Learned High Court Judge concluded that the defence"
"has not challenged the position that he entered the house which is also a complete fallacy"
"since prosecution at no point of time proved the accused appellant entered the house with"
"positive evidence."
"Learned Counsel for the appellant says that when doctor has not mentioned anything to the"
"effect that the deceased was raped on her bed inside the room, the Learned High Court Judge"
"concluded that doctor has opined so when giving evidence."
"He further argued that the learned High Court Judge misdirected herself by surmising rather"
"assuming without a proper basis that accused appellant entered the house when the mother"
"of the deceased and the deceased came out of the house for call of nature at which point a"
"person  can  have  an  opportunity  to  enter  the  house.  There  is  no  conclusive  evidence  to"
"establish that accused-appellant actually entered the house in the absence of any direct or"
"circumstantial evidence to that effect."
"On  behalf  of  the  appellant,  it  was  further  submitted  that  the  learned  High  Court  judge"
"completely misdirected herself by concluding that there is a high probability that the doors"
"were not closed due to tiredness after the wedding function even though witness testified"
"and said they closed the door. When there is evidence to seal the position that they close the"
"door after returning from the toilet and it is contradictory to the conclusion arrived earlier"
"mentioned in the same page of the judgment. The learned High Court  Judge extended her"
"presumption that accused appellant has an opportunity to see the deceased and the mother"
"going out of the house for call of nature and at that point he has possibly entered the house."
