"In the case of Ridge v. Baldwin2 Lord Denning held that,"
"“breach of the principles of natural justice renders the decision voidable and not null"
"and void ab initio. An administrative official or tribunal exercising a quasi – judicial"
"power is bound to comply with the principles of natural justice. i.e. to comply with the"
"rules of audi altera partem and nemo judex in causa sua. A quasi- judicial decision may"
"involve finding of facts and it affects the rights of a person. Sometimes such decisions"
"involve matters of law and facts or even purely matters of law.”"
