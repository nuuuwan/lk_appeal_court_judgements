"Even  where  a  servant  is  in  possession  over  property  belonging  to  his  master,  on  his"
"behalf, the possession will become his own when he continues possession after leaving"
"the service of his master, or even otherwise.  His possession, therefore,  even though"
"wrongful,  will  be  maintained  if  it  has  continued  for  over  two  months  prior  to  the"
"institution of the proceedings."
