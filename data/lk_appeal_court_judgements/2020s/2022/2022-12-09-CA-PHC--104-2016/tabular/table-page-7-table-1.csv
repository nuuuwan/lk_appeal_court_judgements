"Act, the main point for decision is the actual  possession  of  the  land  on  the"
"date    of  the  filing  of  the  information  under  Section  66;  but,    where  forcible"
"dispossession  took  place  within  two  months  before the date on which the"
"said information was filed the main point is actual possession prior to that alleged"
"date of dispossession.”"
"“Under Section 68, the Judge is bound to maintain the possession of such person"
"even  if  he  be  a  rank  trespasser  as  against  any  interference  even  by  the  rightful"
"owner.  This  Section  entitles  even  a  squatter  to  the  protection  of  law,  unless  his"
"possession was acquired within two months of the filing of the  information. That"
"person is entitled to possession until he is evicted by a due process of law. A Judge"
"should therefore in an inquiry under Part VII of the aforesaid Act, confine himself to"
"the question of actual possession on the date of filing the information except in a"
"case where a person who had been in possession of the land had been dispossessed"
"within a period of two months immediately before the date of the information. He"
"is  not  to  decide  any  question  of  title  or  right  to  possession  of  the  parties  to  the"
"land”. (emphasis added)"
