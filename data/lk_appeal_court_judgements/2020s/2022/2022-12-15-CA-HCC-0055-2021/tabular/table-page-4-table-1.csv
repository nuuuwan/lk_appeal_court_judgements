"","submitted 
that,  the 
learned  High  Court  Judge 
in  his"
"","judgment  has  wrongly 
considered 
some 
evidence  as"
"","unchallenged. It is observed that, the learned High Court"
"","Judge was right in observing some facts as unchallenged."
"","Those  facts  were,  the  place  in  which  the  victim  resided,"
"","the fact that her mother has been working elsewhere and"
"","has  been  coming  home  once  or  twice  a  month,  the  fact"
"","that  the  PW1  has  been  residing  with  her  sister  and  her"
"","father,  the  fact that  she  had  been  studying in grade 5 in"
"","the year 2009 and the fact that the father of the PW1 has"
"","been  cooking  meals  for  the  children  daily  and  has  been"
"","working  as  a 
labourer.  These 
facts  were  elicited 
in"
"","evidence and were unchallenged."
"5.","The learned Counsel further submitted that, the PW1 has"
"","failed 
to 
inform 
the  officers  who  audio  recorded  her"
"","statement  that  her  clothes  were  removed  or  the  fact  that"
"","her  skirt  was  lifted  when  the  appellant  committed  the"
"","sexual acts  on  her.  However,  as rightly  submitted  by  the"
"","learned  State  Counsel  for  the  respondent,  the  fact  that"
"","the PW1 failed to mention in her statement as to whether"
"","her  clothes  were  removed  or  lifted  when  the  sexual  act"
"","was  committed  will  not  affect  her  credibility.  The  above"
"","omission  does  not  go  to  the  root  of  the  matter,  and"
"","therefore,  will  not  be  a  reason  to  reject  or  doubt  the"
"","testimony of the child victim."
"6.","The  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  further  submitted"
"","that,  the  complaint  to  the  police  has  been  made  eleven"
"","months later. It was further submitted that, although the"
"","PW1 
in  her  evidence  has  said  that  she 
informed  her"
"","father  about  the  incident,  the  father  has  stated  that  he"
"","got to know about this incident from a friend. Upon being"
"","questioned  by  the  police  sergeant  Chithra  of  the  Child"
"","Protection Authority, the PW1 has stated that she told her"
"","father about the incident in which she was abused on the"
"","floor. However, the PW1’s evidence suggests that she has"
"","initially  avoided  or  has  been  reluctant  in  informing  her"
"","father about the incidents. Her father’s position was that,"
