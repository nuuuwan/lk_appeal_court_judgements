"However,  the  accused  should  not  be  deprived  of  a  fair"
"trial.  This  aspect  was  sufficiently  discussed  in  case  of  R."
"V. Dossi, 13 Cr.App.R.158."
"""In  Dossi 
(supra), 
it  was  held 
that  a  date"
"specified 
in  an 
indictment 
is  not  a  material  matter"
"unless it is an essential part of the alleged offence; the"
"defendant  may  be  convicted  although  the  jury  finds"
"that  the  offence  was  committed  on  a  date  other  than"
"that  specified 
in 
the 
indictment.  Amendment  of  the"
"indictment 
is  unnecessary,  although 
it  will  be  good"
"practice  to  do  so  (provided  that  there  is  no  prejudice,"
