"The Appellant is a limited liability company approved by the Board of Investment"
"of Sri Lanka since 30th March 1998 to engage in sawing and polishing diamonds for re-"
"export. The transaction on which this dispute arose concerns diamonds sent by Grossman"
"Diamond Manufacturing, situated in Belgium, to Colandiam (Pvt) Ltd., another company"
"in  Sri  Lanka  approved  by  the  Board  of  Investment  of  Sri  Lanka,  to  do  sawing  and"
"polishing services. Colandiam forwards the diamonds to Brooky Diamond for the purpose"
"of sawing."
"The Assessor refused to accept the Value Added Tax (VAT) returns submitted by"
"the  Appellant  for  the  taxable  period  (01st  April  2005  to  31St  January  2009-  forty-six"
"months)  on  the  basis  that  the  Appellant is liable to  pay  VAT  on  the  sawing  services  it"
"provided locally to Colandiam."
"This Court will first determine the main issues which are whether sawing services"
"rendered by Brooky Diamond to Grossman Diamond are entitled to zero-rate of tax and"
"the issue of compliance with Section 29 of the Value Added Tax Act. Thereafter, it will set"
"out its opinion in respect of the eighteen questions of law transmitted by the Tax Appeals"
"Commission."
"1.  Entitlement to ‘zero-rate’ in terms of Section 7(1)(c) of the Value Added Tax Act."
"Taxable goods or services  supplied in Sri Lanka and  consumed or utilized outside"
"Sri Lanka by persons outside Sri Lanka are  eligible to VAT at zero rate of tax. Section"
"7(2) of the Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002, as amended, provides that no tax shall be"
"charged in respect of such supply and the supply shall in all other respects be treated as"
"a taxable supply, and accordingly the rate at which tax is charged on the supply shall be"
"zero."
