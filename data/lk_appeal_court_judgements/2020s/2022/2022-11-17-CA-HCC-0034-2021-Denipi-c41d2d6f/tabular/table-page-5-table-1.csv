"6.","The  learned  President’s  Counsel further contented that,"
"","the time of offence that is mentioned in the charge is in"
"","year  2004.  However,  the  evidence  was  led  on  sexual"
"","offences committed by the appellant in the year 2007 as"
"","well  as  years  other 
than  2004  which  has 
caused"
"","prejudice 
to 
the  appellant.  The 
learned  President’s"
"","Counsel further submitted that, the defence of alibi that"
"","was  taken  up  by  the  appellant  in  his  evidence  has  not"
"","been taken into consideration by the learned High Court"
"","Judge."
"7.","The  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG)  submitted"
"","that, the delay on the part of the victim in revealing the"
"","sexual acts committed by the appellant is well explained"
"","and  justified  in  the  given  circumstances.  In  that,  the"
"","learned  DSG  submitted 
that,  even  after 
the  police"
"","officers  have  recorded  the  statements  from  the  victim"
"","(PW1), the authorities did not take any step to place the"
"","victim  elsewhere.  They  continued  to  keep  her 
in  the"
"","same home. The learned DSG further submitted that, no"
"","defence of alibi was put to the PW1 by the defence when"
"","the  PW1  gave  evidence. 
It 
is 
the  contention  of 
the"
"","learned  DSG  that,  no  prejudice  has  been  caused  to  the"
"","appellant even though the evidence was led with regard"
"","to 
the  offence  committed 
in 
the  year  2007,  as 
the"
"","prosecution  has 
to 
lead  such  evidence 
to  prove 
the"
"","circumstances  under  which  these  sexual  offences  were"
"","brought to light."
"8.","According 
to 
the 
victim 
(PW1), 
she 
had 
been"
"","continuously  raped  by  the  appellant  until  March  2007,"
"","including  the  year  2004.  However,  she  has 
failed  to"
"","make  any  complaint 
to 
the  authorities  until  March"
"","2007.  That  was  also  when  the  probation  officer  Niluka"
"","(PW3) 
came 
to 
the 
home 
to 
investigate 
into 
an"
"","anonymous  complaint  regarding  child  abuse.  When  the"
"","victim  was  asked to put  down her  complaint  in  writing,"
"","she  has  only  written  about  the  sexual  offence  that  was"
"","committed  against  her  on  5th  March  2007,  the  day  in"
"","which  the  opening  ceremony  of  the new  building  at  the"
