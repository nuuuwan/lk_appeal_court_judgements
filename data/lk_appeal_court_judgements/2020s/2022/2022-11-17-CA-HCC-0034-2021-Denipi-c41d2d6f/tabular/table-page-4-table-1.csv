"","neither  in  her  first  statement  nor  in  her  letter  that  she"
"","wrote  and  gave  Niluka  has  she  mentioned  about  her"
"","being  abused  in  2004.  She  has  only  mentioned  about"
"","the incident that took place on the 25th March 2007."
"4.","The appellant gave sworn evidence in Court denying the"
"","charge. It was his position that, in the year 2004 he did"
"","not  even  serve  at 
the  Dhamma  School  as  he  was"
"","following a course at CINEC campus from 2002 onwards"
"","(page 340 of the appeal brief)."
"5.","The  grounds  of  appeal  no.  1,  2  and  3  will  be  discussed"
"","together."
"","The 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for 
the 
appellant"
"","submitted  that,  there  was  no  direct  complaint  made  by"
"","the child victim but  in fact  it was the probation  officers"
"","who have initiated the investigation on their own. It was"
"","the  contention  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  that,"
"","the  letter  that  was  said  to  have  been  written  by  the"
"","victim,  which  was  marked  as 
‘P-1’  was  a  document"
"","prepared  by  another  and  not  of  her  own.  The  learned"
"","President’s  Counsel  further  submitted  that,  the  witness"
"","Niluka  (PW3)  who  obtained  the  letter  from  the  victim"
"","said in her evidence that, she could not identify if the ‘P-"
"","1’ 
contained 
the 
victim’s 
handwriting. 
The  main"
"","argument that was advanced by the learned President’s"
"","Counsel was that, the victim herself has failed to make a"
"","complaint to the authorities. It was his contention that,"
"","even  in  her  first  statement  to  the  police,  she  has  only"
"","mentioned  about  the  sexual  offence  committed  against"
"","her by the appellant in the year 2007. Therefore, it was"
"","his  contention  that,  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  prove"
"","that  the  child  victim  was  sexually  abused  in  the  year"
"","2004  which  is  the  period  specified  in  the  indictment."
"","The victim has even failed to inform the JMO when she"
"","first gave the short history to him that she was raped in"
"","the year 2004, as specified in the charge."
