"appellant admits by the said suggestion that a team of police officers"
"came  to  his  house  for  a  raid,  the  vehicle  that  was  used  to  reach  the"
"place of the raid would not be an issue."
"A
nother argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant"
"was  that  there  was  a  possibility  of  implicating  the  appellant  for  the"
"heroin  found  in  someone  else's  custody,  especially  because  a  body"
"search  was  not  done  even  on  the  driver  of  the  private  van  to  ensure"
"that he did not possess any heroin. I regret that I am unable to accept"
"that  argument  because  the  defence  of  implicating  the  appellant  for"
"heroin  recovered 
from  anybody  else  or 
introducing  heroin  to  the"
"appellant was not taken by the appellant at any stage of the trial. The"
"learned  counsel  who  appeared  for the  appellant  in  the  High  Court"
"made no suggestion to any of the prosecution witnesses of introducing"
"heroin  or 
implicating  the  appellant 
for  the  heroin  recovered 
from"
"someone  else.  Even  in  his  dock  statement,  the  appellant  has  not"
"stated  that  the  heroin  was  introduced  or  that  he  was  implicated  for"
"the heroin recovered from someone else. At the hearing of the appeal,"
"the learned counsel for the appellant also admitted that the appellant"
"had  not 
taken 
the  said  defence 
in 
the  High  Court 
trial. 
In 
the"
"circumstances,  the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  was  not  obliged  to"
"consider  the  issue  of  implication.  Also,  in  the  absence  of  any  such"
"defence, I hold that  the possibility of implication was not an issue to"
"be considered by the learned High Court Judge."
"W
hen  PW-1 
looked 
inside  the  house  from  the  space  between  the"
"wooden  boards,  he  saw  the  appellant  sitting  on  the  bed,  packing"
"heroin  into  cellophane  bags.  When  one  of  the  police  officers  knocked"
"on the door, the appellant stated he was suffering from tuberculosis,"
"and  then PC  Senarath  pushed  the  door  open  and  went  inside  the"
"house.  PW-1  stated  that  there  were  5  cellophane  bags  containing  40"
"heroin  packets  each,  when  the  police  officers  entered  the  house.  The"
"learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  pointed  out  a  contradiction  that"
