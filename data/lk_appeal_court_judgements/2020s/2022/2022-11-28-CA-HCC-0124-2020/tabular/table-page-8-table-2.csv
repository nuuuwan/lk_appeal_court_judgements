"considered as corroboration."
"In the case of Sana Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka (2009) 1 SLR 48, it was held:"
"1.  “The corroborative facts and evidence must proceed from someone other"
"than  the  witness  to  be  corroborated.  This  means  that  his  previous"
"statements,  even  when  admissible  cannot  be  used  to  corroborate  him,"
"as  such  as  proof  of  a  complaint  in  a  sexual  case  or  a  previous  act  of"
"identification  is  not  corroborative  of  the  evidence  of  the  witness,  even"
"though  by  showing  consistency,  it  can  to  some  extent  strengthen  his"
"credibility.”"
