"F
or a matter to be sent for a re-trial, there must be evidence which shows that"
"the prosecution has a strong prima facie case to be tried for the second time. A"
"case  should  not  be  sent  for  a  re-trial  for  the  prosecution  to  lead  evidence  to"
"cover the deficiencies in the evidence led at the first trial."
"In this matter, the sequence of events mentioned in the three counts have been"
"on the basis that the 1st incident was an incident where the appellant used his"
"penis between the thighs of  the victim  as I have stated before. The  reason for"
"mentioning  the  sequence  of  events 
in  the  three  counts  mentioned 
in  the"
"indictment  may  have  been  decided  on  the  basis  of  the  statement  made  to  the"
"police by the victim. However, in giving evidence in Court, the victim describes"
"the  1st 
incident 
faced  by  him  as  the  appellant  placing  the  victim’s  penis"
"between the appellant’s thighs and engaging in sexual abuse. This description"
"of  the  incident  is  in  complete  contrast  to  the  relevant  1st  charge  against  the"
"appellant."
"In  the  judgement,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  in  considering  the  evidence"
"placed before the Court in relation to the 1st count has reproduced the relevant"
"questions  and  answers  at  page  11  (page  232  of  the  appeal  brief).  However,"
"rather  than  considering  whether  this  evidence  was  sufficient  to  conclude  that"
"the 1st count preferred against the appellant has been proved, the learned High"
"Court  Judge  has  merely  proceeded  to  convict  the  appellant  on  the  1st  count"
"when there was no evidence placed before Court in that regard."
"As contended correctly by the learned Counsel for the appellant, the sequence"
"of  events  alleged  to  have  taken  place  becomes  very  much  relevant  when"
"considering the charges preferred against the appellant and the evidence by the"
"victim in Court."
"The 2nd event of sexual abuse that has taken place according to the indictment"
"was an incident where the appellant alleged to have had oral sex on the victim."
"But in giving evidence in Court, the victim has stated that the 2nd incident was"
"an incident where the appellant had anal sex with him."
