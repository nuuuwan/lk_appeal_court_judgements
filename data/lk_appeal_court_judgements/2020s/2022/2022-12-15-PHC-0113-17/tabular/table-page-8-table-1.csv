"In view of the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the grounds of appeal raised"
"on behalf of the Appellant are without merit, thus, the appeal has to be dismissed."
"As such, we are not inclined to interfere with the Order dated 27.07.2007 of the learned"
"Magistrate and the Order dated 16.03.2017 by the learned High Court Judge."
"Hence, the impugned Orders are affirmed and the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed"
"at Rs.25,000/-."
