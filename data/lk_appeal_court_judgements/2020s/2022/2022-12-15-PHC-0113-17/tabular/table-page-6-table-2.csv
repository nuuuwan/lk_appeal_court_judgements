"In this  instance,  Court draws the  attention to  the case  of  Muhandiram  Vs.  Chairman  JEDB"
"reported in [1992] 1 S.L.R 110 where Grero, J. held that;"
"“In an inquiry under the State Lands  (Recovery of Possession) Act, the onus is on the"
"person  summoned  to  establish  his  possession  or  occupation  that  it  is  possessed  or"
"occupied upon a valid permit or other written authority of the state grant according to"
"any written Law-if this burden is not discharged, the only option open to the Magistrate"
"is to order ejectment.”"
