"The  position  taken  by  the  Respondent  was  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"correctly  evaluated  the  Order  of  the  learned  Magistrate  and  the  Appellant  had  not"
"shown any exceptional circumstances exist to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the"
"Provincial High Court of Ratnapura."
"It is seen that the Appellant had not challenged the Order of the learned Magistrate"
"dated 27.07.2007 instead had taken the objection that statement of objections should"
"be  rejected  since  the  Respondent  had  not  filed  an  affidavit  with  the  statement  of"
"objections and that accordingly, relief prayed in the prayer to the petition filed in the"
"Provincial High Court should have been granted."
"In this respect, it was submitted by the Respondent that since the application to the"
"High Court by the Appellant is an application for revision, even if no objection had been"
"filed and there had been no appearance, the Appellant was not entitled to relief unless"
"the Court granted relief in extraordinary circumstances."
"The case Gita Fonseka vs. Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka [2004]"
"(1)  SLR  149  was  cited  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant.  In  this  case,  affidavit  was  filed"
"without  a  statement  of  objection  and  the  Court  held  that  Rule  3(7)  had  not  been"
"complied with."
"However,  in  the  case  at  hand,  statement  of  objections  had  been  filed  without  an"
"affidavit.  In  this  instance,  it  is  worthy  to  note  Rule  3(7)  of  the  Court  of  Appeal"
"(Appellate Procedure) Rules."
