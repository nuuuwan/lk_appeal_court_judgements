"The criteria are whether the service is rendered to any person or partnership"
"outside Sri Lanka. In the circumstances, I am in favour of the argument"
"advanced by the learned President’s Counsel for the Respondent that the"
"two statutory provisions cannot be compared."
"The  Assessor,  in  his  reasons  for  not  accepting  the  return  refers  to  a"
"duplicity in the payment of Income Tax by ASTL. He observed that prior"
"to 
the  year  of  assessment  2010/2011  ASTL  paid 
income 
tax  at 
the"
"concessionary  rate  of  15%  in  terms  of  Section  46  of  the  IR  Act  and"
"thereafter,  claimed  exemption  under  Section  13  (dddd).  In  reply,  the"
"Respondent 
submitted 
that  Section  13 
(dddd)  was 
introduced  by"
"amendment Act No. 19 of 2009 with effect from 31st of March 2009 and"
"thereafter only ASTL could claim the exemption under Section 13 (dddd)."
"I  am  inclined  to  accept  the  explanation  offered  by  the  Respondent  and"
"therefore, 
the  Assessor’s  observation 
that 
there 
is  a  duplicity 
in 
tax"
"treatment by ASTL has no merit."

"(Achala  Wengappuli  J.,  agreeing)  held  that  it  is  the  FTO  who  provide"
"services to the foreign tourists by organizing their tour in Sri Lanka.  In"
"order  to  fulfil  the  obligation  undertaken  by  the  foreign  tour  operator,  it"
"receives  the  service  of  the  Respondent  and  in  turn  the  foreign  tourists"
"receive the service from the Respondent."
"Thus, for the reasons enunciated above in this judgement, I would prefer"
"to  follow  the  judgment  of  His  Lordship  Justice  Janak  De  Silva  in  the"
"aforementioned case of CGIR v. Aitken Spence Travels Limited8."
"For the reasons set out above, I hold that the TAC did not err in law when"
"it arrived at the conclusion that it did."
"Accordingly, I answer the questions of law stated for the opinion of this"
"Court as follows:"
