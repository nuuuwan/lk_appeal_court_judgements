"a
ccused brother-in-law lived in the same land.  Therefore, the witness was very"
"familiar with the voice of the accused.  In that case, Sisira de Abrew J. quoted"
"the following from the Indian case of  Kirpal Singh vs the State of Uthur Pradesh"
"1965 AIR,  712."
"“It is true that the evidence about identification of a person by the timbre of his"
"voice  depending  upon  subtle  variations 
in 
the  overtones  when 
the  person"
"recognising is not familiar with the person recognised may be somewhat risky in"
"a criminal trial. But the appellant was intimately known to Rakkha Singh and for"
"more than a fortnight before the date of the offence he had met the appellant on"
"several  occasions 
in  connection  with  the  dispute  about  the  sugarcane  crop."
"Rakkha Singh bad heard the appellant and his brothers calling Karam Singh to"
"come  out  of  the  hut  and  had  also  heard  the  appellant,  as  a  prelude  to  the"
"shooting  referring  to  the  dispute  about  sugarcane.  In  the  examination,  in-chief"
"Rakkha  Singh  has  deposed  as 
if  he  had  seen 
the  actual  assault  by 
the"
"appellant, but in cross-examination he stated that he had not seen the face of the"
"assailant  of  Karam  Singh.  He  asserted  however  that  he  was  able  to  recognize"
"the  appellant  and  his  two  brothers  from  their  'gait  and  voice'.  It  cannot  be  said"
"that  identification  of  the  assailant  by  Rakkha  Singh,  from  what  he  heard  and"
"observed  was so  improbable  that  we  would be justified  in disagreeing  with  the"
"opinion  of  the  Court  which  saw  the  witness  and  formed  its  opinion  as  to  his"
"credibility  and  of  the  High  Court  which  considered  the  evidence  against  the"
"appellant and accepted the testimony.”"
"In  this  case,  as  per  the  evidence  of  PW1,  the  appellant  was  not  a  person"
"intimately  known  to  PW1.    PW1  did  not  have  sufficient  opportunity  to  be"
"familiar  with  the  voice  of  the  appellant.    The  purported  identification  of  the"
"appellant by PW1 is therefore not safe and reliable.  I am  of the view that the"
"identity  of  the  perpetrator 
is  not  established  beyond  reasonable  doubt  by"
"cogent and affirmative evidence."
