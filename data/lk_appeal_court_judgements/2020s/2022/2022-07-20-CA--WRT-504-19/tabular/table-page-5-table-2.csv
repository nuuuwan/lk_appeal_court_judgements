".N.G.Fernando C.J. in Municipal Council Colombo vs Munasinghe3 observed as"
"follows:"
"""I  hold  that  when  the  Industrial  Disputes  Act  confers  on  an  Arbitrator  the"
"discretion to make an award  which is 'just and equitable', the Legislature"
"did  not  intend  to  confer  on  an  Arbitrator  the  freedom  of  a  wild  horse.  An"
"award must be 'just and equitable' as between the parties to a dispute; and"
"the  fact  that  one  party  might  have  encountered  'hard  times'  because  of"
"personal circumstances for which the other party is in no way responsible"
"is not a ground on which justice or equity requires the other party to make"
"undue concessions. In addition, it is time that this Court should correct what"
"seems to be a prevalent misconception. The mandate which the Arbitrator in"
"an industrial dispute holds under the law requires him to make an award"
"which is just and equitable, and not necessarily an award which favours an"
"employee. An Arbitrator holds no licence from the Legislature to make any"
"such  award  as  he  may  please,  for  nothing  is  just  and  equitable  which  is"
"decided by whim or caprice or by the toss of a double-headed coin.‚Äù"
