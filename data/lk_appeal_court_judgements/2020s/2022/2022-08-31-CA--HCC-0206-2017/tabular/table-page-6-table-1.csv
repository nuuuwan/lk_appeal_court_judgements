"According to Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance, “No particular number"
"of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact”."
"This section of the Evidence Ordinance clearly lays down that no particular"
"number of witnesses are required to prove or disprove the facts of the case."
"This section applies to both civil and criminal cases. This section is based"
"on  the  popular  maxim  that  evidence  is  to  be  weighed  and  not  counted."
"There  is  no  rule  of  law  that  the  unsubstantiated  testimony  cannot  be"
"accepted.  The  rule  is  of  prudence  and  whether  it  is  to  be  adopted  or  not"
"depends  on 
the  circumstances  of  each  case.  When 
the  Courts  are"
"ascertaining the truth, the number of witnesses is not considered, but the"
"quality of the evidence is taken into serious consideration."
"In  this  case  PW1  had  organised  the  raid  after  receiving  the  information"
"from  a  police  officer  attached 
to 
the  Special 
Investigation  Bureau  of"
"Kalpitiya  Police  Station.  Initially,  the  group  of  police  officers  travelled  in  a"
"van  up  to  Katunayake  and  the  team  split  into  two  thereafter.  PW1  had"
"travelled 
in 
the  official  car  of  ASP/Srilal 
from  Katunayake  and  PW2"
"IP/Bogamuwa  took  charge  of  the  remaining  group  in  the  van.  Hence,  two"
"vehicles had been used to conduct the raid in the present case."
"Firstly,  PW1  had  met  the  informant  who  had  given  information  to  the"
"officer at Kalpitiya Police Station. Through him they were introduced to the"
"second  informer  Sadha  and  the  raid  was  conducted  upon  the  information"
"provided by Sadha. Following the information provided by Sadha PW1 had"
"decided to proceed to Mohaththuwaram in the car. Hence, the police party"
"under the command of PW2 was stationed near the bungalow of the Coast"
"Conservation  Department  Circuit.  After  a  successful  raid  all  of  them  had"
"met near the Coast Conservation Department Circuit Bungalow  again and"
"PW2 had assisted PW1 to conduct further investigations."
"After  the  conclusion  of  the  evidence  of  PW1,  the  prosecution  had  led  the"
"evidence of PW2."
