"entirely vests with the court."
"The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows."
"The  victim  was  07  years  old  and  was  in  grade  two  at  the  time  of  the"
"incident.  He  cannot  remember  the  exact  date  or  the  time  of  the  incident."
"The  Appellant  is  his  aunt’s  daughter  who  lived  in  close  proximity  to  his"
"house. It was usual for the victim to visit the Appellant’s house and on one"
"such  occasion,  only  the  Appellant  had  been  at  home.  Thereafter,  the"
"Appellant  had  called  the  victim  into  the  room,  removed  his  trouser,  laid"
"him  on  the  bed,  slept  over  his  body  having  placed  the  Appellant’s  female"
"organ on the victim’s male organ and hence committed the offence."
"According  to  the  victim,  the  act  had  continued  for  about  an  hour  and  the"
"Appellant had let the victim go home only after instructing him to keep the"
"incident in confidence."
"This incident had come to light when the victim was involved in an incident"
"with  a  female  student  studying  in  grade  three  of  his  school.  After  the"
"detection  of  this  incident,  the  school  authority  had  informed  this  to  the"
"victim’s parents and lodged a complaint with the police as well."
"The  Appellant  had  given  evidence  from  the  witness  box  and  denied  the"
"charge."
"Now  the  Appellant  seeks  the  courts  indulgence  only  to  reconsider  her  jail"
"sentence  on  the  application  of  the  Supreme  Court  determination  given  in"
"No. 03/2008 decided on 15/08/2008."
"In  the  aforementioned  SC  Reference,  the  High  Court  of  Anuradhapura  by"
"its  communication  dated  14/05/2008,  made  a  reference  to  the  Supreme"
"Court  in  terms  of  Article  125(1)  of  the  Constitution  of  Sri  Lanka.  In  that"
