"In the case of Regina Vs. Exall (176 English Reports, Nisi Prius at page 853)"
"Pollock, C.B., considering the aspect of circumstantial evidence remarked;"
"“It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to be considered as a chain,"
"and each piece of evidence as a link in a chain, but that is not so, for then,"
"if  any  one  link  brock,  the  chain  would  fall.  It  is  more  like  the  of  a  rope"
"composed of several cords. One strand of the rope might be insufficient to"
"sustain  the  weight,  but  three stranded  together may be quite of sufficient"
"strength.”"
