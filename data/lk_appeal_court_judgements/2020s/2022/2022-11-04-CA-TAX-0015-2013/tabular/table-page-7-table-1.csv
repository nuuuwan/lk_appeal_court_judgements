"[16] The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the term “hearing”"
"as used in section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No.  23 of 2011 (as"
"amended prior to 2013), does not refer to an oral hearing. His contention was"
"that the word “hearing” in that context has the same meaning as “to hear and"
"determine” referring to Stroud’s Dictionary (London, Sweet & Maxwell, 7thedn."
"Vol. 2). He submitted, therefore, that the “hearing” does not commence with"
"the  oral  hearing,  but  at  a  point  anterior  to  it,  when  a  party  submits  to  the"
"jurisdiction of a tribunal. The Appellant’s argument is that the hearing in the"
"case  commenced  prior  to  the  date  of  the  oral  hearing  on  12.06.2012  and"
"therefore, when the determination was made on 07.03.2013,  the Appellant’s"
"appeal before the TAC was time barred by operation of law."
"[17]  The  learned  Senior  Additional  Solicitor General  however,  countered  the"
"submission of the Appellant and submitted that the word “hearing” in section"
"10  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act,  No.  23  of  2011  is  clearly  an  ‘oral"
"hearing’ as determined by the Court of Appeal in Mohideen v. Commissioner"
"General of Inland Revenue (2015) XXI BASL Law Journal p. 171). She submitted"
"that the first oral hearing was on 12.06.2012 and the determination was made"
"on 07.03.2013 and accordingly, the determination of the TAC has been made"
"within a period of 270 days as required by the Tax Appeals Commission Act,"
"No. 23 of 2011 (as amended)."
"[18] The learned Senior Additional Solicitor General further submitted that the"
"time limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23"
"of 2011 is not mandatory, but rather directory, and the failure to adhere to the"
"time limit specified in the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 cannot"
"render the TAC functus officio to hear and determine the appeal. She relied on"
"the  decisions  of 
this  Court 
in  Stafford  Motor  Company  Limited  v.  The"
"Commissioner  General  of 
Inland  Revenue 
(CA  /Tax/17/2017,  decided  on"
"15.03.2019)."
"[19]  The  time  limit  for  the  determination  of  appeals  by  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission  was  originally  contained 
in  Section  10  of 
the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission  Act,  No.  23  of  2011,  which  stipulated  that  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission shall make the determination within a period of one hundred and"
"eighty days from the date of the commencement of the hearing of the appeal."
"It reads as follows:"
