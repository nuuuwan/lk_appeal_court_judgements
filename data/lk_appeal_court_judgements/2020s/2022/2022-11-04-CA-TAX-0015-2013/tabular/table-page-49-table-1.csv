"[150]  The  Appellant  contended  that  RMCC  and  PSL  invoiced  goods  to  the"
"Appellant on a VAT invoice that sets out sales made by RMCC and PSL to the"
"Appellant. The Appellant argued that the ownership passed at the  point of"
"sale when the invoices were issued by RMCC and PSL to the Appellant within"
