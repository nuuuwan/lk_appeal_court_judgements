"hundred  and  seventy  days  of  the  time  of  the  commencement  of  the"
"hearing  of  the  appeal  [(prior  to  the  Tax  Appeal  Commission  (Amendment)"
"Act, No. 20 of 2013)], the hearing commences from the date of oral hearing."
"The  oral  hearing  in  the  present  case  commenced  on  12.06.2012  and  the"
"determination  was  made  by 
the  TAC  on  07.03.2013  and 
therefore, 
the"
"determination of the appeal by the TAC is not time barred in terms of section"
"10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 as amended by the Tax"
"Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 04 of 2012."
"[25] I will now turn to the submission made by the learned Senior Additional"
"Solicitor  General  that  the  word  ""shall”  used  in  section  10  is  normally  to  be"
"interpreted  as  connoting  a  (directory)  and  not  mandatory  provision.  She"
"submitted  that  the  effect  of  any  breach  does  not  render  the  determination"
"invalid in the absence of any consequences being specified in the legislation."
"Her submission was that the Tax Appeals Commission Act does not spell out"
"any  sanction  for  the  failure  on  the  part  of  the  Tax  Appeals  commission  to"
"comply with the time limit set out in section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission"
"Act. She invited us to hold that the time limit set out in section 10 of the Tax"
"Appeals Commission Act is only directory, and not mandatory."
"Mandatory-directory classification"
"[26]  Section  10  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Act  stipulates  that  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission 
shall  make 
its 
determination  within 
270 
days 
of 
the"
"commencement of the hearing of the appeal. Superficially, the effects of non-"
"compliance of a provision are dealt with in terms of the mandatory-directory"
"classification.  Generally,  in  case  of  a  mandatory  provision,  the  act  done  in"
"breach thereof is void, whereas, in case of a directory provision, the act does"
"not become void, although some other consequences may follow (P.M. Bakshi,"
"Interpretation of Statutes, First Ed, 2008).  But, the use of the word “shall” does"
"not always mean that the provision is obligatory or mandatory, as it depends"
"upon the context in which the word “shall” occurs and the other circumstances"
"(Vide-Indian Supreme Court case of The Collector of Monghyr v. Keshan Prasad"
"Goenka, AIR 1962 SC 1694 at p. 1701)."
"[27]  Section  10  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  Act,  No.  23  of  2011  (as"
"amended)  does  not  say  what  will  happen 
if  the  TAC  fails  to  make  the"
"determination within the time limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals"
"Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as amended). It is true that the absence of"
