"[
72] Prof. C.G. Weeramantry in his Treatise “Law of Contracts, Vol. II, referring"
"to the local cases states at para 618:"
"“A court of justice in construing a document should have less regard to its letter"
"than  to  its  general  sense  and  intention.  This  rule  constitutes  an  important"
"modification of the rule discussed in the preceding section. Thus, the court will"
"not consider the mere name given to a transaction, but will rather see what the"
"transaction really is in truth and in fact upon a consideration of all the facts"
"relating to it. The rule that the real intention is to be preferred to the ordinary"
"meaning of words where such intention is clear is the first rule of interpretation"
"laid  down  by  Pothier.  Where  the  intention  is  clear  neither  grammar  nor"
"punctuation will prevail against it, for the language of Blackstone, neither false"
"English  nor  bad  Latin  will  destroy  a  deed.  Thus,  the  courts  will  not  attach"
"overmuch  importance  to  the  use  in  a  document  of  such  words  as  “agent’"
"‘mortgage’ or pledge’ ‘guarantee’,‘kaikili’ or ‘stridanum’ or ‘koratuwa’, but will"
"examine the transaction in order to determine its true nature. The real intention"
