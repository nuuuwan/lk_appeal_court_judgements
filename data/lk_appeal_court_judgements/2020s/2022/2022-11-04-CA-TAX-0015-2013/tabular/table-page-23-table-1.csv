"(iii) The extent to which each tool will assist the court in its task will vary"
"according to the circumstances of the particular agreement or agreements;"
"(iv) Some agreements may be successfully interpreted principally by textual"
"analysis,  for  example,  because  of  their  sophistication  and  complexity  and"
"because  they  have  been  negotiated  and  prepared  with  the  assistance  of"
"skilled professionals;"
"(v) The correct interpretation of other contracts may be achieved by a greater"
"emphasis on the factual matrix, for example, because of their informality,"
"brevity or the absence of skilled professional assistance. But negotiators of"
"complex formal contracts may often not achieve a logical and coherent text"
"because  of,  for  example,  the  conflicting  aims  of  the  parties,  failures  of"
"communication, differing drafting practices, or deadlines which require the"
"parties to compromise in order to reach agreement‚Äù."
