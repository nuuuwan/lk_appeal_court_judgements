"“I treat that judgment as indicating that in the view of Blackburn J. one has to"
"look to the substance of the contract. If you find, as they did in Lee v. Griffin, 1"
"B.  &  S.  272;  30  L.  J.  (Q.  B.)  252 that  the  substance  of  the  contract  was  the"
"production  of  something  to  be  sold  by  the  dentist  to  the  dentist's  customer,"
"then that is a sale of goods. But if the substance of the contract, on the other"
"hand,  is  that  skill  and  labour  have  to  be  exercised  for  the  production  of  the"
"article and that it is only ancillary to that that there will pass from the artist to"
"his client or customer some materials in addition to the skill involved in the"
"production  of  the  portrait,  that  does  not  make  any  difference  to  the  result,"
"because the substance of the contract is the skill and experience of the artist in"
"producing the picture”."
