"for the purpose of the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002. The TAC in its determination"
"dated 07.03.2013 stated:"
"“There are three conditions to be fulfilled to render a supply liable for VAT in"
"terms of section 2 of the VAT Act, namely, (a) the supply should be a taxable"
"supply of goods or services; (b) it is to be made by a VAT registered person,"
"and; (c) it (supply) is made in the course of the carrying on, or carrying out, of"
"a taxable activity."
"The contention of the Appellant is that the value of the supplies made by the"
"Appellant Company is not liable for VAT in terms of section 3 of the VAT Act,"
"since  the  aforementioned  first  condition  is  not  fulfilled  in  the  present  case."
"However,  in  view  of  the  material  referred  to  above,  it  is  clear  that  the  said"
"supplies are to be treated as “taxable supplies”, as the Appellant Company is"
"the manufacturer of both products and accordingly, all the three conditions"
"are not fulfilled in the present case."
"In  the  circumstances,  the  supply  of  VIM  Dish  Wash  Bars  and  Signal  Tooth"
"Brushes  made  during  the  twelve  taxable  periods  from  January,  2008  to"
"December, 2008 are to be determined as “taxable supplies” for the purpose of"
"the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002”. [p. 296 of the TAC brief]."
