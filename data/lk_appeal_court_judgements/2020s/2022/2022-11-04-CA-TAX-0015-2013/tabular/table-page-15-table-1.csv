"","sold these goods since it is only engaged in the activity of buying from the"
"","contract  manufacturers.  He  contended  that  the  Appellant  has  not  claimed"
"","input tax credit in respect of such purchases and thus, it has not charged VAT"
"","for persons to whom it has sold goods.  He further submitted that RMCC and"
"","PSL are registered with the Inland Revenue Department as manufacturers for"
"","VAT purposes, and issued VAT invoices in respect of the present transaction"
"","indicating that they have made supplies of goods. His third argument was that"
"","the Appellant is only engaged in buying and selling products manufactured by"
"","the  RMCC  and  PSL,  and  therefore,  the  Appellant  does  not  fall  within  the"
"statutory definition of a “manufacturer” for the purposes of the VAT Act.",""
"[43]  On  the  other  hand,  the","learned  Senior  Additional  Solicitor  General"
"","submitted  that  the  wholesale  and  retail  supply  of  goods  is  carried  out  by  a"
"","manufacturer or importer are subject to VAT. She submitted, however, that the"
"","different acts which are covered under the definition of “manufacture” do not"
"","necessarily coincide with the person who is deemed to be the manufacturer"
"for the purposes of the VAT Act.",""
"","[44] Her submission was that the Appellant is engaged in the exploitation of"
"","intangible property as a sole and only licensee of Unilever, in terms of Article"
"","3 of the Trade Mark Agreement in connection with the manufacture, packing,"
"","advertising  and  sale  of  Unilever  products.  She  further  submitted  that  the"
"","exploitation of intangible property is a taxable activity as defined in section 83"
"","of the VAT Act. Her contention was that in terms of section 3 of the Trade Mark"
"","Agreement,  the  Appellant  cannot  sub  license  the  trademarks,  but  can  only"
"","exploit intangible property, exclusively and therefore, the supplies made by the"
"","Appellant are taxable supplies within the meaning of section 83 of the VAT Act."
"","[45]  She  further  submitted  that  despite  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  was  not"
"","physically engaged in the manufacture of the products, and the manufacturing"
"","takes  place  in  the  premises  of  RMCC  and  PSL  using  their  raw  materials,  the"
"","degree  of  control  vested  in  the  Appellant  throughout  the  manufacturing"
"","process, unequivocally established that it is the manufacturer. Her contention"
"","was  that  the  RMCC  and  PSL  are  only  providing  contract  services  to  the"
"","Appellant and the manufacturing of goods had been done by RMCC and PSL"
"subject to full control and supervision of the Appellant.",""
"","[46] She specifically drew our attention to the articles of the agreements which"
"","deal  with  the  involvement  of  the  Appellant  in  connection  with  the  product"
