"of  the  Finance  Act,  No.  11  of  1963.  The  assessee  in  that  case  imported"
"Ultramarine Blue in packets of 58 pounds under the name “Seagull Blue”. This"
"was packeted by mechanical and manual process by the assessee into smaller"
"packets  under  the  name  “Robin  Blue”  and  sold  wholesale.  There  was  no"
"change in the process of packeting. The chemical composition and physical"
"properties were not altered in the process of repacking."
"[138]  Under  such  circumstances,  the  Court  held  that  the  assessee  is  not  a"
"manufacturer, nor is there an adaptation of the article as there is no treatment"
"which changes the quality of the product, or makes an unfinished product a"
"finished one. Mere change of name by itself does not amount to adaptation"
"for sale."
"[139]  It  is  clear  that  the  assessee  who  imported  finished  goods  under  one"
"name, packeted by mechanical and manual process into smaller packets and"
"sold  them  under  a  different  name  without  any  change  in  its  composition,"
"quality or character of the finished product. . There was no transformation of"
"the products imported into a different product having a character, quality or"
"composition, and therefore the Court was justified in holding that it was not"
"an  article  manufactured  by  the  assessee  within  the  meaning  of  the  term"
"“manufacture”  in  section  159(1)  of  the  Finance  Act,  No.  11  of  1963.  As"
"discussed, the facts of the present case are completely different and therefore,"
"the decision in Revenue v. Reckitt and Colman of Ceylon Limited  (supra), will"
"not help the Appellant."
"[140]  Although  the  plant  and  machinery  employed  and  raw  materials  were"
"provided  by  RMCC  and  PSL  and  services  of  certain  employees  were  also"
"utilized in the manufacturing process, the were manufactured by RMCC and"
"PSL strictly as per the quality, formulations, specifications, quantity prescribed"
"by  the  Appellant.  It  is  not  necessary  that  the  Appellant  himself  should  be"
"personally  engaged  in  the  manufacturing  of  goods  by  its  own  plant  and"
"machinery at its own factory or pay the wages of the workers, if it is deeply"
"involved  in  the  manufacturing  activities  defined  in  section  83  where  the"
"Appellant  engages  a  third  party  for  getting  the  goods  manufactured  by  it"
"under its own effective control and supervision."
"[141] In Griffon Laboratories (P) Ltd v. Commissioner of Income Tax (supra), the"
"Tribunal held that the assessee was not a manufacturer of goods as it did not"
"own  or  process  any  plant  or  machinery  and  caused  those  goods  to  be"
"manufactured by a third-party company. The High Court held (at paragraph"
