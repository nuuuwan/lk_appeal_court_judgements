"the Appellant or dispose of products after duly removing trade name, label,"
"design or copyright used by RMCC on such products (Article 10.8)."
"[145] In the present case, although the plant and machinery employed for the"
"purpose  of  manufacture  belonged 
to  RMCC  and  PSL  and  services  of"
"employees were also utilized in that process, all obligations of RMCC and PSL"
"under 
the  agreements  were  performed  under 
the  supervision,  control,"
"direction  and  effective  and  deep 
involvement  of 
the  Appellant.  The"
"manufacturing activity was really that of the Appellant and the Appellant as"
"the  licensee  to  manufacture  trademarked  goods  can  be  considered  as  a"
"company engaged in manufacturing of goods for exclusive sale in the local"
"and export market."
"[146]  The  products  manufactured  were  exclusively  for  the  Appellant,  and"
"RMCC and PSL were not left with discretion to sell them to any other person."
"The  manufacturing  activities  were  done  under 
the  direct  control  and"
"supervision  of 
the  Appellant,  which 
in  my  view, 
tantamounted 
to  a"
"manufacturing  activity  defined 
in 
section  83  under 
the  definition  of"
"“manufacture”."
"[147] There is nothing to indicate that the discretion was left with RMCC and"
"PSL to exercise their independent skill and judgment in the manufacturing of"
"products without direction, control and supervision and involvement of the"
"Appellant (see the criterion used by Wright J. in Cammell Laird & Co. Ltd v."
"The Manganese Bronze and Brass Co. Ltd, (1934) A.C. 402 at. 420-421). In my"
"view,  the  mere  making  of  products  by  assembling  raw  materials  and  using"
"machines, labour and facility by RMCC does not tantamount to manufacture"
"as defined in section 83 of the VAT Act."
"[148]  I  am  of  the  view  that  a  manufacturer  is  a  person  by  whom  or  under"
"whose direction or control or manage the goods are manufactured for sale,"
"either by himself or through a third party for its behalf by deeply involved in"
"a manufacturing activity or process defined in section 83 of the VAT Act."
"Concept of buying and selling"
"[149] Now, I will turn to the Appellant’s argument that it was only engaged in"
"the business of buying and selling to earn a profit and that the transaction"
"was purely a trading in nature. Buying and selling is an agreement between"
"the  buyer  and  the  seller,  whereby  the  seller  has  the  duty  to  transfer  the"
"ownership  of  property  to  the  buyer  and  the  buyer  pays  the  price  of  the"
