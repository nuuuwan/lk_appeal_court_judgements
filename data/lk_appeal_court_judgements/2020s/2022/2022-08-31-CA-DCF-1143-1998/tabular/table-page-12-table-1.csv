"In this respect, it is the considered view of this Court that the plan marked","",""
"as Z, relied upon by the contesting Defendants is bad in law and has no","",""
"evidential value attached to the same on the basis that the said plan was","",""
"not prepared by the Commissioner who made the preliminary plan and the","",""
"same was not superimposed on the preliminary plan. Moreover, plan Z has","",""
"not been made in accordance with any title plan, whereas it is transpired","",""
"from the evidence of Mr. T. Piyasena,  the Surveyor who prepared plan Z","",""
"that the same was made as pointed out by the contesting Defendants. As","",""
"such,  plan  Z  and","the  evidence  adduced  on","that  plan  should  be"
"disregarded. On the same footing, the plans marked as 3V1 and 3V2 are","",""
"also liable to be disregarded.","",""
"Besides, the learned District Judge has rightly drawn his attention to the","",""
"fact that all four boundaries of the land described in the schedules of the","",""
"title deeds produced by the contesting coDefendants do not tally with the","",""
"boundaries  of  lots  3  and  4  in  plan  X.  It  is  pertinent  to  be  noted  that","",""
"according  to  the  contesting  Defendants  the  Western  boundary  of  their","",""
"land, namely Manikrala Pandigewatta should be the corpus in this case,","",""
"namely Dunuke Angewatta. But, as  per the title deeds of the contesting","",""
"Defendants,  the  Western  boundary  is  shown  as  Kalogana.  Hence,  it  is","",""
"apparent  that  lots  3  and  4  in  plan  X  are  not  the  land  called  Manikrala","",""
"Pandigewatta.","",""
"Furthermore,  the  schedules  described  in  the  statements  of  claim  of  the","",""
"contesting  Defendants  indicate  the  Dunuke  Angewatta  (corpus),  not  the","",""
"purported  land  claimed  by  them8.  According  to  the  title  deeds  of  the","",""
"contesting Defendants (3V1, 3V2, 3V3 and 3V4) the original land is shown","",""
"as Dunuke Angewatta (corpus).","",""
"In  these  circumstances,  having  scrutinized  the  oral  and  documentary","",""
"evidence adduced, on the balance of probability, it is well established that","",""
"lots 3 and 4 in plan X are also part of the subject matter, namely Dunuke","",""
"Angewatta. There is no adequate evidence before the learned trial  Judge","",""
