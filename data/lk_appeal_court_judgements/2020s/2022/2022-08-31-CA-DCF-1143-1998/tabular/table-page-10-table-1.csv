"learned District Judge has failed to identify the corpus in reference to"
"a legally admissible preliminary plan."
"(5).  The  consent  of  the  parties  cannot  confer  power  or  authority  in"
"Court,  unless  such  a  power  has  not  been  conferred  by  the  Statute."
"Consent of the parties, however, can give no authority or jurisdiction"
"to  a  Court,  to  deviate  from  the  substantial  law  or  an  imperative"
"procedural  step.  It  is  a  fundamental  principle  that  no  consent  can"
"confer a Court the authority to exercise its power in a particular way"
"when  the  Law  expects  the  Court  to  do  it  in  a  different  manner."
"Therefore, the decision of the learned District Judge to treat Lot A and"
"C depicted in the second plan as the corpus lacks any legal bar."
"(6).  The  Court  has  a  duty  to  identify  the  corpus  without  causing"
"damages to third parties by dragging their lands into the corpus. One"
"of the ways in which it could be achieved is by having recourse to a"
"legally prepared preliminary plan and a report. In the absence of such"
"a plan and report Court may unconsciously extend a helping hand to"
"collusion  against  the  rest  of  the  world  which  can  take  away  the"
"sanctity attached to a final decree. Hence, it is totally unsafe to decide"
"on the corpus with the help of a plan and report prepared outside the"
"Legislative guidance shown under Sections 16 and 18.‚Äù"
