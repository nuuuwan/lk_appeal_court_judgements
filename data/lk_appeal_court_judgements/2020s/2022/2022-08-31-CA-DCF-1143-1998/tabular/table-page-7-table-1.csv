"therein. In this case, the Commissioner in his report  marked as X1 has"
"categorically stated that the land depicted in the Preliminary plan is the"
"land sought to be partitioned which is admissible evidence in terms of the"
"provisions of the Partition Law.  Besides, G.R.W.M. Weerakoon, Licensed"
"Surveyor  who  prepared  the  preliminary  plan,  while  giving  evidence  in"
"Court, without any ambiguity asserted that lots 1, 2, 3 and 4 in plan X are"
"the corpus sought to be partitioned."
"According to the Plaint, the extent of the subject matter is approximately"
"one  Amunam  which  is  equivalent  to  approximately  2  Acres.  The  land"
"depicted in plan X is A1-R1-P20.60 which is less than the actual extent,"
"and therefore,  it is understood that the disputed lots are too part of the"
"corpus. However, as enunciated by the Court of Appeal in Yapa’s case and"
"Welegedera Sekera’s case (Supra), inconsistency in extent will not affect"
"the question of the identity of lands."
"To establish the fact that the disputed lots are the land called Manikrala"
"Pandigewatta, the 1-6 Defendants have obtained a plan bearing No. 1000"
"dated 21-10-1993 made by T. Piyasena, Licensed Surveyor marked Z. It is"
"to be noted that the plan Z has not been superimposed on the preliminary"
"plan marked X."
"In partition actions, there will be one preliminary plan that is made by the"
"commissioner, and all the title plans relied upon by the parties are to be"
"superimposed on the said preliminary plan. The Court is entitled to issue"
"a  commission  to  the  Surveyor  General  to  prepare  a  plan  to  identify  the"
"corpus,  on  its  own  motion  or  upon  the  application  of  the  parties  to  the"
"action."
"If  the  necessity  arises  to  survey  any  larger  or  smaller  land  than  that"
"pointed  out  by  the  Plaintiff,  where  a  party  claims  that  such  survey  is"
"necessary for the adjudication of the action, the such commission should"
"be issued to the same commissioner who made the preliminary plan, and"
"not to another Surveyor, as stated in section 16 (2) of the Partition Law,"
"which reads thus;"
