"In this context, the question that arises for determination in this Appeal is",""
"whether  lots  No.  3  and  4  in  plan  X  are  part  of  the  land  sought  to  be",""
"partitioned,  namely  Dunuke  Angewatta  or  the","land  called  Manikrala"
"Pandigewatta, claimed by the 1-6 Defendants.",""
"It is settled law that, in partition suits, identification of the corpus is very",""
"important before considering the devolution of shares of the co-owners. In",""
"the event of failure to identify the corpus, the action should be dismissed",""
"without 
considering 
the  pedigree. 
In 
this","regard, 
I 
refer 
to 
the"
"determination  of 
the  Supreme  Court 
in","the  case  of  Sopinona  Vs."
"Pitapanaarachchi and others1, Saleem Marsoof, J. observed that “Clarity",""
"in regard to the identity of the corpus is fundamental to the investigation of",""
"the  title  in  a  partition  case.  Without  proper  identification  of  the  corpus,  it",""
"would be impossible to conduct a proper investigation of title.”",""
"The  Court  of  Appeal  in  case  No.  CA-504/84F-  CA-Minute  dated  9-10-",""
"19962,  held  that  “if  the  Plaintiff  cannot  identify  the  land  sought  to  be",""
"partitioned, (correctly) action must be dismissed. (The boundaries given in",""
"the  Plaint  and  the  boundaries  mentioned  by  the  Plaintiff  in  evidence  and",""
"deeds are different.).",""
"It  is  settled  law  that  the  land  sought  to  be  partitioned  can  properly  be",""
"identified with the boundaries. Even if there is any inconsistency in extent,",""
"it will not affect the identity of the subject matter when the boundaries are",""
"correct.",""
"In Yapa Vs. Dissanayake Sedara3, It was held that “inconsistency in extent",""
"will  not  affect  the  question  of  identity  if  the  portion  of  land  conveyed  is",""
"clearly described and can be precisely ascertained.”",""
"In the case of Welegedera Sekera Vs. Ratnapala,4 Chithrasiri J. observed",""
"that  “inconsistency  in  extent  will  not  affect  the  question  of  the  identity  of",""
"lands. The land can be  identified  as  having looked  at  its boundaries  and",""
"also by referring to the manner in which it was possessed.”",""
