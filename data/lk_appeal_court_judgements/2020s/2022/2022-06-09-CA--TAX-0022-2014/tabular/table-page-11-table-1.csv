"‘Expressio  unius  est  exclusio  alterius’:  expression  of  one  thing  is  the"
"exclusion of the other is a well-known maxim of interpretation."
"Bindra expressed the following view regarding the above maxim:25"
"E
xpressio unius est exclusio alterius. - ‘The express mention of one thing"
"implies  the  exclusion  of  another.  This  maxim  is  a  product  of  logic  and"
"common  sense.  No  doubt  this  rule  is  neither  conclusive  nor  of  general"
"application and is to be applied with great caution. It may be applied only"
"when  in  the  natural  association  of  ideas,  the  contract  between  what  is"
"provided  and  what  is  left  out  leads  to  an  inference  that  the  latter  was"
"intended to be excluded. Very often particular words are used by way of"
"abundant caution, and the application of the maxim becomes inadvisable.’"
"O
n the above analysis, it is my considered view that the words ‘relevant"
"turnover’ in Section 2 (1) of the ESC Act should mean the total amount"
"received by the Appellant, irrespective of the fact that a portion of it has to"
"be  paid  back  to  the  media  institution  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  ‘the"
"media’)."
