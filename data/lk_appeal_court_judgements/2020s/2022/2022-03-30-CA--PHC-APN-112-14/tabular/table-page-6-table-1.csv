"its  exercise  must  not  be  arbitrary  or  made  in  a  fanciful  manner.  It  should  be"
"sound and guided in law."
"When interpreted in its plain meaning, Section 15 of the Act does not give rise to"
"any harshness or inadequacy. It gives two options to the judge: either to impose"
"a  fine  or  a  term  of  imprisonment.  The  impugned  order  has  been  misguided  to"
"impose both a fine and a term of imprisonment when the legislature only intended"
"to impose one or the other. Such an interpretation of Section 15 of the Act is an"
"absurdity and contrary to common sense. Therefore, it is the considered view of"
"this  Court  that  the  imposition  of  both  a  fine  and  a  term  of  imprisonment  is  a"
"grave  misconstruction  of  the  plain  and  unambiguous  stipulations  of  law  as"
"contained in Section 15 (1) Tobacco Tax Act No 8 of 1999 (as amended)."
"This Court see no reason to interfere with the sentence of the learned Magistrate"
"dated 04.03.2010. The imposition of a fine of Rs. 25,000 is within the ambit of"
"the discretion of the Magistrate and a party cannot insist on the imposition of the"
"maximum penalty envisioned by a statutory provision unless compelling reasons"
"are provided. An aggrieved party is in no way entitled by way of a right to demand"
"the  maximum  punishment.  Such  party  can  only  make  a  request and  the  final"
"determination lies with the judge where he uses his discretion depending on the"
"facts of each case. The Law stipulates that upon conviction, an accused will be"
"liable  to  a  fine  not  exceeding  one  million  rupees  or  to  imprisonment  of  either"
"description  for  a  term  not  exceeding  five  years.  The  learned  Magistrate  in  the"
"instant matter, after accepting a plea of guilt by the petitioner at the first instant,"
"has opted to impose a fine and has set the quantum of such fine as Rs. 25,000/."
"There is no irregularity in this sentence. Nothing has been presented to this Court"
"to say that the petitioner was a repeat offender of similar offences or any other"
"offence."
"In  summation,  the  instant  application  deals  with  the  discretion  of  the  learned"
"Magistrate in imposing a fine upon conviction of an offence as per Section 15(1)"
"of  the  Tobacco  Tax  Act  No  8  of  1999  (as  amended),  based  on  the  facts  and"
"circumstances of the case. This Court see no reason to interfere with the use of"
"discretion by the learned Magistrate."
