"In the case of Ridge Vs. Baldwin 1964 AC 40 Lord Reed said, “The law regarding"
"master and servant is not in doubt. There cannot be specific performance of a"
"contract of service, and the master can terminate the contract with his servant"
"at any time and for any reason or for none. But if he does so in a manner not"
"warranted by the contract he must pay damages for breach of contract. So the"
"question in a pure case of master and servant does not at all depend on whether"
"the master has heard the servant in his own defence: it depends on whether the"
"facts emerging at the trial prove breach of contract. But this kind of case can"
"resemble dismissal from an office where the body employing the man is under"
"some statutory or other restriction as to the kind of contract which it can make"
"with its servants, or the grounds on which it can dismiss them. The present case"
"does not fall within this class because a chief constable is not the servant of the"
"watch committee or indeed of anyone else.”"
