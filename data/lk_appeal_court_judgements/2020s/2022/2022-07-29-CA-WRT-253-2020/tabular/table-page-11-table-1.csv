"As per Rule 4 of the SLAS Constitution, the Executive Council appears to have the"
"discretion  to  decide  whether  to  confer  voting  rights  on  a  new  Member  Club  that  has"
"completed one year’s probation."
"I
t  is  trite  that  there  is  neither  unfettered  nor  untrammeled  discretion.  That"
"discretion conferred must be exercised correctly and to suit the purposes for which it was"
"conferred.  This  Court  cannot  substitute  its  views  for  that  of  the  body  exercising  that"
"discretion merely because such body arrived at a conclusion different from that which this"
"Court prefers. Nevertheless, this Court can in the performance of its supervisory functions"
"inquire on what basis such discretion was exercised, that is to review the exercise of that"
"discretion on the ordinary principles of judicial review. To assess whether discretion has"
"been properly exercised the reasons for such a course of action must be evaluated. As was"
"suggested in the landmark judgment of Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and"
"Food  [1968]  A.C.  997,  if  a  prima  facie  case  of  unlawfulness  was  established  by  the"
"applicant,  then  in  the  absence  of  reasons  the  court  could  infer  that  the  power  was"
"exercised outside of the legislative purpose. A position echoed by his Lordship Fernando"
"J.  in  Wijepala  v.  Jayawardane  SC  89/95  SCM  30.06.95  (cited  in  Hapuarachichi  v."
"Commissioner of Elections [2009] 1 SLR 1):"
"“
However, when this Court is requested to review such a decision if the Petitioner"
"succeeds in making out a prima facie case, then the failure to give reasons becomes"
"crucial. If reasons are not disclosed, the inference may have to be drawn that this is"
"because in fact there were no reasons―and so also, if reasons are [now] suggested, they"
"were in fact not the reasons, which actually influenced the decision in the first place.”"

"T
he  Respondents  state  that  NEMRC  has  not  fulfilled  the  requisite  criteria,  in"
"terms of Rule 4 of the SLAS Constitution, to be registered as an affiliate Member Club"
"and  that  NEMRC  has  failed  to  pay  the  subscription  payable  by  an  applicant  seeking"
"affiliation and, on this basis, it was not made an affiliate Member Club."
"However,  there  does  not  appear  to  be  any  document  to  show  that  such  reasons"
"have been communicated to NEMRC. Although the Executive Council can refuse entry of"
"a Member Club that has completed probation, in the instant case, no documents dated on"
"or about the time that probationary period came to an end (that is in 2016) to show that"
"such has been informed to the Member Club or any Minutes of the Council Meetings in"
