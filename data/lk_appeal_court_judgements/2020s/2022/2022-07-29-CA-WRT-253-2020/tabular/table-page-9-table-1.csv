"Minister  to  resolve  grievances  and  disputes  pertaining  to  any  National  Association  of"
"Sports, by letter dated 10th November 2018 (marked “P17”) wrote to SLAS recommending"
"that NEMRC be registered as an affiliate Member Club of SLAS as NEMRC had fulfilled"
"the requirements stipulated in the Constitution of SLAS."
"N
evertheless, the Petitioners state that, despite subsequent requests of NEMRC"
"to register it, the final of such requests on 12th February 2019 (marked “P19”), it is yet to"
"be registered as an affiliate Member Club and is thus before this Court."
"T
he  7A  to  33A  Respondents  (the  caption  of  the  instant  application  has  been"
"amended to include the 7A to 33A Respondents to reflect the change in the membership"
"of the Executive Council following the Annual General Meeting held on 31st August 2020)"
"contend that the document marked “P8” relied on by the Petitioners was one signed by"
"the  Secretary  of  SLAS.  However,  because  of  the  judgment  of  this  Court  in  CA  WRT"
"Application No. 315/2014 delivered on 31.03.2016, the election of the office bearers to the"
"Executive  Council  of  SLAS  at  the  election  held  on 27th  August 2014  has  been  declared"
"ultra vires."
"I
t must be noted that the judgment of this Court was delivered on 31st March 2016."
"It declared the elections held on 27th August 2014 ultra vires on the basis that the decision"
"of the then Director General of Sports Development to hold an election for the Executive"
"Council of SLAS was ultra vires. It was found that the Director General had exceeded his"
"powers in terms of the Sports Law and its Regulations in doing so."
"W
e  do  not  think  that  it is  just and  fair  for  the  Respondents  to  resile  from  their"
"representation made to NEMRC on 09th March 2015 (“P8”). The communication, which is"
"admitted by the Respondents to be signed by the Secretary, states the fact of NEMRC’s"
"recognition  as  an  affiliate  Member  Club.  It  is  not  contended  that  the  signature  of  the"
"Secretary  is  forged  or  that  the  document is  fraudulent  or  any  other  contention  to that"
"effect. The fact that the decision evidenced therein had been made has not been denied."
"The Respondents did not contend that there was no such decision.  There is no material"
"submitted  to  this  Court  to  show  whether  this  decision  was  taken  by  the  previous"
"Executive  Committee  or  the  Executive  Committee  that  was  elected  after  the  unlawful"
"election. Nonetheless, the decision so made had been communicated."
