"In buttressing this observation, the learned High Court further refers to the State"
"Counsel who made submissions on behalf of the Attorney General in the course"
"of the appeal. As such, reference is made to the petition. The signature placed at"
"the end of the petition does not contain the words ‘Complainant-Appellant’ but"
"rather the name of the State Counsel appearing on behalf of the Attorney General."
"This  Court  agrees  with  the  analysis  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge.  The"
"discretion vested  on the Attorney General in  advising  or otherwise deciding on"
"the institution of criminal proceedings is clearly set out in the CPC. In this regard,"
"Sections 360, 393 (2), (4), 401, of the CPC and 114 (d) of Evidence Ordinance can"
"be  referred  to.  When  a  State  Counsel  appears 
in  their  official  capacity  as"
"representatives of the Attorney General, it is a presumption that such person is"
"acting under the direction of the Attorney General unless strong evidence to the"
"contrary is presented. No such evidence was presented. The President’s Counsel"
"merely relied on the caption of the appeal, which the record shows, was amended"
"subsequently  on  07.07.2016  to  include  the  Attorney  General  as  a  party.  This"
"amendment  was  done  in  open  courts  and  no  objections  were  raised  by  the"
"petitioner."
"The  contention  of  the  President’s  Counsel 
for  the  petitioner  was  that  the"
"respondents had filed a fresh appeal by such amendment, by which the action is"
"time-barred. On this point, the analysis of the learned High Court Judge can be"
"relied on. The learned High Court Judge examines whether the filing of an appeal"
"is prescribed as falling outside the time bar of 28 days from the delivery of the"
"Magistrate Court order dated 30.12.2015. Observing that the appeal petition was"
"filed on 01.02.2016, the impugned order holds the petition was filed within 27"
"days and is thus not prescribed. In the order, the learned High Court Judge deals"
"with the effect of the amended petition whereby the Attorney General was added"
"as a party. It refers to the contention of the petitioner that the calculation of the"
"prescription should begin at such date of amendment i.e., 07.07.2016 (6 months"
"since the delivery of the Magistrate Court order). The learned High Court Judge"
