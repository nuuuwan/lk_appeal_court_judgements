"Therefore, it is the considered view of this Court that the appeal filed against the"
"order of the Magistrate dated 30.12.2015 has been properly constituted. Hence,"
"we see no reason to interfere with the dismissal of the preliminary objection by"
"the High Court in its order dated 05.06.2018. Therefore, this Court directs the"
"expeditious conclusion of the inquiry pending before the High Court which has"
"been put on hold due to this revision application."
"Application dismissed."
