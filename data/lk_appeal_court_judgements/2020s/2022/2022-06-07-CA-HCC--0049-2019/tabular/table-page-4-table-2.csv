"Prosecution sought to establish the recovery of the vehicle according to the instructions and"
"guidance of the accused made."
"It is important to note that in the judgment of King vs Appuhamy 46 NLR 128, it was held that;"
"“... the fact that the deceased was last seen in the company of the accused loses a"
"considerable  part  of  its  significance  if  the  prosecution  fails  to  fix  the  exact  time  of"
"death of the deceased. Even if the prosecution has relied on the last seen theory, the"
"time of death could easily be inferred upon the clear evidence to the effect that the"
"accused-appellant told Karunadasa the deceased was dead. But he was with her, when"
"she was alive, a little over three hours ago. Therefore, the accused-appellant is not"
"entitled to succeed on this ground of appeal. The third ground of appeal also therefore"
"necessarily fails.”"
