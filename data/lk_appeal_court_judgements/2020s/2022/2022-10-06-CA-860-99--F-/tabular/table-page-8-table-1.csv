"Therefore, that witness had clearly stated no one else other than the 7th and 8th"
"Defendants possessed the corpus. In his examination in chief this witness had"
"never  stated  that  the  1st  Plaintiff  possessed  the  corpus.  But 
in  his  cross"
"examination this witness had stated that the 1st Plaintiff possessed the corpus"
"and he plucked coconuts in the five coconut trees situated in the land. This is a"
"material contradiction in the evidence of this witness and  the learned District"
"Judge could not have acted on that evidence in favour of the Plaintiffs."
"The learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs-Appellants in his written submissions had"
"drawn our attention to Section 18(2) of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977. Under"
"that provision, the preliminary survey plan and the report in a partition action"
"may, without further proof, be used as evidence of the facts stated or appearing"
"therein. Therefore, what the surveyor had reported in his report is admissible in"
"evidence without further proof. In the surveyor report marked X1, the surveyor"
"has reported that only the Plaintiffs and the Defendants other than the 7th and"
"8th Defendants claimed for the older plantation in lot 1. According to that report,"
"the 7th and 8th Defendants had not claimed for the older plantation. As against"
"that evidence, the 8th Defendant had stated in her evidence that the 7th and 8th"
"Defendants claimed for that plantation and the surveyor had not reported that"
"fact  to  court.  The  7th  and  8th  Defendants  had  mentioned  that  fact  in  their"
"Statement of Objections and therefore, that evidence can be believed."
"Therefore,  on  the  balance  of  probability  of  the  evidence  the  learned  District"
"Judge could have come to the conclusion that the 7th and 8th Defendants had"
"been in exclusive possession of the corpus and they had been in uninterrupted"
"and undisturbed possession of the corpus for more than 10 years prior to the"
"institution of this partition action."
"The 
learned  Counsel 
for 
the  Plaintiffs-Appellants  has  cited 
the  case  of"
"Sirajudeen and Two others v Abbas [1994] 2 SLR 365. The facts of that case can"
"be distinguished from the facts of this case. In Sirajudeen’s case there was no"
"clear proof of a starting point for the acquisition of the prescriptive right. In this"
"case  there 
is  a  clear  proof  of  the  starting  point  of  adverse  possession.  In"
"Sirajudeen’s case there was no consistency in the claim in regard to the period"
"of  occupation  of  the  premises  in  suit  and  the  period  of  possession  pleaded"
"varied  from  answer  to  answer  which  naturally  affected  the  credibility  of  the"
