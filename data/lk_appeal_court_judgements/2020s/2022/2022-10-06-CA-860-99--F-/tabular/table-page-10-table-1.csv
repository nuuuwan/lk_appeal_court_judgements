"The learned District Judge has come to the correct conclusion that the 7th and",""

"The Plaintiffs and the other co-owners had made no attempt to prevent those",""
"actions of the 7th and 8th Defendants and they had not complained to the Police",""

"and 8th Defendants had possessed the corpus with the intention of holding the",""
"land as owner (animus domini). They had been in possession for more than 10",""
"years  and  the  possession  was  uninterrupted  and  undisturbed  and","it  was"
"exclusive possession. The Plaintiffs and the other co-owners of the corpus had",""
"not been in possession. Therefore, on the balance of probability of evidence one",""

"prescriptive right to lot no. 1 of the corpus.",""
"For the aforementioned reasons, we see no merit in these two appeals. We are",""
"of  the  view  that  the  learned  District  Judge  has  come  to  a  correct  conclusion",""

"reason to interfere with those findings. Therefore, we affirm the judgement of",""
