"by any order passed under “The Waste Lands Ordinances, 1897 to 1903”, the Land"
"Settlement Ordinance, or to which the State is otherwise lawfully entitled;"
"Now the attention should be drawn to Section 20 of the said Ordinance. The Section 20(1)"
"stipulates the acts which are prohibited in any Forests other than a conservation forest,"
"reserved  forest  or  village  forest. Thus,  a  State Forest  other  than  a  Conservation  Forest,"
"Reserved  Forest  or  Village  Forest  can  be  recognized  as  ‘Other  State  Forests’  for  the"
"purpose of matters relating to this case, however subject to the 3 classifications discussed"
"above and also mentioned in the draft letter ‘X1’."
"In view of the above provisions of law, the Respondents argue that in terms of Section"
"64(2)(g), the relevant Minister is entitled to make regulations in respect of the matters set"
"out within any forest which is not a conservation forest, reserved forest or village forest."
"Anyhow, I am of the view that whatever the regulations made by the Minister should not"
"override the expressed provisions of the Forest Conservation Ordinance. The hallmark of"
"the  said  ordinance  is  the  conservation,  protection  and  sustainable  management  of  the"
"forest  resources  which  comes  under  whatever  heading  such  as  conservation  forest/"
"reserved forest/ village forest/ and other state forests."
"At this stage, I advert again to the aforesaid draft letter ‘X1’. The learned ASG indicated"
"to Court on the final date of the hearing of this application that the Commissioner General"
"of Land is willing to formally issue the said draft letter, marked ‘X1’, irrespective of the"
"fact that the Petitioners of this case would consent to it or not. When the learned ASG, on"
"behalf of the Respondents submits that the category of land “other State forests” will not"
"be  disturbed  as  narrated  above,  there  is  no  necessity,  in  my  view,  for  this  Court  to  go"
"through a tedious process in discovering and determining on the other  particulars, facts"
"and circumstances pleaded by the Petitioners based on the impugned Circulars."
"I am aware that this is an application for judicial review and rights of the parties should be"
"decided  as  at  the  date  of  the  institution  of  these  proceedings.  However,  reasonable"
"clarification  given  by  the  relevant  authorities  upon  an  impugned  decision  of  which  the"
"vires is being challenged should be essentially taken into consideration in view of resolving"
"the  questions  involved.  I  take  the  view  that  the  clarifications  given  by  the  relevant"
"authorities  in  the  said  document,  marked  ‘X1’,  clears  any  ambiguity  on  the  impugned"
"Circular  ‘P7’  and  the  related  Circulars  in  regard  to  the  operation  of  such  Circulars."
