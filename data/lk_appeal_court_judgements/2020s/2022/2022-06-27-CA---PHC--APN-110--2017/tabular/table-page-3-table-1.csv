"status.  Therefore,  both  accused  respondents  have  pleaded  guilty,  and  they"
"have  been 
convicted  with  a 
fine  of  Rs.  10,000  and 
two  years 
simple"
"imprisonment.  Thereafter, 
they  have  been  ordered 
to  pay  Rs.30,000  as"
"compensation to the victim, in default two years of imprisonment."
"The first accused respondent who has had a previous conviction has been fined"
"Rs.25,000 in default one year simple imprisonment for the case which had been"
"at Kesbeewa Magistrate’s Court."
"The  first  accused  respondent  has  had  a  another  previous  conviction  from  the"
"Magistrate’s  Court  of  Rathnapura  for  which  he  had  been  once  again  fined"
"Rs.25,000 and in default one year simple imprisonment."
"The second accused respondent also has had a previous conviction and he had"
"been also fined Rs.25,000 and in default one year simple imprisonment."
"The  main  grievance  of  the  counsel  appearing  for  the  petitioner  is  that  the"
"sentence 
imposed  on 
the 
second  accused 
respondent 
for 
the  previous"
"conviction 
is 
inadequate  because  at  the  time  of  sentencing,  he  had  been"
"convicted with a death sentence."
"There  was  no  appearance  for  the  first  accused  respondent.  But  the  counsel"
"appearing for the Attorney General did not seriously canvass a case against him."
"But  she  vehemently  objected 
to 
the  sentence 
imposed 
for 
the  previous"
"conviction  of  the  second  accused  respondent  because  according  to  her  it’s  a"
"death  sentence  and  the  High  Court  judge  should  have  been  more careful  and"
"stringent in imposing the sentence."
"The  counsel,  who  appeared  for  the  second  accused  respondent,  took  up  the"
"position  that  the  victim 
in  the 
instant  matter  had  not  been 
interested 
in"
