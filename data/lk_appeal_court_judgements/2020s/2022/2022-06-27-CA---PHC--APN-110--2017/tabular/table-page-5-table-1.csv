"Court  the  inadequacy  of  the  sentence  imposed  by  the  High  Court  judge  in"
"respect of the previous conviction of the second accused respondent."
"Therefore,  this  Court has  to  decide  whether  it  is  exceptional  enough  to  shock"
"the  conscious  of  this  Court.  According  to  the  submissions  of  both  parties,  the"
"second  accused  respondent  had  been  sentenced  to  death  but  on  appeal  and"
"had been indicted in the High Court of Avissawella for a charge of Section 315"
"of  the  Penal  Code  which  sets  out  a  sentence  of 
imprisonment  of  either"
"description  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  three  years  or  with  fine  or  with"
"both. In the instant matter, the High Court judge had imposed an imprisonment"
"and fine and it is a sentence which is entirely within the law.  Thereafter he had"
"proceeded to consider the previous convictions of the accused respondents and"
"have  acted  under  Section  303  (13)  (iv)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code  which"
"says  “  make  no  order  with  respect  to  the  suspended  sentence,  and  may  in"
"addition,  impose  a  fine  not  exceeding  twenty-five  thousand  rupees  on  such"

"But  the  sentence  and  the  fine  imposed  for  the  previous  conviction  of  the"
"second accused respondent is within the framework of Section 303(13) (iv) of"
"the  Criminal  Procedure  Code.  Therefore,  there 
is  no 
illegality 
in  the  said"
"sentence,  but  of  course  there  are  certain  guidelines  which  have  been  laid"
"down under Section 303(1) (a) to (l)  of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code"
"which are not imperative on the judge but is discretionary. Therefore, as there"
"is  no  illegality  but  only  exercising  the  discretion  laid  down  under  Section"
"303(1)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code,  this  Court  sees  no  exceptionality"
"which amounts to an illegality to exercise the powers of revision of this Court."
"This  Court  also  takes 
into  consideration  the  principles 
laid  down 
in  AG  v"
