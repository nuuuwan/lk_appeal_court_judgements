"In that case, Samarakoon C.J observed as follows,"
"“To say that the rules laid down by the Buddha for the discipline and personal"
"conduct  of  his  disciples 
is  enforceable  through  civil  courts  by 
laymen  as"
"customary law, is abhorrent and should not rightly be entertained in any court.”"
"In the case of Maha Nayaka Thero, Malwatte Vihare v Registrar-General 39 NLR"
"186, in taking into consideration of Section 41(5) of the Buddhist Temporalities"
"Ordinance, Soertsz J observed as follows:-"
"“All  the  Ordinance  does  is  to  invest  the  Maha  Nayaka  Thero  and  the  Nayaka"
"Thero of every Nikaya with the right and imposes upon them the duty to make"
"all such corrections, additions or alterations as may be necessary to keep up to"
"date their registers.”"
"With regard to the contention that this would amount to giving the two Theros"
"referred to, arbitrary powers Soertsz J observed as follows:-"
"“It  must  be  assumed  that  the  Legislature  was  satisfied  that  ecclesiastical"
"dignitaries of that eminence would act with a proper sense of responsibility. If,"
"however, the Legislature did not intend to give the Maha Nayaka Thero and the"
"Nayaka Thero such power, the remedy is surely in the hands of the Legislature.”"
"For the aforesaid reasons and the authorities cited above, it is abundantly clear"
"that  the  decisions  of  the  Mahanayaka  Thero  or  Nayaka  Thero  of  the  Nikaya"
"(Sect) acting under the provisions of Section 41(5) of the Buddhist Temporalities"
"Ordinance of 1931 are not amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this court and"
"this court cannot question the validity of those decisions."
"However, when the arguments commenced the learned President’s Counsel for"
"the  Petitioner 
informed  us  that  he 
is  not  seeking  any  relief  against  the"
"Mahanayaka Thero. The Counsel informed us that he is confining his reliefs to"
"the Paragraph (b) of the prayer to the Petition. The learned Additional Solicitor"
"General 
for 
the  1st 
to  9th  Respondents  submitted 
that 
the  Petitioner 
is"
"attempting  to  do  something  indirectly  which  he  cannot  do  directly.  Without"
"challenging the expulsion directly he is challenging with indirectly."
