"priesthood he must be found guilty of committing an act of  පාරාජිකා and the"

"In  the  case  of  Mahamadagalle  Upananda  Thero  v  Dunupothagama  Sobitha"
"Thero  65  NLR  459,  Sansoni  J  (as  he  then  was)  quoting  from  Mahavagga  (at"
"1.27.6) which deals with the qualities which a pupil should possess in relation to"
"his tutor states thus:-"
"“The Pupil possessed of the following five qualities should be dismissed: if he is"
"wanting in great affection towards his teacher, if he has not much faith in him,"
"if he does not display correct modesty towards him, if he lacks great respect for"
"him, if he does not have much good will towards him”."
"Quoting  the  view  expressed  by  Rev.  Sri  Dharmarama  Thero  who  gave  expert"
"evidence in the case of Dammaratna Unnanse v Sumangala Unnanase 14 NLR"
"400, Sansoni J observed that “a pupil must continue to be obedient to his tutor,"
"and if he is disobedient it is inconsistent with his being a pupil in the Buddhist"
"sense.”"
"The very word ‘anthevasika’ used in the Vinaya to denote a pupil indicates that"
"he is one who is near at hand. Therefore, the Petitioner cannot maintain the"
"position that the 4 specific instances mentioned in the Parajika Paliya in Vinaya"
"Pitakaya  (පාරාජිකා  පාලිෙ  in  විනෙ  පිටකෙ)  are  the  only  instances  in  which  a"
"Samanera  Bhikku  can  be  expelled  from  pupilship,  for  the  aforementioned"
"reasons."
"We  are  not  called  upon  to  answer  the  question  whether  the  Petitioner  was"
"lacking the aforementioned qualities and we must refrain from going into that"
"question. The question that arises here is whether a formal inquiry is an essential"
"pre-requisite to a Samanera Bhikku forfeiting his rights."
"In  the  case  of  Mahamadagalle  Upananda  Thero  v  Dunupotagama  Sobitha"
"Thero cited above the Plaintiff Priest had deserted his tutor and left the temple"
"where the tutor was residing and the tutor informed the Mahanayaka Thero of"
"the Chapter that he has discontinued the pupil and prayed that his registration"
"be cancelled. No formal inquiry was held and the Mahanayaka Thero informed"
"the Registrar-General who amended the declaration of the pupil by adding the"
"remark “cancelled the pupilship”."
