"Phipson,  in  his  book  titled  Phipson  on  Evidence","(Sweet  &  Maxwell"
"Thomson Reuters,17th Edn.2015) states that:",""
"","“it is often important to establish the identity of a person who a witness"
"","testifies that he saw on a relevant occasion. Sometimes, the witness will"
"","testify that he had seen the person before, or even know the person well,"
"and therefore recognised the person observed on the relevant occasion”.",""
"Like  in  this  case,  many  crimes  are  committed  under  poor  light  conditions",""
"when  none 
is  able 
to 
identify","the  accused  person  properly. 
In 
those"
"circumstances the case will entirely rest on the proper identification of the",""
"accused  person.  If  the  identification  is  compromised,  the  net  result  would",""
"be  the  acquittal  of  the  accused  person  from  the  case.  Hence  identification",""
"evidence  should  be  considered  very  seriously  owing","to 
its  persuasive"
"nature.",""
"In Alexander v. R (1981) 145 CLR 395 at 426, Mason,J stated that:",""
"“Identification 
is  notoriously  uncertain.","It  depends  upon 
so  many"
"variables.  They 
include 
the  difficulty  one  has 
in","recognising  on  a"
"","subsequent  occasion  a  person  observed,  perhaps  fleetingly,  on  a  former"
"","occasion;  the  extent  of  the  opportunity  for  observation  on  a  variety  of"
"","circumstances;  the  vagaries  of  human  perception  and  recollection;  and"
"","the tendency of the mind to respond to suggestions, notably the tendency"
"","to substitute a photographic image once seen for a hazy recollection of the"
"person initially observed”.",""
