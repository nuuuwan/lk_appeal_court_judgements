"of material facts. Especially in view of the Respondent’s contention that the entry in P5 was"
"made without authority, the Petitioner’s failure to disclose whether there was a decision by the"
"Commissioner-General  under  section   28 before  amending   the  agricultural  land  register   (P5),"
"amounts to suppression and misrepresentation of facts. This will be dealt with elsewhere in this"
"Judgement."
"The Petitioner raised objections to the Respondent’s challenge on the entries in the agricultural"
"land register and argued, that at this stage the Respondents cannot impeach the entries in the"
"agricultural register, especially in view of section 53 (6) of the Act."
"Section 53 (6) states as follows;  “An entry in a register prepared or amended under the"
"provisions of this section and which is for the time being in force shall be admissible in"
"evidence and, shall be prima facie proof of the facts stated therein”.  Accordingly, entries in"
"the paddy land register are prima facie proof of the facts stated therein. Therefore, the Petitioner"
"contended that the Respondents cannot now challenge the validity of the entry in the paddy land"
"registry nor can the Respondents contend the land in question is paddy land. Answering this, the"
"Respondent’s contention was that the said presumption will not apply, as the said entry in the"
"register is a nullity and also the document P5 is not a certified copy of the Agricultural Land"
"Registry issued by the agrarian services committee. This Court observes that P5 is a photocopy"
"and there is no seal to say it is a certified copy by the issuing authority which is the agrarian"
"services committee."
"In the absence of a certified copy of P5 being tendered to this Court, we find the necessary"
"requirements for the presumption to apply, have not been complied with. In the objections filed"
"by the 3rd Respondent, he has submitted that there are no documents in the file pertaining to the"
"purported   inquiry   or   the   decision   and   has   put   the   Petitioner   in   strict   proof.   However,   the"
"Petitioner has failed to produce the proceedings or the purported decision that gave rise to the"
"entry in P5 but has only sought to take the cover under section 53 (6)."
"The Court will now consider submissions of the Respondents on the validity of the entry in P5."
"Is the entry in the Register a nullity?"
"It is common ground that there exists an entry in the agricultural land registry which depicts the"
"land described therein the extent of 7 acres as highland, and that the applicable law pertaining to"
"P5 is Act No 46 of 2000. Section 28 of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 empowers"
"the Commissioner-General to decide whether the land is paddy land or not.  Section 28 of the"
"Agrarian Development Act states as follows;"
"28(1) “The Commissioner-General may decide whether an extent of land is a paddy land”"
"28(2)   “The   Commissioner-General   may,   for   the   purpose   of   making   a   decision   under"
"subsection   (1),   call   for   an   obtain   the   observations   and   information   from   the   Agrarian"
"Development Council within whose area of authority the extent of land is situated, and"
"from the relevant government departments statutory boards and institutions, it shall be the"
"duty of every such  government department, statutory board, and  institution  to furnish"
"such observations and information as soon as practicable. “"
