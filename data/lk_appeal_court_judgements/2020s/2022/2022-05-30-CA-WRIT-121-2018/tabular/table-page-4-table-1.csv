"","the land converted to High Land is that, as per the situation of the land, it is not possible to make"
"","a proper irrigation system to cultivate paddy in the entire land.   However, Petitioner concedes"

"","Denying this position, the Respondents contended that the land was always a paddy field and the"

"","the entry in P5 converting the said land into high land did not have any authority to do so. Thus,"
"their contention is that P5 is void ab initio and has no legal validity.",""
"","Subsequent to the change of the nature of the land in P5, 7 acres of the land had been cultivated"
"","with High Land crops and not with paddy. In these circumstances, there had been complaints to"

"","In 2009 September, the Commissioner-General issued a notice on the Petitioner under sections"
"","22 and 23 of Act No 46 of 2000 for non- cultivation of the land (P12). This has been followed by"
"","a supervision order dated 11.11.2009 (P13). It is pertinent to note that both P12 and P13 names"
"","the land as a paddy field namely “maha kumbura”. The Petitioner has failed to submit to this"
"","Court, whether the said P12 and P13 had been replied to or not, or whether it had been brought to"
"","the attention of the author of the said letters that the land had now been registered as a high land."
"","After receiving the said documents, in 2012 the Petitioner had leased out the land for cultivation"
"","for a period of 5 years. The Petitioner was silent as to whether the land had been cultivated"
