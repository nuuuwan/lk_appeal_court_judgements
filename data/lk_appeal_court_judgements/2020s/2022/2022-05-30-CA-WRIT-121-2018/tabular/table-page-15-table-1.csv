"376 it was interalia held that “It is settled law that a person approaches the Court for grant of"
"discretionary relief, to which category and application for a writ of certiorari would undoubtedly"
"belong, has to come with clean hands, and should candidly disclose all the material facts which"
"have any bearing on the adjudication of the issues raised in the case. In other words, he owes a"
"duty of utmost good faith (uberimafides) to the court to make a full and complete disclosure of"
"all   material   facts   and   refrain   from   concealing   or   suppressing   any   material   facts   within   his"

"In Collettes Ltd Vs. Commissioner of Labour and others (1989) 2 SLR it was held “that it is"
"essential, that when a party invokes the writ jurisdiction or applies for an injunction, all facts"
"must be clearly, fairly and fully pleaded before the court so that the court would be made aware"
"of all the relevant matters.”"
"Therefore, we find that the contention of the Respondents, that the Petitioner has breached the"
"concept of uberima fides, succeeds."
"Considering the above-stated facts, and the decisions of the above-mentioned decided cases, this"
"Court agrees with the Respondent’s contention, that the Petitioner has not come to this Court"
"with clean hands, thus, by conduct, the Petitioner has disqualified himself to obtain the relief he"
"has prayed for."
"Accordingly, for all the reasons stated above, in this judgment, this Court is not inclined to grant"
"the relief prayed by the Petitioner and we dismiss this application without cost."
