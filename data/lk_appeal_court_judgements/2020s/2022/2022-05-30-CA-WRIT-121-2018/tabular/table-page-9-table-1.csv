"The plain reading of the section clearly demonstrates that the power to decide whether the land is"
"paddy   land   or   not   is   vested   with   the   Commissioner-General.     However,   for   this   particular"
"purpose,   he   may   call   for   the   observations   and   information   from   the   Agrarian   Development"
"Council"
"As per section 28(1) and as discussed above, the Commissioner-General has the discretion to call"
"for   the   observations   and   information   from   the   respective   Agrarian   Development   Council."
"However, the Agrarian Development Council has no power to change the nature of the land from"
"paddy land to high land on its  own. In the absence of any material to demonstrate that the"
"Commissioner-General had taken a decision to amend a paddy land into High Land and, with the"
"failure of the Petitioner to submit the inquiry proceedings in this regard and considering the"
"Respondent’s submission, denying, that the Petitioner had made an application to change the"
"nature of the land, and also denying that the Commissioner-General decided to change the nature"
"of the same, this would be an appropriate time to consider if the entry in the register is a nullity"
"and whether it would attract the presumption in section 53 (6) of the Agrarian Development Act."
"The Respondents strongly contended that the presumption will not be attracted as the entry in the"
"registry is a nullity. Therefore, it was their contention that the said entry is devoid of any validity."
"In Hewitson and Milner v. Fabre (1988) 21 QBD 6 at 9, it was held that, “the service of the"
"writ instead of a notice was a nullity, and not a mere irregularity, and that the order for service"
"of the writ and all subsequent proceedings must be set aside…”"
"In  CA   Application   No.   347/88,  SC   (Spl)   LA   Application   No.   23/2012,
 SC   Appeal   No."
"40/2013  Priyantha   Jayawardena,   PC.   J   cited   the   case   of  Desmond   Perera   and   others   Vs."
"Karunaratne Commissioner for National Housing (1997) 1 SLR 148  stated as follows, “…"
"Therefore,   the   decision   made   by   the   Commissioner   to   vest   the   house   based   on   a   belated"
"application is ab initio void and a nullity as the Commissioner acted without power. Thus, the"
"said decision of the Commissioner dated 16.09.1982 which is under reference is ab initio void"
"and a nullity. Hence, there was no valid order made by the Commissioner to be considered by"
"the Board of Review under section 39 of the said Law and, thus, the matter should have ended"
"there.”"
"In our view, the Petitioner has failed to address to the satisfaction of the Court, the issue of"
"nullity.
 The   Petitioner   has   failed   to   explain   his   inability   to   submit   the   decision   of   the"
"Commissioner-General. Therefore, in view of the principle laid down in the above cases, and in"
"the absence of a decision from the Commissioner-General under section 28 of the Act, prior to"
"the amendment reflected in P5 being made, the Respondent’s objection that the entry in P5 is a"
"nullity succeeds."
"We have come to this conclusion after also considering section 52 of the Agrarian Development"
"Act, which depicts the functions of the Agrarian Development Council. The said section 52 does"
"not empower the Agrarian Development Council to make a decision pertaining to the nature of"
"the land.   This Court has also considered section 53 of the Act No. 46 of 2000.   As per the"
"submissions made, we are satisfied that the amendment contemplated under section 53 (1) does"
