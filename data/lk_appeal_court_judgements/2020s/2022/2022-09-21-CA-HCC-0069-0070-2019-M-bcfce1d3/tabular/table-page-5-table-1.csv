"","by  the  2nd  appellant  as  to  the  manner  in  which  he"
"","was arrested by the police. It was the submission of"
"","the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General,  that  both  the"
"","appellants  were  arrested  together  when  they  were"
"","fleeing from the crime scene."
"7.","Both  the  accused  appellants  were  indicted  on  the"
"","basis  that  they  committed  the  alleged  offences  of"
"","robbery  in  furtherance  of  their  common  intention."
"","However,  none  of  the  eye  witnesses  PW1,  PW2  or"
"","PW3 has  identified the 2nd appellant to be a person"
"","who was involved in the robbery. The only evidence"
"","against  the  2nd  appellant  was  that  he  was  arrested"
"","and brought by the crowd in the neighborhood soon"
"","after  the  robbery.  There  was  evidence  to  the  effect"
"","that 
the  PW1’s  son  has  played  a  major  role 
in"
"","catching the robbers. However, he was not called to"
"","give 
evidence  by 
the  prosecution.  None  of 
the"
"","persons  who  were 
involved 
in  apprehending 
the"
"","robbers were called to give evidence. The evidence of"
"","the police officer PW7 was that, he went to the crime"
"","scene  upon  information  by  the  Officer  in  Charge"
"","that 
two 
robbers 
had 
been 
apprehended 
by"
"","civilians.  Therefore,  the  PW7  was  not  in  a  position"
"","to  testify  as  to  how  and  where  the  appellants  were"
"","arrested.  Hence,  the  prosecution  has  clearly  failed"
"","to  prove  beyond  reasonable  doubt  the  fact  that  the"
"","2nd appellant was involved in the robbery."
