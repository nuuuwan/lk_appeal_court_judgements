"the original or a certified copy of that deed to the District Court and ask for that"
"unallotted share."
"According to the pedigree disclosed by the 3A Defendant, one Wijehamy had"
"owned a 1/20th share. Wijehamy had died leaving his daughter Ran Ethana as his"
"sole  heir  and  those  rights  had  devolved  on  Ran  Ethana.  Ran  Ethana  had"
"transferred those rights to Charles Dissanayake and Charles Dissanayake in turn"
"had  transferred  those  rights  to  the  3rd  Defendant,  William  Dissanayake."
"According  to  the  3A  Defendant  that  1/20th  share  had  devolved  on  the  3rd"
"Defendant on the deeds marked 3වි5 and 3වි6. When one examines the contents"
"of 3වි5 it appears that Ran Ethana had transferred a 1/20th share which she has"
"inherited  by  paternal 
inheritance 
to  Charles  Dissanayake.  But  Charles"
"Dissanayake  had  not  conveyed 
those 
rights 
to 
the  3rd  Defendant,  Willy"
"Dissanayake on 3වි6 as disclosed by the 3A Defendant in his pedigree.  On 3වි6,"
"Charles Dissanayake had gifted those rights to one Maggie Dissanayake who is"
"not shown in the 3A Defendant’s pedigree. There is no evidence to show that"
"Maggie Dissanayake’s rights devolved on the 3rd Defendant. Therefore, the 3rd"
"Defendant will not get a 1/20th share on that chain of devolution and the learned"
"District Judge has come to a correct finding on the same."
"For  the  aforementioned  reasons, 
I  see  no  merit 
in  the  appeal  of  the  3A"
"Defendant-Appellant which should stand dismissed."
"I  will  now  consider 
the  appeal  of 
the  2A  Defendant-Appellant.  The  2A"
"Defendant-Appellant  had  shown  two  original  owners  namely  Pinhamy  and"
"Arachchi Appu in his original pedigree and the amended pedigree. According to"
"both pedigrees, Pinhamy and Arachchi Appu had owned a 1/4th share each. The"
"learned District Judge has given the 2A Defendant a share which is less than what"
"he had claimed. The 2A Defendant-Appellant in his appeal had stated that the"
"learned District Judge has failed to take into consideration the contents of the"
"deeds marked on behalf of the 2A Defendant."
"According  to  the  original  pedigree  and  the  amended  pedigree  of  the  2A"
"Defendant,  Pinhamy who  was  one  of  the original owners  who  owned  a  1/4th"
"share  had  died 
leaving 
five  children  Dingirihamy,  Nilhamy,  Anadahamy,"
"Ukkuhamy and Mudalihamy. Mudalihamy’s four brothers and sisters had died"
"issueless  and 
intestate  and 
therefore, 
their  rights  also  had  devolved  on"
"Mudalihamy who became entitled to a 1/4th share. Mudalihamy had transferred"
"a  1/20th  share  on  deed  no.  1411  to  his  son  Siriwardhenahamy  and  after  the"
"death of Mudalihamy his balance rights also had devolved on Siriwardhenahamy"
