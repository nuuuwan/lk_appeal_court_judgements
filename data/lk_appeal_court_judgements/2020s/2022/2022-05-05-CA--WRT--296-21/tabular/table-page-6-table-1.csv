"The 1st to 4th, 13th and 14th Respondents in their Statement of Objections state that"
"generally  the  applications  for  annual  transfers  are  called  for  and  finalized  by  the"
"month of December each year so that all the transfers shall be effective from the 1st"
"of January each year. Even for the year 2021, though the applications were called in"
"the month of April the transfer list was to be effective from the 1st of January. Since"
"the  transfers  got  delayed  in  2021  maximum  benefit  has  been  afforded  to  the"
"Applicants by extending the date of Board of Certification until 31 of December. The"

"amendment due to a mistake and therefore said Notification P4 had been amended"
"by the subsequent Notification P7 issued on 05.04.2021, 10 days before the closing"
"date  of  the  applications  for  transfers.  The  only  amendment  that  appears  in  the"

"the lists P9, P10 and P11 and that she will not be eligible for a transfer with effect"
"from 1st of January 2021. The 9th to 12th Respondents also state that the due process"
"has been followed in giving effect to the annual transfer of the Specialist Medical"
"Officers for the year 2021."
"When  this  matter  was  taken  up  for  argument  all  parties  made  submissions  and"

"Notification P4 has been amended by the Notification dated 05.04.2021 (P7) is not"
"in dispute. The Clause 5E of the said notification P4 disclosed the eligibility criteria"
"for the Specialist Medical Officers for annual transfers for the year 2021."
"Said Clause 5E is as follows;"
