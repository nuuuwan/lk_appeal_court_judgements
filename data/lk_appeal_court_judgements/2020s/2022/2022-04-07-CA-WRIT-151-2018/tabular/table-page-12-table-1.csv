"In our view the Petitioner’s contention is well-founded and this objection of the Respondents has"
"no merit and has to fail. We also find that the Respondents at no stage had submitted that the"
"Petitioner’s paddy field had not been cultivated or abandoned. However, consequently, they had"
"taken up the position that the filling of the roadway and the construction of the house was illegal."
"If so, what prevented them from taking action under the powers vested in them pursuant to the"
"provisions of the Agrarian Development Act No.46 of 2000. Especially under section 90(1). The"
"Respondents have failed to answer this question and have failed to act under the said section. the"
"Respondents have failed to give any reason as to why they failed to act under the said section"
"other than to state that there was no complaint, which this Court is not inclined to accept on the"
"grounds specified above."
"Accordingly for the reasons set out in this Judgement, the application of the Petitioner is partly"
"allowed, this Court grants a Writ of mandamus as prayed for in Prayer (b) alternative relief, to"
"act under section 90(1) of Act No. 46 of 2000 and according to law. As the Petitioner has been"
"partially successful in this application, we do not intend to award a cost. Thus, the parties will"
"bear their own cost."
