"Petitioner’s cultivating rights have been affected."
"However, this letter further alleges that the Petitioner has not been present for an inquiry, and as"
"a result, the author of the letter is unable to give the advice sought by the Petitioner pertaining to"

"of the Commissioner-General of Agrarian Development. The construction is on a paddy field and"
"the said land and the house had been transferred to the 5th Respondent in 2015. This has been"
"communicated by letter dated 30.06.2015 (PX13). The inspection had further revealed that the"
"footpath that had been used, had been filled and converted to a roadway to be used to access the"
"illegally constructed house. The letter goes on to state that there had been no legal action taken"
"pertaining to these illegal acts of construction and the Divisional Officer has observed that the"
"filled roadway had been used, to have access to the threshing floor and the pillewa. This report"
"further establishes the parties involved in the illegal act. Thereafter several correspondences have"
"been exchanged between the Petitioner  and the Commissioner-General of the Department of"
"Agrarian Development and several further inquiries have been held."
"It is evident by the document marked PX23B that the Assistant Commissioner of the Agrarian"
"Development had held another inquiry dated 10.08.2015 at the Kurunegala district office. The"
"said inquiry had been attended by the Petitioner, the 5th Respondent, and a witness on behalf of"
