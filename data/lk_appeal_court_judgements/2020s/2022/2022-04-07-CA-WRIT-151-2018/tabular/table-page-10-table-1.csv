"be used by the cultivator for a threshing floor or for constructing his dwelling house, as stated in"
"the section. It appears that the Petitioner too had her doubts on this issue as in her letter dated"
"06.04.2015 she had requested the Commissioner-General to clarify the legal position regarding"
"the pillewa. As correctly submitted by the Respondents, the Petitioner has failed to answer this"
"objection to the satisfaction of the Court and has failed to demonstrate that the pillewa falls"
"within the definition."
"The Petitioner has failed to demonstrate whether presently the pillewa is used or whether it is"
"used for the purposes defined in the Act. In the absence of such material before the Court, the"
"first part of the relief prayed by the Petitioner has to fail."
"The Respondents objecting to the relief prayed argue that, for them to act under section 32(1)(5)"
"the offence contemplate has to be an offence that is being committed. The learned Counsel drew"
"the attention of this Court to sec 32(1) the offences and the way it is described and submits what"
"the legislator has contemplated is for section 32(1) to be operative it has to be an offence that is"
"being   committed   in   the   present   but   the   illegal   filling   and   the   construction   had   taken   place"
"somewhere around 2006. Therefore, the contention of the Respondent is, for them to act under"
"section 32(5) the contemplated act should be a continuing offence. In view of this, the Court"
"finds that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the pillewa falls under the definition of"
"paddy land thus the necessity to answer this objection would not arise."
"The next objection Respondents raised was that for the Petitioner to complain, the Petitioner has"
"not established title to the pillewa. Thus, the Petitioner has no legal right to seek a writ. To"
"substantiate this objection, the Respondents submitted that there is pending litigation pertaining"
"to the ownership of the pillewa.  Both parties are not at variance with the existence of the case"
"that the 5th Respondent has instituted against the Petitioner of this application. It was common"
"ground that the said case is still pending. The Petitioner’s grouse is filling of the said pillewa and"
"construction of the road on it. However, we have perused the plaint in the District Court case"
"(P36) in the said case the title to pillewa is not contested. Hence the Respondent’s objection on"
"the Petitioner’s right to file this case based on title fails. This brings us to the next objection"
"raised by the Respondents on lashes and undue delay."
"As per the inquiry reports that have been submitted to the Court and of the Petitioner’s own"
"pleadings and submissions, it is evident that the paddy field had been filled and a house had been"
"constructed in the year 2006. However, there is no evidence or material submitted to this Court"
"to establish when the illegal filling of the pillewa had taken place or when the alleged road had"
"been constructed on the disputed pillewa. Therefore, this Court is not in a position to come to the"
"conclusion as to when the alleged filling of the pillewa has taken place, as no material evidence"
"has   been   submitted   to   this   Court   to   demonstrate   the   same.   It   is   also   pertinent   to   note   that"
"irrespective of when the construction had taken place, the Respondents has commenced their"
"inquiries on the complaint received in the year 2015 and the relevant officers had recommended"
"action to be taken. If there was an undue delay, the Respondents should have communicated it to"
