"killed the deceased. As he did not believe him and when he questioned him"
"further, the Appellant had confirmed that he had killed the deceased. At that"
"time the Appellant had possessed a long knife which was blood-stained and"
"warned the witness to not to follow him. The witness had observed that the"
"Appellant was quite agitated. He had been made aware of the death of the"
"deceased only the following morning."

"Appellant had set off with the deceased to Urumadiththa on the date of the"
"incident. They have left her house around 7.30 p.m. Around 9.00 p.m., the"
"Appellant had returned and told her that the deceased was drunk and had"
"asked her to take him home. Thereafter, she had gone to the fence and the"
"Appellant had then told her to switch off the lights but she had not complied."
"She had proceeded to call out her husband’s name but there had not been a"
"response.  Then  the  Appellant  had  left  in  the  direction  of  where  he  had"
"claimed the deceased to be. Thereafter she had gone up to the fence again,"
"this  time  accompanied  by  PW3  and  continued  looking  for  her  husband."
"However, neither the deceased nor the Appellant were to be found there at"
"that time. The following morning the body of the deceased had been found"
"about 200 meters away from the deceased’s house in a forest area."
