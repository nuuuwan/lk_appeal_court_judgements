"According  to  PW2,  the  Appellant  had  threatened  both  the  deceased  and"
"herself with death as the deceased had bullied him regarding a rumour that"
"the  Appellantâ€™s  wife  was  having  a  clandestine  affair  with  somebody  else."
"Neither the deceased nor this witness had taken the threat seriously. During"
"cross examination this witness had admitted that she did not tell this to the"
"police as the deceased had told her to disregard it as the Appellant was drunk"
"when  he  made  the  threat.  Therefore,  the  two  omissions  which  had  been"
"highlighted by the defence fail to create an impact on the evidence of PW2."
