"same time she was bitten by a serpent upon which she had undergone ayurvedic treatment"
"until December 2006. The Petitioner submits that she had even undergone a depression"
"condition which needed treatment for a long period. During the period of her absence in"
"service, the Petitioner has been served with a letter of vacation of post. As a consequence"
"to an appeal made by the Petitioner, the Public Service Commission (‘PSC’) by its letter"
"dated 30.10.2012 (‘X11’) has vacated the said order on vacation of post and she has been"
"reinstated subject to certain conditions."
"The  PSC,  by  virtue  of  the  said  order  marked  ‘X11’,  has  decided  to  defer  two  salary"
"increments of the Petitioner and also to consider the period that she was not in service as"
"a period of no-pay leave. After such reinstatement in service, the Petitioner has complained"
"that she was not receiving due salary increments. The Petitioner alleges that her period of"
"absence from work (27.09.2005 to 29.11.2012) has been considered as a period of no-pay"
"leave by the 4th Respondent. The Petitioner has submitted another appeal to the PSC based"
