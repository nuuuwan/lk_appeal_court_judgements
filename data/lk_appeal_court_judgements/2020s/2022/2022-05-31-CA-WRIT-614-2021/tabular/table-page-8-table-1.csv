"In  light  of  the  foregoing,  I  take  the  view  that  the  order  of  the  AAT  is  not  eminently"
"irrational or unreasonable or guilty of illegality. Hence, I arrive at the conclusion, based"
"on  the  arguability  principles  that  should  be  adopted  in  respect  of  matters  relating  to"
"issuance of notice in a judicial review application, that there is no arguable case or a prima"
"facie  case  for  this  Court  to  issue  formal  notice  on  the  Respondents  in  this  application."
"Therefore, I proceed to refuse this application."
