"to  the  Magistrate  since  the  person  from  whose  possession  property"
"was seized may have obtained possession of the property dishonestly,"
"fraudulently  or  criminally.  But 
it 
further  says 
that  “a  bona 
fide"
"purchaser  in  possession  of  property  that  had  previously  been  dealt"
"with  dishonestly/fraudulently  has  been  held 
to  be 
entitled 
to"
"possession of the property.”"
"In the case of Hasvi v Jayathissa and two others 2011 1 SLR 94 it has"
"been  held 
that,  “Magistrate  was  under  a  duty 
to  handover 
the"
"property  to  the  true  owner  and  not  the  person 
from  whom  the"
"property  was  seized  by  the  police  unless  the 
latter  was  the  true"
"owner”. But a contrary view had been held in the case of De Alwis v De"
"Alwis 1979 1 SLR 17 where it has been held that, “the property seized"
"by  the  police  should  be  returned  to  the  person 
from  whom  the"
"property has been seized.”"
"In 
the 
instant  matter,  at 
the 
inquiry 
the  appellant  has  not  cross"
"examined the witnesses put forward by the prosecution and neither has"
"he  given  evidence.  But  the  fact  that  the  chassis  and  engine  numbers"
"have  been  altered  is  common  ground  to  both  parties.  The  Magistrate"
"had confiscated the vehicle on the basis that although the accused that"
"were  charged  for  the  alternation  were  acquitted  because  the  date  of"
"alternation is not proven by the prosecution, the subject matter of the"
"instant  case  has  been  subject  to  an  illegal  activity.  But  as  the  date  of"
"alternation is not known and as the prosecution has failed to establish"
"the  same,  the  substantive  case  has  failed.  The  appellant  had  claimed"
"the  vehicle  because  as  per  the  documentation  he  had  duly  registered"
"the  vehicle  in  terms  of  the  Motor  Traffic  Act.  Therefore  the  question"
