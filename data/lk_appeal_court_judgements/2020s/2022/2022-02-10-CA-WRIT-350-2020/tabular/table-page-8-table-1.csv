"initiated to recover the possession of those lands also in term of the proviso (a) to the"
"section 38 of the Act."
"According to the schedule to the section 2 Notice, the extent of the land intended to be"
"identified for the acquisition is about 464 Hectares. In the annexure to the Notice, the"
"extents of the land which forms the land described in the schedule and the names of the"
"owners of those lands are given individually. The total extent of the lands mentioned in"
"that annexure is approximately 464 Hectares. Therefore, it is apparent that the section"
"2 Notice relates only to the lands mentioned in the annexure. In that annexure, neither"
"the Petitionerâ€™s name nor a land in extent of 60 Acres is mentioned. The learned DSG"
"appearing for the Respondent submitted to Court that only the names of the land owners"
"who could be identified by that time were included into the annexure. The Court cannot"
"accept that submission of the learned DSG for the reason that the extent mentioned in"
"the schedule to the Notice tallies with the extent of the lands mentioned in the annexure."
"Therefore, it is apparent that the land owned by the Petitioner is not situated within the"
"area which the section 2 Notice was exhibited."

"the impugned land owned by the Petitioner for acquisition on the premise of the details"
"mentioned in the section 2 Notice. It is important to note that the section 2 Notice is"
"dated 19.05.2009 and the request made by P18 to survey the impugned land is dated"
"12.10.2017.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  the  2nd  Respondent  has  requested  from  the"
"Surveyor General by the P 18 to survey the impugned land after about eight years from"
"the date of the section 2 Notice was exhibited. P 18 further states that it was later found"
"that  even  though  there  are  lands  which  the  owners  and  the  possessors  could  be"
"identified,  those  lands  were  not  included  into  the  preliminary  survey  done  for  the"
"acquisition. Therefore, that document elicits the fact that even though, the impugned"
"land  had  not  been  initially  included  into  the  preliminary  survey  which  the  section 2"
