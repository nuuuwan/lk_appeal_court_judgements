"executing a subsequent survey."
"A letter dated 18.01.2021 has been tendered to the Court by the 2nd Respondent marked"
"as 2R6(b) to prove that the impugned land is situated within the area mentioned in the"
"section  2  Notice.  The  letter  has  been  issued  by  the  Government  Surveyor  to  the  2nd"
"Respondent.  In  that  letter  it  is  stated  that  the  impugned  land  is  situated  within  the"

"and in as much as the State would in any event take possession of the land, she would"
"be placed in a situation where she would neither have the property, nor compensation."
"When coming to a conclusion, the Court cannot consider 2R7 in insolation and it should"
