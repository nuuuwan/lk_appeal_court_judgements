"to four minutes after the deceased was stabbed. It was imperative to consider this, in view of"
"Kumarasiri's evidence of a Dying declaration."
"The injuries on the deceased were two cut injuries. One on the head and the other one on"
"the  chest.  The 
learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  accused-appellant  argued  that  this"
"contradicts the eyewitness's evidence that the deceased was hit on the head with a club. It"
"depends on how strong the blow was and if it didn’t hit with a reasonable force there may"
"not be a visible injury on the head. Even if there is no injury the eyewitness's evidence that"
"the deceased was hit on the head with a club cannot be ignored."
"The learned High Court Judge has erred in stating that the suggestion by the learned counsel"
"for  the  defence  that  the  deceased  and  Piyarathne  first  attacked  the  appellants  was  a"
"suggestion made only to Piyarathne and therefore faulted the Defence for not having made"
"this suggestion at the early stage of the defence. It reflects that the learned High Court Judge"
"has  wrongly  applied  the  principle  enunciated  by  Justice  F.N.D  Jayasuriya  in  the  case  of"
"(Kobeigane Murder) Ajith Samarakoon vs. State 2004 (2) SLR 209. The said suggestion could"
"only  be  made  to  Piyarathne  as  he  was  the  sole  eyewitness  who  gave  evidence  for  the"
"prosecution."
"It  was  the  contention  of  the  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  who  appeared  for  the"
"respondent  that  the  prosecution  case  was  based  on  the  strong  eyewitness  testimony  of"
"A.R.M. Priyarathne (PW 1). He has strongly implicated the culpability of both accused. Not"
"only that the PW 1 sole eyewitness was an independent and unbiased witness who testified"
"before the court without any exaggeration of the incident. It is important to note that the said"
"argument has some merit. At the same time, it cannot be ignored that the deceased and the"
"appellants were engaged in a fight before this unfortunate incident took place. That fact was"
"not seriously considered by the learned trial Judge."
"The 
learned 
trial 
Judge  observes 
that 
the  accused-appellants  entertained  a  common"
"murderous intention with a pre-plan and premeditation. I do not agree with that as there was"
"no  evidence  to  prove  it  was  a  pre-planned  murder.  The  medical  evidence  does  not  elicit"
"clearly or indicate the murderous intention of the accused-appellants."
"It 
is  true  that  the  Section  27  recoveries  further  corroborate  the  stance  taken  by  the"
"eyewitness. Chief Inspector Jayawardana (PW 14), PS 16557 Ranbanda (PW 17) and PC 7739"
"Balasuriya  (PW  16)  testified  regarding  the  police  investigations  and  the  recoveries  made"
"based  on  accused-appellants  statements.  The  learned trial  Judge  observes  that  the  stance"
"taken by the defence in respect of the knife recovered by police is contradictory (pages 263"
"to 264)"
"The learned counsel for the respondent states that the accused-appellants failed to give any"
"prudent explanation to the incrimination evidence elicited against them and the learned trial"
"Judge  correctly  observed 
that 
there  are  no  contradictions  or 
inconsistencies 
in 
the"
"testimonies of the prosecution witnesses."
"It is evident that the 1st accused-appellant had attempted to assault the deceased with the"
"club, whilst further assaults the 2nd accused-appellant had stabled him with a knife."
