"The prosecution witnesses, Rupasinghe and Kumarasiri are brothers of the deceased Sarath"
"Chandrasiri. Piyarathne is also related to both the accused and deceased and also a friend of"
"Kumarasiri  and  the  deceased  Sarath  Chandrasiri.  The  two  appellants  are  brothers  of"
"Rupasinghe's wife. As such, both the accused party and the deceased party are interrelated."
"On the day in question, the appellants had an incident with Rupasinghe and his wife. This is"
"regarding a land dispute involving the mother of the appellants as well as Rupasinghe's wife."
"It  was  about the  distribution  of property by their  mother  who  was  at  the  time  living  with"
"Rupasinghe and his wife. Owing to the said incident, Rupasinghe and his wife got injured. At"
"that time Piyaratne was with the deceased Sarath Chandrasiri and Kumarasiri about half a"
"kilometre  away.  On  hearing  of  this  incident,  Piyarathne  and  the  deceased  proceeded  to"
"Rupasinghe's house on a motorcycle and Kumarasiri followed on a pushbike. Upon nearing"
"the house of Rupasinghe, the alleged incident had occurred. About how the incident occurred,"
"there are contradictions and inconsistencies in the evidence."
"Two contradictions have been marked and two omissions have been highlighted with regard"
"to the evidence of the eyewitness. The learned President’s Counsel for the accused-appellants"
"argued that the learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the said contradictions and"
"omissions. If that evidence were properly evaluated it would have necessarily concluded that"
"the said witnesses' evidence is not credible and therefore should not be accepted."
"The  witness  Kumarasiri  who  speaks  of  a  Dying  declaration  in  four  different  places  stated"
"different versions of what exactly was told to him by the deceased. However, the learned High"
"Court  Judge  has  failed  to  consider  the  inherent  weaknesses  and  the  principles  relating  to"
"Dying declarations as enunciated in the decision of Ranasinghe vs. Attorney General 2007 (1)"
"SLR  216."
"Three contradictions and one omission has been highlighted in the evidence of Kumarasiri."
"Further,  Kumarasiri's  evidence  contradicts  the  evidence  of  Piyarathne  the  eyewitness."
"Kumarasiri states that when he went to the scene of the incident, he did not see Piyarathne."
"However, Piyarathne states that he came and told Kumarasiri to be with the deceased before"
"he went to look for a vehicle. The police evidence speaks of Section 27 recovery. This has been"
"challenged by the appellants."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the accused-appellants states that the learned trial Judge"
"has failed to analyse the evidence in a fair and just manner. In setting out the legal principles,"
"he has misdirected himself about how contradictions and omissions should be considered. He"
"further says that the learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself that merely because"
"the witnesses were related to both the deceased as well as the appellants, they were impartial"
"witnesses. Since the dispute was between related parties and as the witnesses were closer in"
"a  relationship  as  well  as  affinity to the deceased  as demonstrated through their  evidence,"
"they were not impartial witnesses as found to be by the learned High Court Judge."
"It is my view that the learned High Court Judge has gone out of the way to find excuses for"
"the contradictions and omissions and therefore failed to give the benefit of the doubt to the"
"appellants as required in law in a criminal case. The learned trial Judge failed to consider the"
"medical evidence properly since the doctor had said that death would have resulted in three"
