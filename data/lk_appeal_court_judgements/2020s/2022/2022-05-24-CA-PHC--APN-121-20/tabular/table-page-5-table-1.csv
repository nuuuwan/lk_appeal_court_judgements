"In  the  case  of  Somnipathy  v  Weerasinghe  (1980)  2  SLR  121,  the"
"interpretation of the locus standi or the “standing to sue”, found reads"
"that even the spouse of a victim has no standing to file a fundamental"
"rights  petition  on  behalf  of  the  victim.  In  long  overdue,  Sriyani  Silva  v"
"Iddamalgoda,  Officer  in  Charge,  Police  Station,  Payagala  and  Others"
"(2003)  SLR  14,  the  Court’s  position  on  the 
locus  standi 
is  observed"
"considerably 
changed,  when 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
of 
Sri 
Lanka"
"pronounces 
that 
“anyone 
having 
a 
legitimate 
interest 
could"
"prosecute…in terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution”. In this case,"
"the  detainee,  Jagath  Kumara  (petitioner’s  husband)  died  while  being"
"held  at  the  Remand  Prison.  S.  Bandaranayake 
J,  with  S.N.  Silva 
J"
"agreeing, stated that “The golden rule of plain, literal and grammatical"
"construction  has  to  be  read  subject  to  the  qualification  that  the"
"language of the statute is not always that which a grammarian would"
"use”.  Moreover,  Bandaranayaka  J  brought  to 
light  the  preposterous"
"situation  that  can  lead  to  a  “mischief”  if  it  is  contended  that  the  right"
"[for  remedy]  would  become 
ineffective  due  to  the 
intervention  of"
"death”."
"Later in the cases such as Sugathapala Mendis and Others v Chandrika"
"Kumarathunga  and  Others  (2008)2  SLR339,  391(Water’s  Edge  case),"
"the  scope  of 
locus  standi  was  further  consolidated,  bringing 
in  the"
"concepts  of 
“public 
interest”  and 
“public 
trust”. 
In 
the 
case  of"
"Gunasekara  Hamini  v  Don  Baron  D.C.  Colombo,  13,125,  the  Court"
"considered  that,  “a  donation  by  a  minor  unassisted  by  a  guardian  is"
"null and void. On the death of the minor's father, the mother does not"
"become 
the  guardian  except  by  the  Court  appointing  her  under"
