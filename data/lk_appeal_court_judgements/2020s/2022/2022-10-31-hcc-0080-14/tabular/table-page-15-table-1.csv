"The last ground of appeal was that the trial Court was flawed by remanding a"
"prosecution witness during the trial. The proceedings show that the father of the"
"appellant who was PW-02 named in the indictment has been remanded after he"
"being treated as a witness detrimental to the prosecution and cross-examined"
"under  section  154  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance.  He  has  been  remanded  on  the"
"basis that he has given false evidence in Court and he would be prosecuted in"
"that  regard  in  terms  of  the  provisions  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act."
"However, the case record bears testimony that, on the next day where the trial"
"was taken up for hearing, he had been released on a Rs.5000/- cash bail. For"
"that course of action, to have a bearing on the case, there must be reasons to"
"believe that the witnesses called thereafter to give evidence had been influenced"
"by this fact and therefore it has caused material prejudice to the appellant. There"
"is no material to come to such a conclusion and the learned High Court Judge"
"has not considered that fact as relevant in his judgement, hence, no basis for"
"the 5th ground of appeal."
"I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence"
"placed before the Court in its totality and has come to a correct finding as to the"
"guilt of the appellant to the crime he has been charged with. I find no basis to"
"interfere with the conviction and the sentence of the accused appellant as I have"
"considered before."
"Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, as it is devoid of any merit. The conviction"
"and the sentence affirmed."
