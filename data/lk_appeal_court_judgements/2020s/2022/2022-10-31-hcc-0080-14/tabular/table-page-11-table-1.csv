"by the Court had been that if the prosecution fails to establish the exact time of"
"death, the fact that the deceased was last seen with the accused would lose  a"
"considerable part of its significance, and not that it is a factor that entirely negate"
"the significance of that fact. In the said case, the Court has considered the fact"
"that the accused had no motive and he has given an explanation promptly  as"
"factors that should have been considered in favour of the accused."
"I am of the view that the facts of the matter under appeal are very much different"
"to the facts of the case relied on by the learned Counsel. There is solid evidence"
"given by several witnesses that the deceased came to their village around 9 p.m."
"looking  for  the  appellant  claiming  that  he  got  married  to  her  in  Muttur  and"
"abandoned  her  after  about  a  week.  PW-01  and  several  others,  as  responsible"
"members of the community have decided to take the female who came looking"
"for  the  appellant  to  the  house  of  a  village  elder.  They  have  taken  steps  to  get"
"down the appellant to that house so that the female can confront him. It was in"
"evidence that when PW-01 and others went to the house of the appellant and"
"informed  him  about  the  arrival  of  a  female  looking  for  him,  the  wife  who  was"
"living with him at that time and his mother have got agitated as a result. The"
"evidence shows that they have come to the house of the village elder and had"
"created a commotion there as well."
"The  evidence  also  clearly  establishes  that  as  a  result  of  this  situation,  the"
"appellant has accompanied the female and gone out of the house of the village"
"elder stating that he is going to take her to a relativeâ€™s house. According to the"
"evidence  of  PW-05,  the  appellant  was  last  seen  with  the  said  female  around"
"10.45-11.00  in  the  night.  The  witnesses  are  also  clear  that  the  female  who"
"accompanied the appellant was wearing a red-coloured salvar and also carrying"
"a blue-coloured bag."
"On the following day, PW-01 being the person who was instrumental in taking"
"the female to the house of the village elder has inquired about the said female"
"and had been informed that she left the village for Muttur."
