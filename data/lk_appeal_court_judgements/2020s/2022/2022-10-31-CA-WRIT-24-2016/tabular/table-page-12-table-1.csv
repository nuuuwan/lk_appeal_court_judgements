"certiorari made by the Respondents to this case. Thus, the application for a writ of certiorari has to"
"fail."
"Necessary parties"
"The  Respondent’s  next  objection  was  that  the  Petitioner’s  entire  application  has  to  fail  as  the"
"Petitioner has failed to bring in all the parties that are necessary to adjudicate this matter before"
"the court. It is the contention of the Respondents that K.D. Prasanna Kumara is the recipient of"
"one of the grants pertaining to the land in question. As per R1, Siripala had informed the Divisional"
"Secretary that he has two sons and a daughter and had indicated that he wishes to subdivide the"
"land he possessed and distribute it between the three children."
"Subsequent  to  the  surrender  of  the  grant  by  Sirpala  vesting  the  land  back  to  the  state,  three"
"presidential  grants  pertaining  to  the  land  in  dispute  had  been  given  to  the  said  three  children."
"However, the said Prasanna Kumara, one of the grantees who benefitted and obtained a grant, had"
"not been made a party to this application. This Court observes that if this application is to be held"
"in  favor  of  the  Petitioner,  the  said  grantee  whose  name  is  reflected  in  R3  would  be  adversely"
"affected. It is trite law that in the absence of necessary parties the application for a writ has to fail."
