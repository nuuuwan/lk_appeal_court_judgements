"children. By the form dated 16. 03. 2007, Siripala formally surrendered the land grant and it had"
"been accepted  by the  Divisional  Secretary (R2).  As  per the  material  submitted, the  Petitioner’s"
"father died on 09.06.07 (Para 13 of the amended petition)."
"It is common ground that the said Sripala had tendered the necessary forms to surrender the grant"
"while he was alive. The Respondents contend that the Divisional Secretary had accepted the said"
"surrender  and  made  an  endorsement  in  R2  on  the  same  date.  Thus,  it  was  the  Respondent’s"
"contention that once the Divisional Secretary accepts the surrender of the grant, the land is vested"
"with the state, and the absolute title also now vests with the state. It is observed that pursuant to"
"the  provisions under  sections 85 and 86,  surrendered land  will vest  with  the  state  free  from all"
"encumbrances."
"Though the surrender had been accepted on the same day, it had been duly registered only on the"
"26th  of  November  2007  (P4b).  The  Petitioner  contends  that  by  this  date,  Siripala  had  died,"
"(paragraph  13  of  the  Petition)  and  thus  argues  that,  in  view  of  the  provisions  of  the  Land"
"Development Ordinance, the surrender is not valid as the registration of the surrender had occurred"
"subsequent to the death of Siripala. The Petitioner relies on section 60 of the Land Development"
"Ordinance, as the validity of a nomination or a  cancelation is dealt with under section 60 of the"
"Land Development Ordinance."
"The  said  section  reads  as  follows  “No  nomination  or  cancellation  of  the  nomination  of  a"
"successor  or  of  a  life-holder  shall  be  valid  unless  the  document  (other  than  a  last  will)"
"effecting such nomination or cancellation is duly registered before the date of the death of"
"the owner of the holding in respect of which such nomination or cancellation was made”."
