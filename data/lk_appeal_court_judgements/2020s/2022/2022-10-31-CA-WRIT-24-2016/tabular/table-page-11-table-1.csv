"This Court observes that as per the material tendered to this Court, it is established that, by the"
"time the Petitioner awoke  from his  slumber, the Respondents had already obtained their grants."
"The Petitioner is seeking a writ of mandamus compelling 1st to 4th Respondents to issue him with"
"a permit for a land that had already been alienated by a presidential grant."
"It is also pertinent to note  that the grants are not issued by the 1st to 4th Respondents. The Court"
"will not grant a writ compelling a party to perform an act that they cannot perform under the law."
"It was held in Ratnasiri and others Vs Ellawala and others (2004) 2 SLR 180 “This Court is"
"mindful of the fact that the prerogative remedies it is empowered to grant in these proceedings"
"are  not  available as  of  a  right.  Court  has  a  discretion  in  regard  to  the  grant  of  relief  in  the"
"exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction. It has been held time and time again by our Courts that"
"“A writ… will not issue where it would be vexatious or futile.”"
"In Siddeek V. Jacolyn Seneviratne and Three Others (1984) 1 SLR 83 it was held, “The Court"
"will  have  regard  to  the  special  circumstances  of  the  case  before  it,  before  issuing  a  writ  of"
"certiorari. The writ of certiorari clearly will not be issued where the end result will be futility,"
"frustration, injustice, and illegality”."
