"of the 6th Respondent to the Petitioner. The Petitioner contends that the said Siripala had withdrawn"
"the nomination of the 6th Respondent on 16th March 2007. The parties are not at variance on the"
"fact that the deceased had also surrendered the land to the state on the same day and the surrender"
"had taken place before his death."
"It is pertinent to note that the Petitioner is challenging the relationship of Siripala, his father to the"
"6th Respondent on the basis that his father had not legally divorced his first wife who is the mother"
"of the Petitioner. It is the contention of the Petitioner that, though his father Siripala had filed for"
"divorce,  from  his  wife,  that  is  the  mother  of  the  Petitioner,  the  decree  nisi  had  not  been  made"
"absolute before the death of the said Siripala, thus the contention, that the 6th Respondent is not"
"the legal wife of Siripala."
"However, the Petitioner has failed to disclose to this Court, as to why he had failed to take any"
"steps to challenge the nomination of the 6th Respondent when she was nominated for succession"
"by his late father on the basis of her being his wife in the year 2006. The Petitioner has waited till"
"2016  to  contend  the  illegality  of  the  nomination  of  the  6th  Respondent.  This  is  after  the  said"
"nomination had been withdrawn."
"This  Court  agrees  with  the  Petitioner  that  the  nomination  to  succession  has  to  be  done  in"
"accordance with provisions of the Land Development Ordinance. It is admitted by all parties that"
"in the absence of a proper nomination, the succession has to be in accordance with Schedule 3 of"
"the Land Development Ordinance. However, it is the contention of the Respondents that the issue"
"of succession does not arise in this instance."
