"The Petitioner has failed to submit to this Court the reason for his failure to take steps to succeed,"
"especially in view of the fact that the said Siripala had died in the year 2007 and the Petitioner has"
"waited for nearly eight years after the demise of his father to take any steps to stake a claim. Thus,"
"once again,  even by operation  of law, as  per the  provisions of  section 86, the land  in  question"
"becomes vested with the state."
"This would be an appropriate time for this Court to consider the objections of the Respondents."
