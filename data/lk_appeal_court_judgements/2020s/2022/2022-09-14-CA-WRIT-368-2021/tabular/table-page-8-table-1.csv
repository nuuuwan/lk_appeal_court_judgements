"List. Hence, I reject the preliminary objection on the jurisdiction of this Court raised by"
"the learned State Counsel and hold that this Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine"
"the instant application."
"Now I advert to examine whether the instant application should be heard and determined"
"by this Court and also whether the other preliminary objection should be dealt with at this"
"stage."
"The defense taken up in ‘P8’ and ‘P10’ by the Petitioner against the impugned Certificate,"
"marked  ‘P7’,  is  that  (a).  he  is  not  entitled  to  pay  the  amount  mentioned  in  ‘P7’  as  the"
"subject property has been gifted to him by his mother (5th Respondent). (b). the assessment"
"in respect of the subject land cannot be accepted. By Deed of Transfer No. 308 (marked"
"‘P4’) attested by Sanjeewani S. Dayananda, Notary Public on 15.09.2014, the subject land"
"has been transferred to the Petitioner by the said 5th Respondent."
"The  Petitioner  by  way  of  the  letter  dated  16.07.2020,  marked  as  ‘G’,  annexed  to  ‘P26’"
"clearly gives the reasons as to why the mother of the Petitioner has transferred the subject"
"property  by  way  of  a  deed  of  transfer.  The  Petitioner’s  argument  is  that  although  the"
"subject property has been transferred by way of Deed of Transfer No. 308, the said transfer"
"should be considered as a gift for the purpose of calculating stamp duty."
"It is observed, prima facie, that the said Deed No. 308 is nothing but an unconditional"
"Deed of Transfer. The subject of stamp duties on transfer of properties has been listed in"
"the said Provincial Council list."
"The 2nd Respondent referring to Clause 48(2) of the Finance Statute of Uva Province No."
"8  of  1990  has  categorically  informed  the  Petitioner  that  the  stamp  duty,  in  respect  of  a"
"property that is being transferred subject to a consideration, should be calculated according"
"to the land value of the property. Further, the 2nd Respondent as opposed to the contention"
"of ‘P10’ has informed the Petitioner by letter, marked ‘P11’, that the Petitioner has failed"
"to submit a proper appeal in terms of the provisions of the said Finance Statute."
"The learned State Counsel draws the attention of Court to the documents marked ‘P10’,"
"‘P13’,  ‘P15’  &  ‘P19’  and  asserts  that  the  Petitioner  has  deliberately  avoided  a  direct"
"assertion as to whether the transfer of ownership of the subject land was by way of a gift"
