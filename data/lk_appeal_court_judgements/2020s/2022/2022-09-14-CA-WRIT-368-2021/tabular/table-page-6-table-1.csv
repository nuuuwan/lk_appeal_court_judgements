"In  the said Madduma Bandara vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services and"
"another, Shirani Bandaranayake J. (as she then was) observed as follows;"
"“Furthermore, in terms of Article 154(P) (4), High Courts of the Provinces shall have the"
"jurisdiction  to  issue  according  to  law  orders  in  the  nature  of  habeas  corpus,  in  respect  of"
"persons illegally detained within the province; and orders in the nature of writs of certiorari,"
"prohibition, procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto. The jurisdiction of the High Court"
"of the Provinces, to issue such orders however is  restricted as the Article  specifies that this"
"power could be used only against any person exercising within the Province any power under"
"any law or any statute, made by the Provincial Council established for that Province in respect"
"of any matter set out in the Provincial Council List. It is therefore abundantly clear that for"
"the High Court to issue a writ quashing the order made by the 1st respondent, it is necessary"
"that the subject matter should belong to one of the subjects listed out in the Provincial Council"
"List.” (at p. 83)"
"“The word ‘agrarian’ relates to landed property and such property no doubt would attract"
"paddy lands and tenant cultivators of such land.” (at p. 91)"
"“……..In the circumstances, it appears that the subject dealing with paddy lands falls within"
"the ambit of the Provincial Council List and therefore the High Courts of the Provinces have"
"the jurisdiction to issue orders in the nature of writs by virtue of the power given to them in"
"terms of Article 154P of the Constitution.” (at p. 91)"
