"law""; hence it was always constitutionally permissible for that jurisdiction to be reduced or"
"transferred by ordinary law (of course, to a body entitled to exercise judicial power). That is"
"the reason why I held (in Swastika Textile Industries Ltd. v. Dayaratne, that section 3 of the"
"High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990, conferred concurrent,"
"appellate and revisionary jurisdiction on the High Courts in respect of Labour Tribunals, and"
"that thereafter section 31D3 of the Industrial Disputes Act, as amended by Act No. 32 of"
"1990, made that jurisdiction exclusive, thereby taking away the jurisdiction of the Court of"
"Appeal in that respect). And it was the absence of such a provision that made Parliament"
"unable to reduce or affect the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 140: because"
"“its jurisdictions under Articles 140 and 141 are entrenched; but for the proviso inserted by"
"the  First  Amendment,  its  jurisdiction  under  Article  140  cannot  be  transferred  even  to  the"
"Supreme Court"" (Determination in re the Agrarian Services (Amendment).” (at p. 299,300)"
