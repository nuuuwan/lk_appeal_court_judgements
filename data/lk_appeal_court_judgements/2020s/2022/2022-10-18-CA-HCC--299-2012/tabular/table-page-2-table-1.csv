"T
his appeal is from the judgment, delivered by the learned Judge of the High Court of Negombo,"
"dated 07.12.2012, by which, the accused-appellant, was convicted and sentenced to 10 years"
"rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs. 10,000/- and in default, 3 months simple imprisonment."
"The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Negombo on the following count;"
"(1)  That  on  or  about  06.12.1997  within  the  jurisdiction  of  this  court,  at  Katunayake  for"
"keeping in possession of a revolver in terms of regulation 29 (4) read with 29 (1) of the"
"Emergency  Regulation  as 
issued 
in  the  Gazette 
(extraordinary)  No.  43/  12  dated"
"04.11.1994."
"The said revolver was alleged to have been found in the person of the accused-appellant by a"
"team of investigators attached to the CID led by Inspector Fonseka (PW 1). The said recovery was"
"made  during  a  raid  carried  out  at  the  waiting 
lounge  of 
the 
taxi  drivers  operating  at"
"Bandaranayaka 
International  Airport  at  Katunayaka.  The 
raid  was  conducted  under 
the"
"directions of PW 1, Inspector Fonseka. The trial had been held in absentia against the accused-"
"appellant since the commencement of the trial on 13.07.2009."
"On 08.03.2011 an application was made to represent the accused-appellant and requested to"
"cross-examine the witnesses who had given evidence before, in terms of section 241 (2) of the"
"Criminal Procedure Code. This application was refused on the ground that the appellant had not"
"placed sufficient grounds before the High Court to consider such application under section 241"
"(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code."
"During  the  trial,  5  witnesses  gave  evidence  including  a  Senior  Assistant  Government  Analyst."
"After  the  trial,  the  accused-appellant  was  convicted  and  sentenced  to  10  years  of  rigorous"
"imprisonment  and  a 
fine  of  Rs.10,000/-  with  a  default 
sentence  of  3  months 
simple"
"imprisonment. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the accused-appellant"
"preferred this appeal."
"The charge against the accused-appellant was that he had a revolver in his possession without"
"proper authority or license. Evidence of the Chief Investigating Officer IP Fonseka was that he"
"was present when the said revolver was recovered from the Appellant. He further testified that"
"the weapon recovered from the accused-appellant was one of Smith and Wessen and carried"
"Serial No. 68680. Inspector Fonseka said that it turned out to be a weapon issued to a retired"
"Police Officer. There was no evidence of change or forgery attempted on the said Serial Number."
"The said weapon was recovered by Police Sergeant Nazeer (PW 3). The production was entered"
"into the Production Registry under PR 197 personally by Inspector Fonseka."
"Then the said weapon was wrapped in a paper sealed with IP Fonseka's seal marked as PR 197"
"and handed over to Sergeant Hemachandra. Sergeant Nazeer helped IP Fonseka with sealing."
"Sergeant Hemachandra 3417 (PW 4) gave evidence as the officer who took over the production"
"from IP Fonseka."
"It is important to note that Sergeant Hemachandra gave two contradictory pieces of evidence"
"on the issue of the contents of PR 197. First, he said that PR 197 refers to a revolver of point 45"
"calibre which is a make of mark 05 bearing 147106 as the Serial Number. Then he made a mistake"
