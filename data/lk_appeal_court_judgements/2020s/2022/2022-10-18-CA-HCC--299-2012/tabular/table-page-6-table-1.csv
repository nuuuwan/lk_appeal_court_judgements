"A team of police officers was detailed to ascertain the accuracy of this information. Sequel to"
"this verification, 3 groups of police officers were arranged. Inspector Fonseka functioned as the"
"chief investigator. On 06.12.1997 a raid was conducted in the morning as more passengers arrive"
"at  that  time.  Members  of  the  team  and  the  vehicles  were  searched  before  departure,  for"
"possession of any unauthorized weapons. The 3 teams clad in civil clothes left in a car, a cab and"
"a  trishaw.  Having  arrived  at  the  airport  around  8.30  hours  Inspector  Fonseka  and  Inspector"
"Daramitipola went to the passenger arrival area whilst the other two teams were deployed on"
"the road outside. They focused their attention on the restroom of the drivers, situated within"
"the airport premises. On a previous occasion, Inspector Daramitipola had been on surveillance"
"which occasion facilitated him to identify the relevant suspects."
"On the date of the raid, Inspector Fonseka waited with his team and Inspector Daramitipola's"
"team until all those identified suspects got inside the drivers' restroom.  Around 10.10 hrs after"
"the  suspects  went  in,  Inspector  Fonseka  instructed  that  he  would  go  first  and  for  the  other"
"officers to follow. Around 10.20 hrs Inspector Fonseka entered the room and introduced himself."
"He ordered everybody to raise their hands and be quiet. Other officers who entered the room,"
"searched the persons."
"Police Sergeant Nazeer under the supervision of Inspector Fonseka, searched the accused and"
"recovered a .38 revolver which the accused was hiding in his waist. The name of the suspect who"
"was in possession of the revolver was Pradeep de Silva alias Captain Ranji. 6 live cartridges were"
"also recovered. The revolver was not of Sri Lankan origin and was found to be a `smith & Wesson'"
"American make for which he did not have a valid license. Thus, the arrest was caused in terms"
"of Regulation (18)1 of the Emergency Regulations."
"The  learned  Counsel  who  appeared  on  behalf  of  the  accused-appellant  was  arguing  that  the"
"evidence  was  contradictory  on  the  serial  number  of  the  weapon.  The  serial  number  in  the"
"weapon has gone on record as 686800,68680,68802,383800."
"The Government Analyst corroborates the production marked P1 received at the Government"
"Analyst's Department was a .38 â€˜Smith and Wesson revolver number which is 686800."
"The number of the revolver had been 686800 and the witnesses had referred to this number."
"The proceedings in this brief do not disclose the correction of any proceedings. Therefore, it is"
"my view that these errors are purely typographical. There is no basis for that argument raised by"
"the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  regarding  the  contradictory  possession  of  the  serial"
"number of the revolver."
"It was further argued by the appellant that the chain of production has not been proved beyond"
"reasonable  doubt  by  the  prosecution.  Consequent  to  the  recovery  of  the  revolver  by  Police"
"Sergeant Nazeer, Inspector Fonseka took charge of the revolver & ammunition. As the place was"
"crowded with people, they have not spent time sealing the production at the place of detection."
"It was sealed at the CID office assisted by Nazeer and was entered in PR 197. Thereafter, it was"
"handed  over  to  the  reserve  Sergeant  Hemachandra.  The  reserve  officer  has  corroborated"
"Inspector Fonseka on this fact. The property receipt marked P 2 enhanced the credibility of this"
"fact which is a contemporaneous note made in handing over the production on 06.12.1997."
"It is evident that the weapon was sent to the Government Analyst's Department through Police"
"Sergeant Rodrigo on 02.04.1998 by the Magistrate's Court of Negombo under case No 3226/97."
