"(v) 
for which payment is received in foreign currency, through a bank."
"It  is  obvious  that  the  case  cannot  come  under  both  limbs  at  once  since"
"Section 7 (1) (c)  applies to services not covered by paragraph 7 (1) (b)."
"Nevertheless, the learned Counsel for the Appellant argued that his case"
"should come under Section 7 (1) (c) or in the alternative, under 7 (1) (b)"
"(vi). I will return to this point towards the end of this part of the judgement."
"I  will  now  focus  on  the  facts  of  this  matter  to  the  extent  that  they  are"
"relevant to the instant appeal."
"Travelport owns and operates Galileo Computerised Reservation System"
"(Galileo  CRS),  a  computerised  system  for  the  use  of  airlines,  travel"
"agencies and other entities in the travel and tourism industries. According"
"to the Appellant, ITQLPL is engaged in providing the service of facilitating"
"the  processing  of  travel  reservation  related  data  and 
its  transmission"
"services to Travelport. Travelport was desirous of appointing an operator"
"to provide with the services in respect of Galileo system in Sri Lanka and"
"consequently,  entered  into  the  Operator  Agreement  dated  20th  January"
"2009 (at page 222 of the appeal brief) with Interglobe Technology Quotient"
"Private  Limited,  a  company 
incorporated 
in  India  (in 
the  agreement"
"Travelport  is  termed  as  ‘Galileo’  and  Interglobe  Technology  Quotient"
"Private Limited is termed as ‘the Operator’). Later, Interglobe Technology"
"Quotient  Private  Limited  (the  Original  Operator)  by  Deed  of  Novation"
"dated  1st  March  2009  (at  page  150  of  the  appeal  brief)  novated  the"
"agreement to the new operator ITQLPL, the Appellant, and assigned all of"
"its rights, benefits and interests in the agreement to the Appellant. Thus,"
"for the purposes of the agreement, the Appellant put itself in the position"
"of the original operator, Interglobe Technology Quotient Private Limited."
"Therefore, the observation of the TAC in its determination that there is no"
"distinct agreement between Travelport and ITQLPL but, ITQLPL has just"
"signed 
the  agreement  between  Travelport  and  Interglobe  Technology"
"Quotient Private Limited is irrational."
"At  the  argument,  parties  were  not  at  variance  that  ITQLPL  receives"
"payments  from  outside  Sri  Lanka,  in  foreign  currency,  through  a  bank,"
"which are requirements under both Sections 7 (1) (b) (vi) and 7 (1) (c), for"
"a service to be zero rated."
