"In the volume titled Income Tax In Sri Lanka, Gooneratne states that:33"
"‘The principle is well established that where a tribunal arrives at a finding"
"which is not supported by evidence the finding though stated in the form of"
"a finding of fact is a finding which involves a question of law. The question"
"of law is whether there was evidence to support the finding, apart from the"
"adequacy of the evidence. The Court will interfere if the finding has been"
"reached without any evidence or upon a view of facts which could not be"
"reasonably entertained. The evidence can be examined to see whether the"
"Board [being the Board of Review; the predecessor of the TAC] being"
"properly appraised of what they had to do could reasonably have arrived"
"at the conclusion they did.’ (emphasis added)."
"Therefore,  if  someone  asserts  that  the  Court  cannot  consider  the  facts"
"available in a case in order to arrive at its decision on a stated case, it would"
"be a misconception."
"According  to  Article  36.1  of  the  Operator  Agreement,  the  relationship"
"between  Travelport  and  ITQLPL  is  that  of  independent  contractors.  An"
"independent contractor is a person who enters into a contract for services."
"In this case, the Respondent disputes the Appellant’s position that ITQLPL"
"supplies  its  services  to  Travelport.  The  TAC  upheld  the  Respondent’s"
"position.  In  the  circumstances,  this  Court  has  an  obligation  to  carefully"
"examine the articles of the Operator Agreement to determine whether the"
"TAC erred in determining to whom ITQLPL provides its services."
"On  a  careful  consideration  of  the  Articles  in  the  Operator  Agreement,"
"especially Articles 7 to 21, it is apparent that the parties to the agreement"
"have  mutual  obligations;  in  particular  Travelport  has  to  supply  certain"
"goods/services to ITQLPL34 as opposed to ITQLPL providing services to"
"Travelport. It is important to note that no prominent service to be provided"
"by ITQLPL to Travelport contrast with the services provided by ITQLPL"
"to  the  subscribers.  This  may  be  the  reason  why  the  contracting  parties"
"describe their capacities as ‘independent contractors’ instead of ITQLPL"
