"the Board of Review, up to twenty-four months; twice the time limit which"
"existed previously."
"In the same amendment, by the introduction of Section 15, the Legislature"
"enacted that the Commission has power to hear and determine any pending"
"appeal  that  was  deemed  to  have  been  transferred  to  the  TAC  from  the"
"Board of Review under Section 10 of the principal Act, notwithstanding"
"the expiry of twelve months granted for its determination."
"Since  the  amendment  to  Section  10  was  brought  in  with  retrospective"
"effect, in any event, the twenty-four-month period will apply to all appeals"
"transferred  from  the  Board  of  Review.  Therefore,  the  introduction  of"
"Section 15 by the amendment will serve no meaningful purpose and seems"
"redundant.  Nevertheless,  in  my  view,  introducing  Section  15  under  the"
"Amendment  Act  No.  20  of  2013  manifests  that  the  intention  of  the"
"Legislature is not to make the timeline mandatory."
"On the other hand, one may argue that the application of Section 15 of the"
"amendment is limited to the proviso in Section 10 and that therefore, the"
"Legislature has manifested its intention that the time frame in the proviso"
"to be merely directory, but that which is in the main part to be mandatory."
"Yet,  this  cannot  be  a  valid  argument  since  in  the  circumstances,  the"
"Legislature has extended the time frame in the proviso and reduced it in the"
"main part, by the same Amendment. When the time limit is lowered, the"
"question of exceeding the existing time limit will not arise, and therefore,"
"a necessity to enact as above will also not arise."
"Therefore,  I  am  not  prepared  to  accept  the  contention  of  the  learned"
"Counsel  for  the  Appellant,  that  the  fact  that  the  Legislature  has  given"
"retrospective effect to the amended provisions means that it intended the"
"time limit contained in Section 10 to be mandatory."
"Having argued extensively, as above, that the time limit specified for the"
"TAC is mandatory, the learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that"
"when  the  two-hundred-and-seventy-day  time  limit  is  exceeded,  the  self-"
"assessment  submitted  by  the  Appellant  shall  take  effect,  thus  nullifying"
"both the Assessor’s assessment and the CGIR’s confirmation of the said"
"assessment13."
