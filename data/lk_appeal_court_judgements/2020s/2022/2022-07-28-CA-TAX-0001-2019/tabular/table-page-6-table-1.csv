"In 
the  case  of  D.M.S.  Fernando  and  Another  v.  Mohideen  Ismail,3"
"Samarakoon  C.J.,  citing  Maxwell  on  the  Interpretation  of  Statutes  (12th"
"Edn.),  presented  a  three-limbed  test  that  could  assist  in  determining  the"
"intention of the Legislature:"
"“Then again it is said that to discover the intention of the Legislature it is"
"necessary  to  consider  -  (1)  The  Law  as  it  stood  before  the  Statute  was"
"passed. (2) The mischief if any under the old law which the Statute sought"
"to remedy and (3) The remedy itself.”"
"In applying this test to the present case, it apparent that the law as it existed"
"prior to the amendments was modified by extension and reduction, as the"
"Legislature  deemed  appropriate,  the  timeframe  within  which  the  TAC"
"should make a decision. There appears to be no obvious mischief that the"
"amendments were intended to remedy, and the remedy itself appears to be"
"nothing other than a change in the time allotted to the TAC to adjudicate"
"an appeal. Even if the mischief sought to be remedied was a delay in the"
"appellate  process, 
there 
is 
little  support 
to 
the  contention 
that 
the"
"Legislature intended the said time limit to be mandatory, since it was first"
"extended, and then reduced."
"Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the intention of the Legislature in"
"amending 
the  aforementioned  provision  was  simply 
to  redefine 
time"
"available to the TAC to determine an appeal."
"It  is  also  important  to  note  that  although  the  Legislature  amended  the"
"relevant  provision 
twice, 
it  did  not  specifically  make 
the  deadline"
"mandatory. If the intention of the Legislature was to entitle the Appellant"
"to the relief sought in a situation where the TAC fails to meet the time limit,"
"then the Legislature could have specifically enacted it."
"The learned Counsel for the Appellant cited F.A.R. Bennion in Bennion on"
"Statutory Interpretation4 wherein it is stated that the requirement of an act"
"to be done in a particular manner is merely directory but, that is not the"
"case with a stipulation as to time. If the only time limit which is prescribed"
