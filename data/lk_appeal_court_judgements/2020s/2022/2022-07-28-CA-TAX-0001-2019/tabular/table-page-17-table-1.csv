"Board of Review had not erred in law as regards the time available for it to"
"arrive at its determination. The matter in issue in deciding that particular"
"question of law was whether or not the two-year time limit applicable to"
"the  Board  of  Review  was  to  be  counted  from  the  date  of  receipt  of  the"
"petition of appeal by the Board, or whether it was to be counted from the"
"date  of  commencement  of  the  hearing  of  the  appeal.  That  matter  was"
"decided in favour of the Respondent, with the Court holding the latter to"
"be the case."
"The learned Deputy Solicitor General cited N. S. Bindra25, in analysing the"
"dynamic process of the Court, and asserts that, if a Court, in arriving at a"
"decision  states  that,  “It  would  be  different  or  invalid  if  the  time  period"
"exceeded two years from the date of oral hearing. If that is so it is time"
"barred” is clearly obiter."
"In  the  above  context,  the  final  two  sentences,  “It  would  be  different  or"
"invalid if the time period exceeded 2 years from the date of oral hearing. If"
"that be so it is time barred.”, constitute a conditional observation by Their"
"Lordships. Its nature is hypothetical, and does not reflect the  facts of the"
"case,  as  the  time  period  did  not  exceed  two  years  from  the  date  of  oral"
"hearing.  In  other  words,  if  these  two  sentences  were  taken  out  of  the"
"judgement,  there  would  be  no  change  whatsoever  either  to  the  line  of"
"reasoning in Mohideen, or to the outcome. Therefore, though it was argued"
"by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  that  these  two  sentences  are"
"plainly relevant in deciding the instant case, they do not form part of the"
"ratio in Mohideen."
"I  therefore  consider  that the  hypothetical  conclusion  arrived  at  by  Their"
"Lordships in Mohideen is indeed “unnecessary to the decision in the case”."
"Therefore,  in  keeping  with  the  definition  I  have  provided  above,  and  in"
"agreement  with  Their  Lordships  who  have  pronounced  the  decision  in"
"Kegalle Plantations and Stafford Motors, it is my view that the particular"
"statement in Mohideen (as reproduced and emphasised on above) is indeed"
"obiter dictum."
"The  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  also  commented  in  the  written"
"submissions  on  the  issue  that  the  judgments  in  the  cases  of  Kegalle"
"Plantations and Stafford Motors are not per incuriam, assuming that the"
