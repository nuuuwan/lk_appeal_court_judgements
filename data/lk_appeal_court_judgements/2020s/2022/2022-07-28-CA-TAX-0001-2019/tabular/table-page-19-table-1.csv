"In my view, a determination that the time limit in Section 10 of the TAC"
"Act is mandatory would be inconvenient to the TAC, as delays can occur"
"due  to  various  reasons.  Furthermore,  to  declare  that  the  TAC  is  functus"
"officio upon expiry of the time frame would be unreasonable to both parties"
"for the reasons enunciated above. However, that is not to say that this Court"
"endorses  significant  delays  on 
the  part  of 
the  TAC, 
rather,  merely"
"acknowledges that the construction most agreeable to justice and reason is"
"interpreting that the time frame prescribed in Section 10 of the TAC Act to"
"be  merely  directory.  The  duty  of  this  Court  is  not  to  legislate,  but  to"
"interpret legislation. Legislation is the prerogative of the Legislature. It is"
"therefore the duty of the Legislature to specify what penal consequence or"
"remedy, if any, must follow a lack of substantial compliance by the TAC"
"with the time frame specified in Section 10 of the TAC Act, so that the"
"parties are not inconvenienced."
"Accordingly,  having  given  due  consideration 
to  all  of 
the 
learned"
"Counselâ€™s 
submissions 
on 
this 
question 
of 
law, 
I 
hold 
that 
the"
"determination of the TAC is not time barred."
