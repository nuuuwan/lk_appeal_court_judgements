"In the case of Mohideen v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,12"
"a similar observation was made by His Lordship Gooneratne J. (sitting in"
"the  Court  of  Appeal)  when  examining  the  intention  of  the  Legislature"
"concerning the time limit set for the Board of Review (which was the body"
"that was replaced by the TAC) to reach its determination:"
"“If  it  was  the  intention  of  the  legislature  that  hearing  (sic)  should  be"
"concluded within 2 years from the date of filing the petition or that the time"
"period of 2 years begins to run from the date of filing the petition,  there"
"could not have been a difficulty to make express provision, in that regard"
"(emphasis added).”"
"Based  on  a  review  of  some  tax  legislation  enacted  by  our  Parliament,  I"
"observe that the Legislature, in its wisdom, specifically enacted in Section"
"165 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, as amended, that the"
"failure to acknowledge an appeal within thirty days of its receipt should"
"result  in  the  appeal  being  deemed  to  have  been  received  on  the  day  on"
"which it is delivered to the CGIR. Further, Section 165 (14) of the same"
"Act stated that the failure to determine an appeal within two years from the"
"date of its receipt should result in the appeal being allowed and tax charged"
"accordingly. Similarly, Section 34 (8) of the VAT Act also provided that"
"the failure to determine an appeal within the stipulated period should result"
"in the appeal being allowed and tax charged accordingly."
"Inland  Revenue  Act  No.  24  of  2017,  which  is  in  force  as  at  now,  also"
"provides  for  an  Administrative  Review  of  an  assessment  by  the  CGIR."
"However, unlike in the previous Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, no"
"time frame has been specified in Section 139, for the CGIR to deliver his"
"decision. Nevertheless, Section 140 provides that within thirty days from"
"the date of the decision or upon lapse of ninety days from the request being"
"made  for  an  administrative  review,  the  tax  payer  is  entitled  to  make  an"
"appeal to the TAC. Hence, it becomes clear that while the breach of certain"
"time limits is accompanied by remedies or sanctions, the breach of others"
"is  not.  It  is  important  to  emphasize  that,  Section  144  of  the  2017  Act"
"provides that if the TAC fails either to determine or to respond to an appeal"
