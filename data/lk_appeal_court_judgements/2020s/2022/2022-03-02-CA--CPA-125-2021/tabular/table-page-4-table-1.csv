"counsel  and  cross  examination  had  taken  place  and  the  Counsel"
"appearing now had come late to the case."
"If one may go through section 48 of the Judicature Act pertaining to"
"this matter it says that the accused can “demand that the witnesses"
"be resumoned and reheard.”"
"But 
in  the  section  above 
it  says  that  the 
judge  may  resummon"
"witnesses  “if  he  thinks  fit”.  Therefore  it  clearly  gives  the  judge  the"
"discretion to see whether justice demands that the witnesses should"
"be resummoned."
"At this juncture this Court notes that the prime duty of the judiciary is"
"to safe guard the rights of the people as enshrined by the Constitution"
"chapter  xv  therefore  the  legislature  cannot  impose  a  fetter  on  the"
"discretion of Court , as such  section 48 of the judicature act gives a"
"discretion  to  the  judge  to  decide  whether  recalling  of  witnesses  are"
"needed."
"In  the 
instant  matter  the  petitioner  had  been  represented  by  a"
"counsel 
right 
through  out  and 
the  Counsel  appearing 
for 
the"
"petitioner had come late to the case but nevertheless he had made an"
"application  as  way  back  as  in  2017  but  he  had  failed  to  obtain  an"
"order,  and  thus  had  waited  for  two 
long  years  to  make  another"
"application.  He  claims  that  the  judge  had  given  him  an  undertaking"
"but the said undertaking is not recorded anywhere in the brief."
"As  such  this  Court  sees  no  exceptional  reason  which  shocks  the"
"conscious of this Court to invoke the revisionary powers of this Court."
"As such the instant application for revision is hereby dismissed."
