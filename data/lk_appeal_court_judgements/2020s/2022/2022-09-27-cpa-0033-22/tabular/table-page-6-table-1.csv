"Ranjan Somasinghe Case"
"Ranjan  Somasinghe  Case  (supra)  pivoted  on  the  issue  of  whether  the"
"impugned  order  of  the  High  Court  carried  any  prima  facie  illegality  or"
"irregularity to the extent of exceptionality which warrants the issuance of"
"notice to the respondents named in the revisionary application (similar to"
"the instant case  before us). Hence, this Court focused on the impugned"
"judgment in Ranjan Somasinghe whereby it was held that the following"
"extracts  of  the  order  of  the  High  Court  of  Colombo  dated  10.06.2020"
"delivered in Case No. HC 20/17 was neither contrary to law nor irregular"
"to the point of exceptionality:"
