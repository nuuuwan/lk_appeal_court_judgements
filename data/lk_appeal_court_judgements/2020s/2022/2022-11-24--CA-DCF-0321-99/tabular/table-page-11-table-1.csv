"decision  does  not  prevent  the  Court  from  deciding  the  same  question  arising"
"between the same parties in a subsequent suit according to law.”"
"T
he decision in Katiritamby’s case was followed by the Supreme Court in the case"
"of Subramaniam Vs. Kumaraswami 57 NLR 130 in which case it was held that an"
"erroneous decision on a pure question of law will operate as res judicata in regard"
"only to the subject matter of the suit in which it is given. It does not prevent the"
"Court  from  subsequently  deciding  the  same  question  correctly  in  another  suit"
"between  the  same  parties  when  the  subject  matter  of  the  suit 
is  different."
"Therefore,  assuming  that  the  consent  decree 
in  the  earlier  case  based  on  a"
"settlement entered between the parties on a mistaken belief of a question of law"
"and which is contrary to law, contains a decision of Court it cannot operate as res"
"judicata  as  far  as  the  devolution  of  the  rights  of  Abanchiya  and  Podina  are"
"concerned and it does not prevent the District Court from subsequently deciding"
"the same question correctly in another suit between the same parties."
"I
n cross examination it has been suggested to the 5th Defendant that the plaintiff"
"who  claims  her  title  through  Podina  who  has  no  title  according  to  the  earlier"
"settlement had possessed her rights in the corpus and the 5th Defendant had not"
"denied that suggestion. Plaintiff’s husband who testified on behalf of the Plaintiff"
"had stated that the 5th Defendant Sirineris and Jayadewa cultivated this paddy field"
"and gave the Plaintiff her share. The 12th Defendant who is the son of Jemma who"
"had purchased rights from Podina after the settlement stated in evidence that the"
"5th  Defendant  Sirineris  cultivated  the  land  and  gave  a  share  of  the  produce  to"
"Jemma.  Later  Sirineris  gave  this  share  to Jemma’s  children.  The  evidence  of  the"
"Plaintiff’s husband and the 12th Defendant regarding Sirineris giving a share to them"
"were not taken in cross examination and therefore that evidence can be believed."
"That shows  that the parties  to the earlier  settlement had not acted upon it and"
"those who had purchased rights from Podina had possessed the corpus without"
"any objections from Podiya’s heirs. The contents of the deed marked පැ7 show that"
"Podina had transferred her rights in three lands to Wijehamy on that deed. In that"
"deed Podina had referred to the fact that she derived her title to those three lands"
"on the deed number 16967 marked පැ2.  In terms of the settlement marked 5V5"
"Podina had consented to confine her rights only to one land called Alawalagewatta"
"and she had agreed to give up the rights in the other lands she had purchased on"
"11"
