"delivery  back  to  the  person  from  whose  possession  the  property  was"
"seized.‚Äù"
"Therefore, 
it 
is  apparent 
that  Section  431  of 
the  Code  of  Criminal"
"Procedure Act is not a provision that confers the jurisdiction on the court"
"to  decide  disputed  claims  to  possession,  but  bears  the  objective  of"
"providing for the Magistrate to be promptly brought in to official touch with"
"the property seized by the Police."
"And as per the dictum in Silva and Another v. Officer-in-Charge, Police"
"Station, Tambuttegama (1991) 2 SLR 83, there is a degree of discretion"
"vested in the Magistrate by section 431 of the Code (cited above) in that it"
"provides for the Magistrate to make an order as he thinks fit regarding the"
"delivery of an impugned property. Therefore, in exercising this discretion,"
"it is pertinent to determine whether the leaned Magistrate has considered"
"all the relevant factors and provided reasons for the decision. The learned"
"Magistrate has noted in his order that the petitioner has only taken steps"
"to make a police complaint  five months  after the transaction to transfer"
"the ownership to the second respondent, and by that time the ownership"
"has passed on to several people.  It  is also noted  that all the documents"
"pertaining to the vehicle, namely, its registration, insurance documents,"
"revenue license, signed MTA6 Form etc. have all been handed over to the"
"second respondent, who claims that the transaction took place amicably."
"These documents have thereafter been ultimately handed over to the first"
"respondent when he bought the impugned vehicle. The learned Magistrate"
"has also considered that the police investigations have not revealed that"
"the said vehicle has been utilized in any illegal activity, nor that the vehicle"
"was  transferred  from  the  petitioner  to  the  second  respondent  through"
"coercion  or  force,  but  amicably.  Based  on  such  reasons  the  learned"
"Magistrate  has  deliberated  on 
releasing 
the  vehicle 
to 
the  second"
"respondent."
