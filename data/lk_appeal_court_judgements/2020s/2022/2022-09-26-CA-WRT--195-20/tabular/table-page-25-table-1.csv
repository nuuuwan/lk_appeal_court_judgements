"requirements of natural justice. That advice was right. This was not a"
"suspension of an administrative character: it was a suspension more"
"in the nature of a punishment. (page 20 of the judgment)"
"Therefore,   Denning   L.   J.   has   decided   that   the   suspension   in"
"question   in   that   case   was   a   punishment.   Hence   what   was   said   in"
"reference to suspensions that were not punishments was in obiter."
"Geoffrey Lane J., went even further and said,"
"“The National Executive Committee, acting on legal advice, decided in"
"effect  that they would not suspend and there is no evidence of any"
"danger or of any suspicion that that decision may be reversed. Since"
"that is so, there is no need to decide whether there was any power to"
"suspend the plaintiffs nor to decide the applicability or otherwise of"
"the rules of natural justice.” (page 26 of the judgment)"
"Hence   that   case   can   be   even   categorized   under   a   judgment   in"
"which the question of the applicability of the rules of natural justice"
"never arose."
"Therefore, whereas Denning L. J., said the suspension in question"
"was a  punishment Geoffery  Lane  J., said  the applicability of  rules of"
"natural   justice   does   not   arise   hence   what   the   respondent’s   cite   as"
"favourable to them was clearly said in obiter."
"Furthermore Denning L.J., commencing his speech, in his customary"
"short   sentences   of   precise   meaning   said,   “This   is   an   urgent   case.   So   we"
"must proceed to give judgment at once”. (page 02 of the judgment) Therefore"
"admittedly, to observe with respect, the questions have not been considered"
"in great depth."
"Denning  L.J., had referred to John vs. Rees (1968) in the aforesaid"
"case. It is pertinent to note what Megarry J., said in that case. One of the"
"questions   considered   in   that   case   was   the   applicability   of   the   rule,   audi"
"alteram partem. Although it was considered in regard to “expulsion” and"
"“ipso facto cessation of membership”, it applies in equal force to the"
