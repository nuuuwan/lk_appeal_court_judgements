"persons concerned before ordering a suspension of a local party such"
"as here, then there is a real dispute because, of course, the National"
"Executive   Committee   says   it   is   quite   impracticable   to   do   so.     They"
"have to hold an inquiry to get at the facts first, and it is reasonable to"
"suspend all concerned pending such an enquiry."
"In the case of Paul Walls Furnell Vs. Whangarei High Schools Board"
"(1973) Appeal Cases 660, it was said at page 679 by Lord Norris: “it"
"has often been pointed out that the conceptions which are indicated"
"when   natural   justice   is   invoked   or   referred   to   are   not   comprised"
"within and are not to be confined within certain hard and fast and"
"rigid rules: see the speeches in Wiseman vs. Borneman (1971) A.XC."
"297.  Natural justice is but fairness,  writ large and juridically.  It"
"has  been   described   as  ‘fair  play   in  action’.   Nor   it   is   a  leaven   to  be"
"associated only with judicial or quasi-judicial occasions. But as was"
"pointed out by Tucker  L.J. in Russel vs. Duke of Norfolk (1949) All"
"E.R. 109, 118, the requirements of natural justice must depend on the"
"circumstances of each particular case and the subject matter under"
"consideration.” (page 24 and 25 of the judgment)"
