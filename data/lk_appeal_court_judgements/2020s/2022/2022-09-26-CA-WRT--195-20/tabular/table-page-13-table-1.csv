"affected to make any relevant  statement, or to correct  or controvert"
"any relevant statement brought forward to his prejudice. For instance,"
"a decision may have to be given on an emergency, when promptitude"
"is of great importance; or there might be obstructive conduct on the"
"part of the person affected.  Their Lordships, however, do not find"
"any   suggestion   of   such   conditions   in   the   case   under   appeal."
"Moreover,   in   this   case   the   Supreme   Court,   on   the   evidence   before"
"them, has found that the Acting Governor did give the appellant a fair"
"opportunity   of   being   heard   and   of   meeting   statements   made   to   his"
"prejudice, and, for reasons given later, their Lordships fully concur in"
"this finding.”"
"The words “their Lordships, however, do not find any suggestion"
