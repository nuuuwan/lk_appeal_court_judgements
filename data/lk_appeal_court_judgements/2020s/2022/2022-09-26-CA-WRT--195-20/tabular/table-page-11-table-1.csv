"Therefore,   the   Court   of   Appeal   considered   what   it   called   “a   great"
"public  urgency”.  As Lord Diplock  said in  Kodeeswaran  vs.  the  Attorney"
"General   (1969)  with   regard   to   the   Proclamation   of   1799   A.D,   that  the"
"language   used   must   be   understood   in   the   circumstances   of   the"
"particular era, the term “Great public urgency” should also be understood"
"in the circumstances that prevailed in this country in 1982 where the then"
"Government took steps to complete a project in an accelerated way."
"The   respondent   in   the   present   case   also   says   that   there   was   an"
"urgency in this matter too, to prevent the “contaminated” teas from reaching"
"the international market. However according to the narration of facts by the"
"respondents themselves, the samples of teas were obtained on 08.06.2020,"
"the report has come on 24.06.2020, and the Petitioner was suspended with"
"effect from 30.06.2020.  What happened from 24.06.2020 to 30.06.2020"
"is not explained,  while the more significant question is that if there had"
"been such an emergency of stopping the “contaminated” teas from reaching"
"the international market, it appears that the suspension should have been"
"done on 24.06.2020 itself, without waiting for 6 days. The petitioner could"
"have been informed on 24th  itself  or at least on the 25th  that its teas are"
"contaminated,  thus giving an opportunity for  the petitioner to explain, as"
"the first respondent had taken 6 days to suspend the petitioner."
"The respondents in paragraph 85 of the aforesaid written submissions"
"refer to the case of De Verteuil vs. Knaggs [1918] UKPC 29."
"A part of this case was cited by L.H. De Alwis J. at page 614 which"
"said, “In De Verteuil vs. Knaggs, (4) their Lordships of the Privy Council said"
"""The particular form of inquiry must depend on the conditions under which"
"the   discretion   is   exercised   in   any   particular   case,   and   no   general   rule"
"applicable to all conditions can be formulated. It must, however, be borne in"
"mind   that   there   may   be   special   circumstances   which   would   justify   a"
"Governor,   acting   in   good   faith,   to   take   action   even   if   he   did   not   give   an"
