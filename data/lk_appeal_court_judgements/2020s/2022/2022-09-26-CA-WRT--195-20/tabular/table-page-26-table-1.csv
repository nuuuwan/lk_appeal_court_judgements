"difference   between   “suspension”   and   “cancellation”   in   the   present"
"It was said,"
"“In   the   present   case,   there   has   not   in   terms   been   any   process   of"
"expulsion.   Instead,   there   has   been   the   process   which,   on   Mr."
"Sparrow's argument, resulted in what for brevity may be described as"
"an   ipso   facto   cessation   of   membership   which,   he   contended,   ""got"
"round all problems relating to expulsion."" Considered from the point"
"of   view   of   the   members,   however,   the   practical   result   is"
"indistinguishable from expulsion. Before, they were members; after,"
"they   had  been   deprived   of  their   membership   against   their   will.  The"
"precise   legal   description   of   the   process   by   which   this   occurred,"
"whether by destruction of their own membership, or acts constituting"
"resignation, or repudiation of membership, may well be a matter  of"
"indifference to them: they have been unwillingly evicted”."
"“I   cannot   believe   that   the   principles   of   natural   justice   can   be"
"ousted by the simple process of describing expulsion by another"
"name,   or   resting   it   upon   an   alternative   theoretical   basis."
"Membership   of   a   club   or   association   is   doubtless   founded   upon   a"
"basis   of   contract;   but   in   many   cases   it   is   not   merely   a   contract."
"Membership often gives the member  valuable proprietary and social"
"rights,   and   these,   as   well   as   the   contract,   would   be   terminated   by"
"expulsion.   There   is   thus   involved   in   expulsion   not   merely   the"
"termination of the contract but also the forfeiture of these other rights;"
"and   however   ready   the   law   may   be   to   recognise   the   discharge   of   a"
"contract by repudiation, it is far less ready to accept that there has"
"been   a   forfeiture   of   these   other   rights,   whether   the   process   is"
"described as ""ipso facto determination"" or otherwise”."
