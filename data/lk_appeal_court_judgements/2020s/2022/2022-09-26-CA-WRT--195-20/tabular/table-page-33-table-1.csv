"02.07.2020  (i.e.,  after  the  suspension)   the allegations  were  explained  and"
"they were asked to show cause."
"It is also submitted, that, the directors did not seek further time to show"
"cause and no such cause was shown."
"Then, it is said, that directors did not deny that sucrose was found in tea"
"and   even   conceded   “that   it   may   have   been   possible   that   the   tea   was"
"adulterated   without   their   knowledge”.   They   had   even   said   that   they"
"suspect that an employee who was dismissed could have been instrumental"
"in doing so."
"So, the directors have denied liability. They had given a possible reason too."
"Whether it be true or not, these are the things that they could have said, if"
"they  were given  an  opportunity of  controverting  the  findings,  prior  to the"
"suspension."
"It is said that they have conceded that a large amount of sucrose could have"
"been brought in without their knowledge. “Sucrose”, is “a compound which"
"is the chief component of cane or beet sugar1”.  Actually, “sucrose”, is"
"synonymous to “sugar”. “Sugar” is not contraband. Cannot a person take"
"“sugar” into a Tea Factory?"
"Then,   it   is   submitted,   that   the   directors   have   not   raised   any   complaint"
"regarding the testing process or sample process. Why should they complain"
"against testing? The objection regarding the sample process is futile after"
"the suspension."
"It is submitted, that, the directors did not deny that it was tea from their"
"factory? This too, after the suspension, is a futile objection. Likewise, the"
"directors seeking clemency, if ever they did so, is not a matter which vitiates"
"the need to hear them before suspension."
"Then,   it   is   submitted,   with   regard   to   a   previous   occasion   in   which   the"
"registration of the petitioner was suspended and given a case number  by"
