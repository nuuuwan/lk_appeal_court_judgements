"speed as practicable in the investigation”."
"The   American   company   Leasco   made   a   takeover   bid,   which   they"
"subsequently   withdrew.   The   price   of   the   shares   slumped.   Dealings   were"
"suspended.   The   Board   of   Trade   ordered   an   investigation.   Two   inspectors"

"“A little later the Inspectors called on the Directors to give evidence."
"Each of them refused. Typical was the attitude of Mr. Robert Maxwell"
"himself. He came with his Solicitor, Mr. Freeman, to the place where"
"the Inspectors were meeting. He gave his name and address and said"
"that   he   was   the   holder   of   the   Military   Cross   and   a   Member   of"
"Parliament.   Then   Mr.   Stable,   a   Queen’s   Counsel,   one   of   the"
