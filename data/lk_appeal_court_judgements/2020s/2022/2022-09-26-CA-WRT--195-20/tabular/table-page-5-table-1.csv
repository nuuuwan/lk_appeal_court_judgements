"respondent  where  an oral  hearing  took  place  and  the  said directors  have"
"signed   the   proceedings   of   the   said   hearing   which   is   marked   R7.   The"
"aforesaid is the narration of facts as done from paragraphs 6 to 26 of the"
"respondents written submissions dated 02.08.2022 filed in this court."
"One of the main allegations of the petitioner is that before the said"
"suspension   of   the   license   was   made,   the   petitioner   was   not   heard   and"
"therefore there is a breach of the rules of natural justice."
"The   first   respondent   took   up   several   positions   in   reply   to   the   said"
"allegation, which are (i) that the suspension was only a temporary measure"
"prior  to a formal inquiry being  held and hence  there was no necessity  to"
"hear the petitioner, (ii) in certain circumstances a test or examination will be"
"a sufficient substitute for an oral hearing, (iii) the suspension of license was"
"the only mechanism to prevent contaminated tea from being sold under the"
"brand   of  “Ceylon  Tea”   and,  (iv)   that  since   urgent   measures   or  immediate"
"steps should have been taken to prevent contaminated tea from going into"
"international   market   thus   harming   the   reputation   for   “Ceylon   Tea”"
"suspension of the license had to be done before the petitioner was heard."
"On 03.06.2022, when this matter was argued, the Court decided to"
"hear parties on the preliminary question of the applicability of section 8(2),"
"in that, whether the petitioner should have been given notice and thus"
"given an opportunity of being heard prior to the suspension or whether"
"the   suspension   was   an   order   which   the   first   respondent   could   have"
"made ex parte, since it appeared to the Court that the decision of the case"
"will   depend   on   the   answer   to   the   said   question.   When   the   Court   invited"
"parties to tender written submissions on this question, the learned ASG for"
"the respondents indicated that he will file written submissions on the entire"
"case.   The   Court   then   allowed   parties   to   file   written   submissions   on   the"
"entire matter, if they so desire. The petitioner has filed written submissions"
"only on the said preliminary question. It appears that the respondents have"
"filed written submissions on the entire case."
"5 | Writ 195 2020 – Judgment: Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice B. Sasi Mahendran."
