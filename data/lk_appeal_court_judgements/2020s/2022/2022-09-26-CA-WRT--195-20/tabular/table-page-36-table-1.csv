"APPEAL"
"B. Sasi Mahendran, J."
"I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgment of my brother"
"Justice D.N. Samarakoon and I am in entire agreement with the conclusion"
"he has reached. The importance of the issue in contention i.e., the concept"
"of   ‘natural   justice’,   its   applicability   or   lack   thereof,   in   the   present   case"
"compels me to express my views on the matter, albeit in brief."
"Section  8(2)(a) of  the Tea  Control Act  No.  51  of 1957,  as amended,"
"provides   that   where   the   Tea   Controller   (or   the   “Tea   Commissioner”)   is"
"satisfied, after such inquiry as he may deem necessary that the building,"
"equipment, or manner of operation of any tea factory is not of a standard"
"conducive to the manufacture of made tea of good quality the Controller may"
"suspend or cancel where necessary the registration of such tea factory. The"
"underlying   issue   is   whether   the   Controller   is   empowered   to   suspend   the"
"registration   of   the   Petitioner   factory   without   offering   a   fair   hearing   in"

"the   Petitioner   factory’s   sample   tea   obtained   from   the   Petitioner   factory’s"
"registered   selling   broker   was   adulterated.   The   fact   that   registration   was"
"suspended   was   informed   to   the   management   of   the   Petitioner   factory"
"informally through its Brokers. The suspension was informed to the Brokers"
"by   the   document   marked   “P2”   dated   30th  June   2020,   which   was   not"
"addressed/ copied to the Petitioner factory. On the 1st of July 2020, officers"
"of the 1st  Respondent  visited  the factory  and wrote on the Tea  Book  that"
"production is discontinued. This was six days after the report was released."
"The Respondents argue that the consideration that ought to be given"
"much weight is that of the recognition of ‘Ceylon Tea’ around the world and"
