"respectfully   concur:   in   essence   suspension   is   merely   expulsion"
"pro tanto. Each is penal, and each deprives the member concerned of"
"the enjoyment of his rights of membership or office.  Accordingly, in"
"my judgment the rules of natural justice prima facie apply to any"
"process   of   suspension   in   the   same   way   that   they   apply   to"
"expulsion. Lord Denning in Lewis v. Heffer (5), having quoted the last"
"few lines above said: ""Those words apply, no doubt, to suspensions"
"which   are   inflicted   by   way   of   punishment,   as   for   instance   when   a"
"member   of   the   Bar   is   suspended   from   practice   for   six   months,   or"
"when a solicitor is suspended from practice. But they do not apply to"
"suspensions   which   are   made,   as   a   holding   operation,   pending"
"enquires.   Very   often   irregularities   are   disclosed   in   a   government"
"department or in a business house; and a man may be suspended on"
"full pay pending inquiries. Suspicion may rest on him; and so he is"
"suspended until he is cleared of it. No one, so far as I know, has ever"
"questioned such a suspension on the ground that it could not be done"
"unless   he   is   given   notice   of   the   charge   and   an   opportunity   of"
"defending   himself,   and   so   forth.   The   suspension   in   such   a   case   is"
"merely done by way of good administration. A situation has arisen in"
"which something must be done at once. The work of the department of"
"the office is being affected by rumours and suspicions. The others will"
"not trust the man. In order to get back to proper work, the man is"
"suspended. At that stage the rules of natural justice do not apply"":"
"See Furnell v. Whangarei High Schools Board (6). Geoffrey Lane LJ. in"
"the course of the same judgment at page 360 said; ""So far as the rules"
"of natural justice are concerned, it is suggested that before the NEC"
"suspended the committees and officers they should have been heard,"
"and the fact that they were not heard was a breach of the rules of"
"natural justice sufficient to invalidate the suspension. It seems to me"
"that this suspension was an administrative action by which by its very"
"nature had to be taken immediately. It was impossible for the NEC at"
"that stage, and I emphasise those words 'at that stage', to hear both"
