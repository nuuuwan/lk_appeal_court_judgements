"Coming   back  to  Faleel   vs.   Susil   Moonesinghe   and   others   (1992),"
"there was another reason for A. Ismail J., to conclude that prior notice of"
"suspension was not necessary. The judgment of the Court of Appeal said at"
"page 314-315,"
"“A further ground of challenge was that the order of suspension was"
"made without a hearing or any prior notice and that the said order"
"was   grossly   unreasonable,   as   there   was   no   situation   of   emergency"
"which   warranted   an   immediate   order   of   suspension   and   that   no"
"countervailing consideration or circumstances existed which required"
"an order of suspension as a holding operation."
"Section 2(3) (a) of Statute No. 4 of 1991 provides as follows:"
"""(a) Before appointing a retired Judicial Officer under sub section"
"(2) to inquire into any matter the Minister may  without hearing"
"or other formality as a holding operation, pending the proposed"
"inquiry and report by such officer preliminarily"
"(1) suspend   the   Chief   Executive   Officer   of   the   Local"
"Authority from office  and direct the Deputy Mayor or Vice"
"Chairman of  the  Local  Authority  as the case  may  be  ...  to"
"exercise   the   powers   and   perform   the   duties   of   the   Chief"
"Executive Officer;"""
"Hence the relevant section granted the power to suspend, the Chief"
"Executive   Officer   (Chairman)   “without   hearing   or   other   formality   as   a"
"holding operation’, prior to the appointment of a retired Judicial Officer to"
"inquire into the allegations."
"There is no similar power granted to the Controller of Tea by section"
"8(2) of the Sri Lanka Tea Control Act."
"(B) The allegation of approbation and reprobation:"
"It is submitted by the respondent at paragraph 28 et. seq., of the aforesaid"
"written   submissions,   that   the   petitioner’s   directors   were   summoned   on"
"32 | Writ 195 2020 – Judgment: Justice Dushmanta N. Samarakoon & Justice B. Sasi Mahendran."
