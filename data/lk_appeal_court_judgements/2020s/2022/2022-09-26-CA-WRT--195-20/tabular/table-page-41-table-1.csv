"‘What then are the requirements of natural justice in a case of this kind?"
"First,   I   think   that   the   person   accused   should   know   the   nature   of   the"
"accusation made; secondly, that he should be given an opportunity to state"
"his case; and, thirdly, of course, that the tribunal should act in good faith. I"
"do not myself think that there really is anything more.’”"
