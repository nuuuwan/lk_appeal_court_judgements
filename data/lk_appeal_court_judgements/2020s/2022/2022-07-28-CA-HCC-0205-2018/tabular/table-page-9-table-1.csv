"The next two arguments are that the evidence of PW1 should not be relied on."
"Counsel for the appellant argues that the prosecution has not proved the age of"
"the  deceased.  As  PW1  was  the  legal  wife  of  the  appellant,  her  evidence  is  not"
"admissible  against  the  appellant  unless  the  age  of  the  deceased,  which  was"
"proved by the prosecution, was below sixteen years as per the provisions of the"
"Children  and  Young  Persons  Ordinance.  Further,the  Counsel  argues  that  she"
"waited for ten days to divulge the incident to anyone, and her evidence should"
"not be relied upon because of this delay. Further, he argues that PW1 had an"
"affair  with  another,  and  as  such,  she  was  prone  to  give  evidence  against  the"
"appellant."
"Before considering these contentions, I would draw attention  to the answer to"
"allocutus at the conclusion of the trial. The appellant stated that the wife (PW1)"
"had an illicit affair with another, and on the fateful day when he returned home"
"from work, he felt that somebody was with his wife. The door of the house was"
"closed. He took the knife and pushed the door. He saw Prem and his wife, and"
"Prem  was  on  top  of  her.  He  threw  the  knife  at  them.  Unfortunately,  it  struck"
"the deceased child, and she died."
"In the case of  Periambalam vs The Queen, 74 NLR 515, the Court of Criminal"
"Appeal  held  that;  an  admission  made  by  an  accused  person  in  answer  to"
"allocutus  is  a  part  of  the  evidence  in  the  case,  and  the  Court  of  Criminal"
"Appeal cannot ignore the effect of such admission. The appellant has admitted"
"that  the  deceased  died  of  an  injury  caused  by  him.  He  claims  that  it  was  an"
"accident."
"The  allegation  that  the  evidence  of  PW1  is  not  credible,  should  be  considered"
"with the above admission of the appellant."
