"upon exceptional circumstances. The term exceptional has not been defined"
"in  the  statue.    But  in  the  cases  so  far  decided  it  has  been  concluded  that"
"exceptionality differs from case to case."
"The learned President’s Counsel contended that the suspect being in remand"
"since 2020 without trial or indictment against him is violating the right to his"
"personal liberty and contended further that the main item of evidence against"
"the  suspect  is  a  section  27  recovery  under  the  Evidence  Ordinance  which  he"
"said was not sufficient to prove his guilt."
"At this point this Court is not inclined to go into the merits of the case but, we"
"observe that he has been first taken into custody under the provisions of the"
"Prevention of Terrorism Act and later produced under the instant Act.  But, up"
"to  date  the  Law  enforcement  authorities  have  failed  to  take  any  meaningful"
"action against the suspect."
"The  state  Counsel  appearing  for  the  Respondent  have  failed  to  state  as  to"
"when or whether indictment would be forwarded against the suspect or not."
"It  has  been  held  in  the  case  of  Attorney  General  is  Ediriweera  (supra)    that"
"“delay  is  always  a  relative  term  and  the  question  to  be  considered  is  not"
"whether  there  was  mere  explicable  delay,  but  whether  there  has  been"
"excessive  or  oppressive  delay  and  this  always  depends  on  the  facts  of  the"
"circumstances of the case…..”"
"The  State  Counsel  has  urged  that  the  quantity  of  the  substance  taken  into"
"custody from the suspect is commercial in nature."
