"is no such mention or instigation of the condition of the case and the involvement of  such"
"Police  Constable,  nor  was  there  any  reference  to  the  High  Court  case  from  which  this"
"concoction  for  revenge  stemmed  from  or  the  placing  of  such  position  to  any  of  the"
"prosecution's witnesses."
"It was the contention of the learned President’s Counsel for the accused-appellant that the"
"raid  conducted  by  the  police  in  arresting  the  accused  was  not  a  genuine  incident.  It  was"
"testified by PW 1, that they travelled from the station to Panama by stopping a private van"
"which was travelling and it was further revealed that details of the van that they travelled in"
"were not remembered including the colour of the van. It was also testified that after the arrest"
"that the accused along with the cannabis was taken to one Cader's shop for the purpose of"
"weighing the parcels that were allegedly found in the possession of the accused-appellant"
"containing cannabis. The statement of the PW 1 marked A 1 which was the statement given"
"at the disciplinary inquiry that was carried out subsequent to the arrest of the accused stated"
"that they travelled in motorbikes to conduct the raid and when the proposition was made to"
"PW  1  in  cross-examination,  he  admitted  it  to  the  effect  that  if  he  had  mentioned  it  in  his"
"statement that it is true."
"The Learned Trial Judge erred in law by his failure to evaluate and analyse the evidence as it"
"was  and  by  imposing  the  burden  on  the  accused  stating  in  his  judgment  that,  ""  If  such"

"according  to  the  rules  of  evidence  during  the  course  of  the  trial,""  while  disregarding  the"
"cardinal principle that the prosecution must not derive from the weakness of the defence. It"
"was argued on behalf of the appellant that the said vital contradiction that directly attacks"
"the credibility of the main witness has caused severe prejudice to the accused-appellant."
"Further, it was suggested by the appellant that the accused was taken to ""Carder's Shop"" for"
"the purposes of weighing the Cannabis, no corroborative evidence was brought before the"
"learned Trial Judge, when PW 1 testified, and the prosecution made application to mark a"

"The defence raised an objection in marking this document as it was contrary to the provisions"
"of section 67 of the Evidence Ordinance, court permitted the prosecution to mark the said"
"document subject to proof. The prosecution failed to provide the required proof and failed to"
