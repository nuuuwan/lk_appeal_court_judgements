"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  accused-appellant  argued  that  the  prosecution's"
"failure to call vital witnesses has created doubt about the incident. The officer by the name"
"of Mohideen who has cordial ties with the above-mentioned drug peddler from Pothuvil was"
"part of the raid where the accused was arrested although Mohideen was listed as a witness"
"by the prosecution, he was not called upon to give evidence."
"It was the main contention of the  appellant that  this case was fabricated against  him and"
"there were police officers namely Mohideen and Sugathananda who were involved in such"
"fabrication and were also part of the raid as  brought out in evidence.  Learned President’s"
"Counsel  submitted  that  in  cross-examination  of  PW  1,  it  was  clear  that  the  witnesses  are"
"concealing the truth and are narrating a version consistent with his testimony. In the present"
"context,  it  was  the  duty  of  the  prosecution  to  bring  forward  these  witnesses  in  order  to"
"counter the position of the appellant. However, the prosecution has failed to do so raising a"
"strong  presumption  under  section  114  (f)  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  that  if  the  witnesses"
"were produced it would have been in favour of the accused-appellant."
"It was argued by the learned President’s Counsel for the respondent that under section 134"
"of the Evidence Ordinance No.14 of 1895, there is no particular number of witnesses required"
"for  the  proving  of  any  fact.  Moreover,  in  the  case  of  Devunderage  Nihal  vs.  The  Attorney"
"General  SC  Appeal  154/2010,  the  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  for  the  respondent"
"further argued that it is up to the person against whom the charge is levelled to formulate his"
"or her defence."
"The  system  of  administration  of  justice  gives  such  a  person  the  freedom  to  testify,  to  call"
"witnesses to testify on his behalf or even the freedom to make an application to the court, in"
"the  interests  of  justice,  to  summon  a  prosecution  witness  that  had  not  been  called,  as  a"
"witness  of  court,  in  terms  of  section  439  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure.  The  accused"
"person  gets  an  opportunity  to  cross-examine  such  a  witness.  In  the  present  case,  the"
"witnesses called upon by the prosecution included PW 1, the Chief Investigating Officer, the"
"second officer who accompanied and got involved in the raid PW 2, the officers who took"
"over  the  productions  at  the  Reserve  Service  of  the  Police  Station  PW  3  and  PW  7,  the"
"Government Analyst PW 9 and another one of the accompanying officers PW 4."
"The 5th and 6th  witnesses were not called to give evidence, moreover,  the 5th witness was"
"released on order of the  court as such evidence was deemed unnecessary. Thereafter, on"
"06.07.2015 when questioned by the court as to who is the most important witness out of the"
"four put forward, the Defence Counsel informed the court that it was PW 1 that should be"
"recalled.  Therefore,  on  such  considerations,  it  can  be  deduced  that  PC  Mohideen  was  not"
"called upon by the prosecution as he was not involved in the actual recovery of the contents,"
"but merely a supporting officer."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the respondent submitted that the evidence given by PW"
"1, was corroborated by PW 2 and PW 4 gave no rise to the need for further corroboration on"
"part of the prosecution's case put forward. As mentioned above, the defence if it was deemed"
"so vital for the case should have raised section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in order"
"to call on PC Mohideen as a witness. By not following such procedure they waive the right to"
"deem such a witness as significant and use such as a ground to appeal. Furthermore, the High"
"Court Judge holds that although the appellant in his sworn evidence states this relationship"
