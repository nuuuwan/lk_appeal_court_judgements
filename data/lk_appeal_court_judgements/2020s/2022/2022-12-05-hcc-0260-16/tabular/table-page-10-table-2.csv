"","“One thing is clear not so much as a rule of law but rather as a working rule"
"","of common sense. A trial judge has, except on rare occasions, a very great"
"","advantage over an appellate court; evidence of a witness  heard and seen"
"","has a very great advantage over a transcript of that evidence; and a Court"
"of  Appeal  should  never","interfere  unless 
it 
is  satisfied  both 
that 
the"
"","judgement ought not to stand and that the divergence of view between the"
"trial","judge  and  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  not  been  occasioned  by  any"
"","demeanor of the witnesses or truer atmosphere of the trial (which may have"
"","eluded the appellate court) or any other of those advantages which the trial"
"judge possesses.”",""
