"A
fter  supporting  the  application  by  the  Respondent,  Court  issued  notice  on  the  Appellant."
"Thereafter, both parties filed their respective affidavits and counter affidavits. After the conclusion"
"of the inquiry, the learned Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge delivered the Order on"
"08.01.2016 deciding that the Respondent was entitled to the roadway in dispute and ordered to"
"remove all obstructions to the respondent’s access."
"B
eing  aggrieved  by  the  said  Order  of  the  Primary  Court  Judge,  the  Respondent-Petitioner-"
"Appellant  invoked  the  revisionary  jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court  of  Kegalle  to  revise  the  said"
"Order. However, after making oral submissions and tendering written submissions by both parties,"
"the learned High Court Judge dismissed the application of the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant by"
"Order dated 23.11.2017."
"A
dmittedly, the Appellant and the Respondent are co-owners to the premises in dispute and the"
"Appellant had instituted a partition action bearing No. 28904/P in the District Court of Kegalle"
"making the Respondent as a Defendant."
"A
s  such,  it  was  submitted  by  the  Respondent  that  since  the  Respondent  is  a  co-owner  to  the"
"premises in dispute thus she is entitled to an undivided portion of land including soil rights to the"
"disputed roadway."
"H
ence, the Appellant has no right to obstruct the Respondent’s right of way which was used in"
"common by both of them."
"T
he Appellant has constructed a gate at the entry to the roadway promising to handover a key to"
"the Respondent. When the Appellant failed to do so, the dispute arose effectively shutting out the"
"Respondent from entering the portion of land occupied by the Respondent."
"A
pparently, the Appellant had taken up a different position that the disputed roadway is a private"
"roadway acquired by the Appellant and his predecessors through an adjoining land for their own"
"private use."
