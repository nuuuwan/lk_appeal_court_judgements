"The 2nd Respondent further contends that the application has to fail as it is misconceived in law"
"and  is  futile.  The  1st  Respondent  additionally,  has  raised  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  name"
"necessary parties to this application and also has failed to come with clean hands. This Court will"
"deal with these objections at a later stage."
"It is common ground that the Petitioner had been informed of an inquiry under section 90 of the"
"Agrarian  Development  Act,  and  both  parties  had  been  present  and  had  made  their  respective"
"submissions and tendered supporting documents at the said inquiry."
"In  the  caption  of  the  petition,  the  Petitioner  has  pleaded  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  against  the  1st"
"Respondent. In the body of the petition too, the Petitioner pleads to quash the intended order P5"
"for the reasons stated therein. However, without any reasons pleaded in the body, in the prayer,"
"the Petitioner has pleaded not only for a writ of certiorari but also for a writ of mandamus against"
"the 1st and 3rd Respondents."
