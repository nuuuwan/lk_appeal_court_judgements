"Mediation Board. This buttresses the 2nd Respondent’s submission that the Petitioner by unlawful"
"acts, had interfered with his cultivation rights and that he had to make a complaint to the police"
"against the Petitioner which has now resulted in a Magistrates Court proceeding."
"At this stage, the Court will advert to the impugned order reflected in P5. The said order dated,"
"11.10.2017 (P5) is against the Petitioner and another S. H. Jagath Chandana. The said order reads"
"as follows,"
"“…..නැමැති  අක්කර  04ක  කුඹුරු  ඉඩමේ  නීත්‍යානුකූල   අදම ාවියා  වූ  අේබලනමත්‍ාට,"

"When we consider this order, the Court is  mindful of the  fact that the inquiring officer  is  not a"
"person  who  is  conversed  with  the  law  of  evidence  and  is  not  an  attorney-at-law,  in  fact  in  this"
"instance, it was the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development who has been called under"
"section 90 to ascertain whether any person has interfered or was attempting to interfere with the"
"cultivation rights of the owner cultivator or occupier."
"It was common ground that this whole inquiry commenced with the 2nd Respondent submitting a"
"complaint  under  section  90  complaining  that  his  cultivation  rights  are  being  violated  by  the"
"Petitioner. The inquiring officer under this section had to inquire whether there is interference and"
"whether that interference will result in damage or loss  of crop or livestock and he is required to"
"give  an  order  for the  protection  of  the  cultivation  rights.  We  find  that the  said  order  in  P5  has"
"addressed  this  requirement.  As  this  is  a  writ  application,  this  Court  is  not there to  consider  the"
"legality of the order. In our view, the order comprises of required reasons and  is  in compliance"
"with section 90 of Act no. 46 of 2000."
"As the Respondents submitted, this Court observes, that the order in P5 only orders the Petitioner"
"and one Jagath Chandana not to interfere with the cultivation rights of the 2nd Respondent."
