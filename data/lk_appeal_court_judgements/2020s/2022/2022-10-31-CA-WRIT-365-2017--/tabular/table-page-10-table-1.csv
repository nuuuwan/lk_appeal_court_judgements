"The  Respondents  also  contended  that  a  section  90  inquiry  does  not  determine  the  title  or  the"
"substantive rights of a party. As per the wording, it is clear that to lodge a complaint under section"
"90, the title to the paddy  field  is not a requirement as  it can  be done  by  an owner cultivator or"
"occupier of agricultural lands. The said section only attempts to preserve the cultivating rights of"
"the owner cultivator or occupier of agricultural lands and safeguard them from any interference"
"pertaining to the acts that are stipulated in the said section."
"Locus standi of the Petitioner"
"The 2nd Respondent has challenged the Petitioner’s application on the basis that there is no locus"
"standi for the Petitioner to invoke the writ jurisdiction. It is the contention of the 2nd Respondent"
"that the Petitioner has failed to disclose the basis for his entitlement to the property in question and"
"if the Petitioner is an outsider or a third party who has no entitlement to the cultivation of property,"
"then he will have to fail in this application. In response, the Petitioner submits that as per document"
"P1, the tenant cultivator’s name is depicted as D. N. Mathangaweera. It is the contention of the"
"Petitioner that the said D. N. Mathangaweera is his grandfather. D. N. Mathangaweera had a son"
"called D.M. Mathangaweera, the father of the Petitioner. To substantiate this position the Petitioner"
"has tendered to this Court, the extracts of the agricultural land register (P1) which depicts the tenant"
"cultivator’s name as D.M Mathangaweera, the death certificate of his grandfather marked as P1(a)"
"and  the  marriage  certificate  of  his  father  marked  as  P1(b)  and  his  birth  certificate  as  P1(c)."
"However, this Court observes that the entry  in P1 has been cut off. This position has  also been"
"considered by the inquiring officer who held the original inquiry. In any event, we find there is a"
"discrepancy in the Petitioner’s claim, as his own documents contradict his contention. Even though"
"document  P1  describes  the  tenant  cultivator  as  D.N  Mathangaweera,  the  death  certificate  of"
"Petitioner’s  grandfather  names  the  deceased  as  D.  Saraneris  Mathangaweera.  Extracts  of  the"
"marriage registry of his father which was marked as P1(b) also gives the Petitioner’s grandfather’s"
"name as D. Saraneris Mathangaweera."
