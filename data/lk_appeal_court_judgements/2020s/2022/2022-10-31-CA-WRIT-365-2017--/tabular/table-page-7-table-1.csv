"At the  argument  stage, the  Petitioner  also  argued that  he  had  not  been  given  an  opportunity  to"
"cross-examine,  and  submitted that  it  again  is  a  violation  of  the  rules  of  natural  justice.  We  are"
"unable to agree with this submission as well, as this is only an inquiry under section 90 under the"
"Agrarian Development Act, pertaining to an interference by a 3rd party to the cultivation right of"
"the owner cultivator or the occupier. As for the Petitioner’s submission that he had not been given"
"a right to cross-examine, this Court observes that the Petitioner nor the 2nd Respondent had sought"
"to cross-examine any witnesses. In the absence of an application to cross-examine, the Petitioner"
"cannot be heard now to complain that he had been deprived of the right to cross-examine. It is also"
"pertinent to note, that there is no material to demonstrate that the inquiring officer had called for"
"evidence by witnesses under section 90, nor have the parties who appeared before the inquiring"
"officer applied to call for witnesses. Therefore, on this ground too, the Petitioner’s contention of"
"being  deprived  of  cross-examination  has  to  fail  as  the  question  of  a  right to  cross-examination"
"would not arise in the absence of witnesses."
"It is also pertinent to note that none of the parties had challenged the accuracy and the authenticity"
"of the documents that have been tendered. However, this Court also observes that in the original"
"inquiry  before  the  inquiring  officer,  the  Attorney-at-law  for  the  Petitioner  had  disputed  the"
"document marked as P3 at the initial inquiry. This too had been done on the basis that there was"
"no  inquiry  before  the  said  amendment  was  affected  to  the  document  marked  P3  at  the  inquiry"
"which is the paddy land register. However, it appears that the Petitioner has failed to dispute any"
"of the documents that have been tendered other than the document marked P3, before the inquiring"
"officer."
"The  Petitioner’s  next  contention  was,  that the  1st  Respondent  has  failed  to  give  reasons  for  his"
"purported decision. The order has been given on a complaint made by the 2nd Respondent under"
"section  90 of  the  Agrarian  Development  Act,  No.  46 of  2000  whereby  the  2nd  Respondent  had"
"complained  that  his  rights  to  cultivate  the  paddy  field  had  been  violated  by  the  actions  of  the"
"Petitioner and another who accompanied him. This would be an appropriate time to consider the"
"said section of the Agrarian Development Act. The said section reads as follows,"
"Section 90 (1) Where a complaint is made to the Commissioner General by any owner cultivator"
"or occupier of agricultural land that any person is interfering with or attempting to interfere with"
"the  cultivation  rights,  threshing  rights,  rights  of  using  a  threshing  floor,  the  right  of  removing"
