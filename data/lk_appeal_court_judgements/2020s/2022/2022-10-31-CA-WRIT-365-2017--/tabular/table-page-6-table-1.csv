"said submission was made on 12.06.2017 (P2), the inquiring officer also obtained a statement from"
"the owner of the paddy field."
"It is the contention of the Petitioner, that he had informed the inquiring officer of the non-receipt"
"of the letter notifying him to be present for the inquiry and therefore had informed the inquiring"
"officer  by  his  letter  dated  19.06.2017  to  grant  a  fresh  date  for  inquiry.  This  request  had  been"
"allowed  and  the  Petitioner  too  had  been  given  an  opportunity  to  make  submissions  and  tender"
"supporting  documents.  It  was  also  submitted,  that  the  inquiring  officer  after  the  receipt  of  the"
"Petitioner’s letter, had informed him to be present for the inquiry on 03.07.2017 and had said that"
"if the Petitioner  is unable to be present on that day,  he would  make a decision on the available"
"evidence. This clearly demonstrates that after the 2nd Respondent’s evidence, the 1st Respondent"
"had  not  made  a  decision  but  had  granted  time  to  hear  the  Petitioner.  The  said  inquiry  had"
"subsequently  been  refixed  for  the  23rd  of  October  but  due  to  the  complaint  made  by  the  2nd"
"Respondent, it had been advanced to the 14th of August 2017. The Petitioner had received the copy"
"of the said letter notifying the date on 12.07.2017 however, as the said date was not suitable for"
"the Petitioner’s  attorney-at-law, he  had  moved to another date on that day, and the  inquiry  had"
"been postponed to 23rd of August 2017."
