"It is to be noted that the Appellants failed to produce a single document"
"to establish the contention that the trustees have been selected upon"
"the recommendation of Koya Thangal. Having scrutinized the totality of"
"the evidence adduced before the Wakf Board it is well established that"
"the trustees of the said Mosque have been selected by the members of"
"the Jamaath."
"In these respects, it is the view of this Court that there is no basis to"
"interfere with the Order of the Wakf Board dated 29-07-2001 and the"
"Order  of  the  Wakf  Tribunal  dated  19-07-2003.  Thus,  the  appeal  is"
"dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/- payable by the Appellants to"
"the Respondents."
"The Registrar is directed to dispatch copies of this Order to the Wakf"
"Board and the Wakf Tribunal."
"Appeal dismissed."
