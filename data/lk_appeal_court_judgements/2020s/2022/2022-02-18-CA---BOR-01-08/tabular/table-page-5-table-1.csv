"allegation  is  baseless.  Without  coming  to  that  conclusion,  it  is  pointless  discussing  regarding"
"valuation."
"L
and  Acquisition  Act  had  allowed  the  citizens  to  claim  compensation.  Whenever  a  claimant  is"
"dissatisfied  with  an  award,  there  is  a  provision  for  review.  State  officials  should  be  considered"
"towards the citizens.   Public officers should do so with the public in mind in carrying out a duty."
"The citizens should be considered masters, and the officers, whatever their rank, are servants. Acts"

"W
hen considering the evidence given by U.G. Wijerathna witness produced by the Respondents for"
"the  inquiry  before  the  Board  of  Review,  the  question  arises  whether  the  fair  and  transparent"
"inspections were held? Proceedings of 14th September 2006 of the Board of Review the said witness"
"giving evidence had recorded there is no necessity to inform the claimants regarding his visit. When"

"require informing the owner or claimant or any person looking after the property except raids and"
"unlawful events."
"A
rguments put forward by the Respondents can only be considered. When there is evidence to come"
"to a conclusion that a fair and transparent procedure had followed. Indeed, the trees in the land may"
"not  be  used  as  commercial  timber.  There  can  be  disturbances  to  the  environment  and  the  forest"
