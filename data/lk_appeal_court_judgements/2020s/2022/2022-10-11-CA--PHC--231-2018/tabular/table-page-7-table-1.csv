accused.  As  held"
"Mawathagama  C  A 
(PHC)  46/2015  Court  of  Appeal  Minute  dated"
"27.11.2018 “…it is imperative to prove to the satisfaction of Court that the"
"vehicle owner in question has not only given instructions but also has taken"
"every possible step to implement them”"
"In Jalathge Surasena v Officer in Charge, Police Station of Hikkaduwa"
"CA  (PHC)  APN 100/2014, Minute dated  30.06.2015, it was held  that a"
"mere  denial  of  not  having  knowledge  of  the  offence  committed  is  not"
"sufficient to discharge the burden cast on a registered owner of a vehicle."
"In the instant application, neither the appellant (the registered owner of"
"the  vehicle)  nor  the  witness  (current  owner  of  the  vehicle)  have  shown"
"cause  so  as  to  satisfy  the  Court  that  either  one  of  them  has  taken  the"
"necessary  precautionary  measures 
to  prevent 
the  offence, 
thereby"
"discharging the burden cast on them, on a balance of probability. Hence,"
"the appellant’s contention that he had no knowledge of the offence being"
"committed itself brings to light the lax precautions taken by the registered"
"owner,  and  further  affirms  the  fact  that  he  has  not  taken  satisfactory"
"precautions to prevent the vehicle from being employed in acts of crime,"
"as a responsible owner of a vehicle."
"With the implementation of the Amendment Act, No. 65 of 2009, a higher"
"degree of burden of proof is set upon the owner of the vehicle. As per the"
"law set out in the amended Section 40 of the Act, the owner of a vehicle"
"must prove on a balance of probability that he has taken every possible"
"precautionary  measure  to  prevent  such  an  offence  being  committed."
"Merely giving instructions or claiming lack of knowledge of the diversion"
"of  the  vehicle  does  not  suffice  to  discharge  the  burden  placed  upon  an"
"owner by this amendment."
"Therefore,  owing  to  the  failure  of  either  party  to  prove  on  a  balance  of"
"probability, the prevalence of precautionary measures taken by them, to"
"the satisfaction of this Court, and the failure to dispense the burden cast"
