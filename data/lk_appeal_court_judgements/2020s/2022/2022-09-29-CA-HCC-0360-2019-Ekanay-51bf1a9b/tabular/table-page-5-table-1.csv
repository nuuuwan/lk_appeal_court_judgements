"","appellant. While conceding that the judgment of the"
"","learned trial Judge is in order, the learned Counsel"
"","for 
the  appellant  submitted 
that 
the  conviction"
"","however should not be allowed to stand as there is a"
"","possibility  that  the  mind  of  the  learned  trial  Judge"
"","may 
have 
been 
prejudiced 
on 
the 
above 
job"
"","applications  being  submitted  in  evidence,  and  also"
"","on  the  fact  that  the  bribery  officials  were  satisfied"
"","about  the  acceptance  of  bribes  where  the  said  job"
"","applications were submitted."
"8.","It  is  the  contention  of  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor"
"","General  for  the  respondent  that,  the  learned  trial"
"","Judge  in  his  judgment  at  page  7  (page  562  of  the"
"","appeal  brief)  has  expressly  stated  that,  what  was"
"","revealed  at  the  initial  investigation  with  regard  to"
"","the  genuineness  of 
the  complaint  would  not  be"
"","taken 
in 
to  consideration  when  arriving  at 
the"
"","judgment.  It  was  further  submitted  that,  the  other"
"","job 
applications 
that  were 
recovered 
from 
the"
"","possession of the appellant has not been taken into"
"","consideration by the learned High Court Judge."
"9.","The  PW1  (investigating  officer)  in  his  evidence  has"
"","said  that,  upon  receiving  the  information  against"
"","the 
appellant, 
his 
team 
investigated 
into 
the"
"","genuineness  of  the  complaint  and  it  was  revealed"
"","that 
the 
information  was  genuine.  However,  as"
"","submitted  by  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General,"
"","the  learned  trial  Judge  on  Page  7  of  his  judgment"
"","has clearly stated that he will consider that evidence"
"","only  for  the  purpose  of  deciding  on  the  steps  that"
"","the 
witness 
followed 
while 
conducting 
the"
"","investigation  and  not  on 
the 
truth  of  what 
the"
"","witness  said.  Therefore,  I  regret  to  hold  that  I  am"
"","unable  to  agree  with  the  contention  of  the  learned"
"","Counsel  for  the  appellant,  that  the  said  evidence"
"","has caused prejudice to the appellant."
