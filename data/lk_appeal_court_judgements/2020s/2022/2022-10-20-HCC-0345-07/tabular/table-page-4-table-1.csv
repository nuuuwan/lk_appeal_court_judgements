ustody  of  the  productions.  The  court  interpreter  gave  evidence  and  marked"
"the  Govt.  Analyst  report.  The  judgment  was  pronounced  on  15.3.2007.    An"
"open warrant was issued to arrest the appellant."
"The fact that the appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment would itself be"
"an  exceptional  ground 
to  consider 
this  appeal  as  a  revision  application."
"Therefore, I would consider the merits of the appeal as a revision application."
"When  the  appellant  was  produced  before  the  High  Court,  the  Counsel  who"
"appeared  for  him  had  not  called  the  appellant  to  testify  as  to  why  he  did  not"
"turn up for the trial.  Counsel could have done a better job in the High Court."
"On  behalf  of  the  appellant,  no  documentary  evidence  or  any  other  evidence"

"against the appellant in his absence had not considered the fact that whether"
"the appellant was absconding.  At the inquiry, no witness said or indicated that"
