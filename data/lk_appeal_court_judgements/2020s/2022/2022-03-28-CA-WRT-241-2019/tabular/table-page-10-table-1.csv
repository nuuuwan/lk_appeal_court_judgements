"Ranasinghe Bandara vs. The Director, District Land Reform Commission and"
"Others (Case No. CA.(Writ) 233/2017 decided on 17.06.2019),  His Lordship"
"Justice Janaka De Silva giving reference to Clive Lewis, Judicial Remedies in"
"Public Law, 5th Ed,248 (South Asian Edition) held as follows;"
"“Such legitimate expectations may arise where a public authority has"
"made a clear, unqualified and ambiguous representation to a particular"
"individual that it will act in a particular way.” The said basis adopted by"
"the respondents, in my view, is a sufficient overriding interest to justify"
"the cancellation of the Petitioner’s transfer."
"The Petitioner states that there are legitimate and genuine concerns which"
"require  her  to  remain  at  her  present  placement  at  Devananda  College,"
"Amabalangoda.    Simultaneously,  she  claims  that  a  reallocation  to  Ananda"
"College, Elpitiya would cause her grave hardship and prejudice. In terms of"
"the  said  Circular  on  National  Teacher  Transfer  Policy  P21,  among  other"
"grounds  the  reason  of  health  condition  of  the  particular  teacher  and  the"
"family members of such teacher who are in a condition/state to make a direct"
"impact  to  the  teacher  also  can  be  considered  in  arriving  at  a  decision  in"
"respect of a transfer. However, I am of the view that the maximum stipulated"
"service period served in a convenient school as referred to in the said National"
"Policy P21 bears more weight than any other ground in this case that has to"
"be considered in deciding upon a transfer."
"Another  argument  taken  up  by  the  Petitioner  is  that  there  are  no  reasons"
"given in letter P20 for the decision of the authority. Nevertheless, Petitioner"
"has been informed that the cancellation of her transfer has been done in view"
"of the recommendations given by the 2nd Respondent to the Board of Appeal"
"of National Teacher Transfer 2019 by letter marked P20. Further to that the"
"pleadings of the Respondents reveals that the Petitioner’s transfer has been"
"cancelled to overcome an administrative oversight occurred by overlooking"
"the  vital  of  requirements  specified  in  the  National  Teacher  Transfer  Policy"
"bearing No.2007/20 (p21). Hence, I am of the view that the 2nd Respondent"
"has given adequate reasons for his decision as contained in P20."
