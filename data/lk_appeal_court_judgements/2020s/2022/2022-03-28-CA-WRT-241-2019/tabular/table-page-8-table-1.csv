"exactly the same; an improper motive or a false step in procedure, will"
"make an administrative act just as illegal or invalid as does a flagrant"
"excess or authority……”"
"Therefore, in an event where the 2nd Respondent has taken into consideration"
"irrelevant matters, I am of the view that the decision of the Respondents to"
"consider  the  alleged  Appeal  of  the  5th  Respondent  R2 
is  one  guided  by"
"irrelevant considerations and therefore, is ultra vires."
"T
hough the matters remain as such it is observed that the transfer of the 5th"
"respondent  (R5)  has  not  been  cancelled.  The  Respondents  in  their  written"
"submissions  conceded 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
letter  of 
transfer  of 
the  5th"
"Respondent marked as R5 to Ananda College, Elpitiya had been effectuated"
"and  enforced.  For  such  reasons,  granting  prayers  (e)  and  (f)  prayed  in  the"
"Petition would become redundant."
"Now I will consider the consequences arising out of the impugned decision to"
"cancel the Petitioner’s transfer (P20). One of the contentions of the Petitioner"
"is that the impugned decision reflecting in P20 is a direct consequence and a"
"result of a political influence of a local politician. The Respondent’s contention"
"is that the said transfer has been effectuated as a result of an administrative"
"oversight  and  such  oversight  has  only  been  discovered  subsequent  to  an"
"inquiry into the alleged Appeal (R2) by the Teacher Transfer Appeal Board."
"Fundamentals of the National Policy of the Teacher transfers are promulgated"
"in the Circular No.2007/20 (P21).  The Clause 3 of the said Circular P21 specify"
"the special factors which are to be taken into consideration in giving effect to"
"a teacher’s transfer. In terms of Clause 3.1 of the Circular P21, the maximum"
"stipulated  period  of  service  that  a  particular  teacher  could  serve 
in  a"
"convenient  school  and  also  in  a  most  convenient  school  are  factors  to  be"
"taken into consideration in arriving at a decision in respect of a transfer of a"
"teacher. The Devananda College, Ambalangoda and Ananda Central College,"
"Elpitiya  are 
categorized  as  most 
convenient  and 
convenient 
schools"
"respectively. In terms of the Clause 3.1 of the said Circular P21, the maximum"
"period a teacher could serve in a convenient school is 08 years and 06 years"
"in reference to most convenient school. However, the Petitioner had served"
