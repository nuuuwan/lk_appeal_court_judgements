"appeals as well as who have not. Therefore, the Petitioner had been informed"
"that no appeal could be accepted again. Meanwhile, the 5th Respondent had"
"been 
temporarily 
released 
to  said  Devananda  College 
in  place  of 
the"
"Petitioner. The Petitioner states that, she has duly accepted the said transfer"
"and that she has not tendered any appeal against her transfer to Devananda"
"College. Therefore, the Petitioner claims that, there is no reasons for the 2nd"
"Respondent  to  cancel  her  transfer  without  conducting  an  inquiry  and  also"
"without giving reasons for such action. The Petitioner further claims that she"
"has not been afforded with an opportunity to appeal against said cancelation"
"of her transfer. Therefore, the Petitioner’s contention is that said decision of"
"the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  to  cancel  her  transfer  is  in  violation  of  the"
"principles  of  natural 
justice,  due  process  and  against 
the  Petitioner’s"
"legitimate  expectation. 
In  the  above  premise,  the  Petitioner  seeks  the"
"intervention of this Court inter alia by way of,"
"• 
a Writ of Certiorari quashing the impugned decision of the 1st and 2nd"
"Respondents to cancel the annual transfer of Petitioner to Devananda"
"College by letter dated 15.05.2019 marked P20,"
"• 
 a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st and 2nd Respondent"
"to 
transfer 
the  5th  Respondent 
to 
the  Devananda  College 
in"
"replacement of the Petitioner,"
"• 
a Writ of Prohibition restraining the 1st and 2nd Respondents from giving"
"effect to the said cancellation of the Petitioner’s transfer and"
"• 
a  Writ  of  Mandamus  directing  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  to  duly"
"implement  the  annual  transfer  of  the  Petitioner  as  contained  in  the"
"letter dated 14.02.2019(P16)."
"The 1st to 4th and 6th Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the"
"Respondents)  state  that  in  terms  of  the  National  Teachers  Transfer  Policy"
"bearing  No.2007/20  marked  P21  the  Petitioner  is  eligible  to  apply  for  a"
"transfer of her choice after the completion of the maximum number of years"
"in a school stipulated therein. The Petitioner had served Devananda College"
"for more than 10 years previously and thereafter only the Petitioner had been"
"transferred  to  Ananda  Central  College,  Elpitiya.  The  Petitioner  had  served"
"Ananda Central College, Elpitiya for eight months at the time she applied for"
