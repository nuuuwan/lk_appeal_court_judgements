"conferred results in a nullity. In the above premise, I am of the view that the"
"alleged  Appeal  R2  does  not  constitute  a  valid  Appeal

"Respondent’s  transfer  to  Ananda  Central  College,  Elpitiya  and  the  decision"
"taken  by  the  Teacher  Transfer  Appeal  Board  to  entertain  the  said  alleged"
"Appeal R2 itself is an act in excess of power."
"The  Respondents  claim  that  the  alleged  Appeal  R2  submitted  by  the  5th"
"Respondent has been duly considered by the Teacher Transfer Appeal Board"
"and thereafter only the revised transfer has been effectuated. If an appeal is"
"to be considered, such appeal has to be forwarded by the respective Teacher"
"through the Principal of the particular school in which such teacher is serving."
"The purported Appeal R2 is not in conformity with the said requirements and"
"in my view does not constitute a valid Appeal. Therefore, the contents of the"
"said document R2 cannot be considered in favor of the 5th Respondent. The"
"consideration  of  the  contents  of  the  alleged  Appeal  R2  shall  amount  to"
"irrelevant consideration by the Teacher Transfer Appeal Board."

"‘’when a discretion is vested in a statutory body, it is never unfettered."
"It  must  be  exercised  according  to  law.  The  statutory  body  must  be"

"matters that are irrelevant.’’"
"Moreover, it appears that the alleged Appeal R2 was a politically influenced"
