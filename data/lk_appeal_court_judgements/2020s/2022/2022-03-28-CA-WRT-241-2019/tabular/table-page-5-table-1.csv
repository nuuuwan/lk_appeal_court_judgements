"a transfer by her application marked P15 in view of the Annual Transfers for"
"Year  2019.  Thereafter, 
the  Petitioner’s 
transfer  application  had  been"
"accepted  and  she  had  been  transferred  to  Devananda  College  with  effect"
"from 20.02.2019. Meantime, the Teacher Transfer Appeal Board has received"
"an appeal (R2) from the 5th Respondent against her transfer to Ananda Central"
"College,  Elpitiya.  The  Respondents  state  that  upon  an  inquiry  into  the  said"
"Appeal, said Board has discovered that the vacancy created in Ananda Central"
"College, Elpitiya due to the Petitioner’s transfer to Devananda College shall be"
"filled  by  the  5th  Respondent  by  her  being  transferred  to  Ananda  Central"
"College,  Elpitiya.  Nevertheless,  since  the  Petitioner  had  earlier  served 
in"
"Devananda College for period over 10 years, the Respondents claim that the"
"Petitioner’s  transfer  to  Devananda  College  was  contrary  to  the  National"
"Teacher  Transfer  Policy  reflected  in  P21.    The  Respondents  claim  that  the"
"same occurred merely due to an administrative oversight owing to the fact"
"that  a  large  number  of  annual  transfer  requests  received  from  teachers"
"attached to various national school island wide. Based on the above grounds,"
"the  said  Appeal 
(R2)  of  the  5th  Respondent  had  been  considered  and"
"accordingly,  the  Petitioner’s  transfer  to  Devananda  College,  Ambalangoda"
"had  been  cancelled  by  letter  marked  P20.  The  Respondents  claim  that  the"
"issuance  of  the  letter  P20  was  to  regularize  the  administrative  oversight"
"occurred in transferring the Petitioner to Devananda College, Ambalangoda."
"The Respondent’s stance is that if the letter P20 had not been issued to the"
"Petitioner it would have been contrary to the National Transfer Policy and the"
"code of regulations bearing No.1589/30. At the argument stage, both Counsel"
"made  submissions  and  additionally,  parties  were  permitted  to  file  their"
"respective written submissions."
"As  mentioned  above,  the  Petitioner  has  been  informed  of  her  transfer  to"
"Devananda  College,  Ambalangoda  by  letter  dated  14.02.2019  marked  P16."
"Upon  perusal  of  the  said  letter  P16,  it  appears  that,  if  the  Petitioner  was"
"aggrieved by her transfer to Devananda College, Ambalangoda, then she was"
"required to forward an appeal to the 2nd Respondent through the Principal of"
"the School in which she is currently serving within 14 days from the receipt of"
"the letter P16. Further, it had been informed by way of letter P16 that any"
"such appeal which has not been forwarded through the Principal of the School"
