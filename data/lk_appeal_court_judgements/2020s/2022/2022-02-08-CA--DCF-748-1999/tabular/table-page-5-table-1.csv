"The 10th Respondent does not say that her late husband Siriwardane  had soil"
"rights in the land called Bopewatte (Bopagewatte). She does not say Siriwardane"
"constructed 
the  boutique  rooms  on 
the 
land  or  Siriwardane  owned 
the"
"buildings. She only says that Siriwardane was carrying on a business there in the"
"name of ආසිරි stores."
"As  the  learned  District  Judge  has  correctly  observed  the  Petitioner  had  not"
"included  the  business 
in  the  name  of  “Asiri  Stores” 
in  the 
inventory.  The"
"contents  of  the  deed  No.  6745  marked  2ව1  shows  the  deceased  Testator"
"Punchimahattaya  owned  soil  rights  and  buildings  in  Bopagewatte.  Therefore,"
"that property can be included in the inventory and there is no reason to exclude"
"it from the inventory."
"Exclusion of “Hathepmewatte” (හැතැප්බේවත්ත)"
"In the inventory there is a reference to Hathepmewatte which reads as follows,"
"1.

"The 10th Respondent in her amended Petition had stated that both the deceased"
"testator Punchimahattaya and his brother Siriwardane inherited this property"
"from  their  parents  and  the  buildings  standing  thereon  namely  the  boutique"
"rooms  and  bakery  were  constructed 
jointly  by  the  deceased  testator  and"
"Siriwardane  and  both  had  incurred  expenditure  in  those  constructions  and"
"Siriwardane managed the property. The 10th Respondent had further stated that"
"the bakery which was standing on that land was owned by Siriwardane and it"
"was registered in his name and later in his son’s name. Siriwardane was running"
"the business in the name of “Manoranjanee” in this premises."
"The  Petitioner  has  not 
included  the  entire 
land  “Hathepmewatte” 
in  the"
"inventory. He had included only a 1/5 share of the soil rights in Hathepmewatte"
"in  the  inventory.  Therefore,  it  appears  that  the  Petitioner  had  included  the"
"undivided rights owned by the deceased testator. As the learned District Judge"
"has correctly observed, the Court cannot decide the exact share of undivided"
"rights in Hathepmewatte owned by the deceased testator. It is a subject matter"
"of  a  different  action.  In  the  case  of  Pathmanathan  v  Thuraisingham  (74  NLR"
"196), it was held that disputed claims cannot be adjudicated upon in an inquiry"
"relating 
to 
the 
judicial 
settlement  of 
the 
accounts  of 
executors
