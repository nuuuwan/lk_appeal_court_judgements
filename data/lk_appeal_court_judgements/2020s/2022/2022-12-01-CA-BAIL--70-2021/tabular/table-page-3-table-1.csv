"MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J."
"The 
instant  matter  has  been 
filed  under  the  of  the  Provisions  of"
"Assistance  to  and  Protection  of  Victims  of  Crimes  and  Witnesses  Act"
"No. 4 of 2015."
"Counsel for the Accused stated that although indictment has been filed"
"in the substantive matter the Accused has been in remand since his date"
"of  arrest  without  the  trial  being  taken  up,  and  in  addition  to  that  the"
"Accused is suffering from a heart condition in which it has been brought"
"to the notice of Court that his left coronary artery is 95% blocked. This"
"submission is substantiated by medical report submitted under the hand"
"of consultant cardiologist from the National Hospital of Kandy."
"The  DSG  appearing  in  this  matter  objected  to  this  application  on  the"
"basis  that  the  Accused  initially  had  been  absconding  from  High  Court"
"and thereafter trial had been fixed to be taken in his absence, upon the"
"warrant  being 
issued  the  Accused  had  been  taken 
into  custody  and"
"produced before the High Court and he had been remanded. Therefore,"
"the DSG urged that he had been remanded in order to make sure that"
"he  appears  to  face  the  trial,  but 
if  he 
is  enlarged  on  bail  he  might"
"abscond  as  per  his  previous  conduct.  Therefore, 
the 
learned  DSG"
"differentiated facts of this case from other cases because of the warrant"
"issued  against  the  Accused  and  invited  Court  to  consider  this  matter"
"accordingly."
"As per the law pertaining to the above mentioned Act when an Accused"
"is arrested and  charged under the instant Act they can be enlarged on"
"bail  only  upon  exceptional  circumstances  by  the  Court  of  Appeal.  The"
"term exceptional has not been defined in the statute but in the cases so"
