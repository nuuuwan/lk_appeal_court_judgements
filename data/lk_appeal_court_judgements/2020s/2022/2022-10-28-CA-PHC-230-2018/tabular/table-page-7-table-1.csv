"Prasanna Jayawardena held that,"
"“..With regard to a claim of a right of way of necessity, the claimant is not"
"required to prove possession or user of the right of way. Instead, a claimant"
"who seeks a declaration from Court that he is entitled to a right of way of"
"necessity over the land of another, must satisfy Court that: the situation of"
"the claimant’s land is such that, the only route which can be used from the"
"Claimant’s  land  [without  having  to  undergo  unreasonable  inconvenience  or"
"difficulty] to access a public road or other roadway from which a public road"
"can be accessed, is by traversing over the land of another person and that,"
"therefore, by reason of necessity, he is entitled to a declaration from Court"
"that he is entitled to a right of way of necessity over that person’s land to"
"access the public road or roadway.. [emphasis added]”"
