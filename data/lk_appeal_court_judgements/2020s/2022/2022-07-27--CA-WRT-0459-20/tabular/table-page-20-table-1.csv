"The  doctrine  of  legitimate  expectations  as  per  Wade  &  Forsyth  stems  from"
"fairness, the need to protect against the abuse of power, legal certainty, and protection of"
"the  citizens’  trust  in  the  system.  As  Wade & Forsyth  observe  (at  p.  450),  “Where  some"
"boon or benefit has been promised by an official that boon or benefit may be legitimately"
"expected by those who have placed their trust in the promises of the official. It would be"
"unfair  to  dash  those  expectations  without  at  least  granting  the  person  affected  an"
"opportunity to show the official why his discretion should be exercised in a way that fulfils"
"his expectation.”"
"Lord  Diplock  in  the  landmark  judgment  of  Council  of  Civil  Service  Unions  v."
"Minister for the Civil Service  [1985] AC 374  noted that it is preferable to refer to such"
"expectations as “legitimate” instead of “reasonable” so as to indicate that the former has"
"consequences to which effect will be given in public law.  His Lordship observed legitimate"
"expectations arise when decisions affect a person:"
