"“the court should weigh the character and substance of the expectation and the"
"prejudice caused to the petitioner by its frustration, on the one hand; against the"
"importance of the public interest which led to the public authority’s change of heart, on"
"the other hand; and then decide whether that exercise of weighing the competing interests"
"leads to the conclusion that the petitioner’s expectation is of such weight and the"
"consequences of its frustration are so prejudicial to him when compared to the public"
"interest relied on by the public authority, that the public authority’s decision to change"
"its policy and negate the expectation was disproportionate or unfair or unjust and"
"amounted to an abuse of power which should be quashed; or whether the decision to"
"change the policy should stand because the public authority has acted proportionately,"
"f
a
irly and justly when it decided that the petitioner’s substantive legitimate expectation"
"could not be granted since public interest demanded a change of policy.”"
