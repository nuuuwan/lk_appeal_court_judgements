"In Collettes v. Bank of Ceylon [1984] 2 SLR 253, his Lordship Sharvananda J. (as"
"he then was) held:"
"â€œThis Court undoubtedly has the jurisdiction to revise the concurrent findings of"
"f
act reached by the lower court in appropriate cases. However, ordinarily, it will not"
"interfere  with  findings  of  fact  based  upon  relevant  evidence  except  in  special"
"c
ircumstances, such as, for instance, where the judgment of the lower court shows that"
"the relevant evidence bearing on a fact has not been considered or irrelevant matters have"
"been  given  undue  importance  or  that  the conclusion  rests mainly  on  erroneous"
"considerations or is not supported by sufficient evidence. When the judgment of the lower"
"court exhibits such shortcomings, this court not only may, but is under a duty to examine"
