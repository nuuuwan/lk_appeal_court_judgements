here is a significant difference between the two methods set out in Sections 9 and"
"13 – i.e. Section 13 does not contain a reference to Section 36 of the Rent Act. Thus,"
"a surviving spouse or child of a tenant who was a member of the household of the"
"tenant was not considered a tenant for the purposes of making an application under"
"Section 13. The position therefore is that in terms of Section 13, the right to make an"
"application to purchase a house is limited to the tenant. In the event of the death of"
"the tenant, the right to make an application does not extend to his spouse or child."
