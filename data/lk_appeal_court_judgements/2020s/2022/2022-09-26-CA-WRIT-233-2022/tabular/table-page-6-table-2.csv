"bail of persons accused or suspected of having committed or convicted of offences"
"under such other written law."
"Similarly,  the  attention  should  be  drawn  to  Section  15C  of  the  Antiquities  Ordinance"
"which makes express provisions in respect of release on bail of persons charged with or"
"accused of offences under the said Ordinance. Therefore, persons charged with or accused"
"of offences under the Antiquities Ordinance falls within the 3rd category above.  As a result,"
"the provisions of the Bail Act do not apply to persons charged with or accused of offences"
"under the Antiquities Ordinance."
"Hence,  based  on  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  I  am  of  the  view  that  it  is  very  much"
"premature to decide whether the Petitioner is guilty or not of the alleged illegal excavation"
"and further, it is not this Court but the learned Magistrate is the best person to assay the"
"actions of the Petitioner and decide whether he has been a party to the said excavation."
"Moreover, the Petitioner has failed, prima facie, to establish that the learned Magistrate"
"has made an order against the law or the learned Magistrate has exceeded his powers in"
"exercising his jurisdiction. Therefore, I am of the view that the Petitioner has not submitted"
"an  arguable  case  which  warrants  this  Court  to  issue  formal  notice  of  this  case  on  the"
"Respondents. Hence, I proceed to refuse the application of the Petitioner."
