"Therefore, the learned High Court judge has basically rejected the evidence of the"
"prosecution  on 
the  basis  of 
the  statements  of 
the  witnesses  being  made"
"belatedly,  and  the 
lack  of 
illumination  at  the  time  of 
identification  of  the"
"respondents by the witnesses."
"The  Additional  Solicitor  General  appearing  for  the  Attorney  General  stated  that"
"he  is  playing  the  role  of  an  amicus  to  Court  in  this  instance  and  he  too  has"
"concerns regarding the belatedness of the statements of the prosecution and the"
"improbability  of  the  prosecution  story  at  times  and  he  added  that  he  is  not"
"supporting the submissions of the appellant."
"The two Counsels who appeared for the respondents stated that analysis of the"
"High  Court  Judge  with  regard  to  the  evidence  of  the  prosecution  is  the  only"
"conclusion he could have arrived at, in view of the belatedness of the evidence of"
"the prosecution and the improbability of the prosecution story at times."
"Both the Counsel for the respondents vehemently objected for the request of the"
"Counsel  for  the  appellant  for  the  instant  case  to  be  sent  for  a  retrial  or  for  the"
"acquittal to be revised. They quoted the case  of Attorney General vs  Baranage"
"where  Amaratunga  J  had  held  that”in  an  appeal  against  an  acquittal  on  a"
"question  of  fact  the  prosecution  has  a  heavy  burden  to  discharge.  Such  an"
"appeal could only be justified if there had been a palpable misdirection by the"
"judge when considering the facts of the case which could be demonstrated to be"
"wrong  on  the  very  face  of  the  record  and  which  had  in  effect  resulted  in  a"
"miscarriage of justice”"
"Upon consideration of the submissions of all parties this Court is of the opinion"
"that 
the  story  narrated  by 
the  witnesses  of 
the  prosecution  gravelly 
lack"
"spontaneity  and  probability  in  view  of  the  statements  being  made  after  seven"
