"years from  the incident and as very correctly pointed out by the  trial judge the"
"alleged  behavior  of  the  8th  respondent  is    highly  improbable  in  view  of  the  fact"
"the 8th respondent being a police officer, and even the behavior of the brother of"
"the abductee is also very unlikely ,because he being an army officer did not take"
"legitimate steps to lodge a formal complaint soon after the incident in a suitable"
"place. Furthermore the identification of the respondents inside the police bus is"
"also very unbelievable in view of the level of illumination available at the time of"
"the incident. Therefore the learned trial judge has arrived at the only conclusion"
"possible in view of the evidence of the prospection."
"At this point this Court draws its attention to the case of Tudor Perera v AG (SC"
"23/75  D.C.  Colombo  Bribery  190/B  where  justice  Rajarathnam  has  held  that  “"
"…when  considering  the  evidence  of  an  interested  witness  who  may  desire  to"
"conceal  the  truth,  such  evidence  must  be  scrutinized  with  some  care.  The"
"independent  witness  will  normally  be  reffered  to  an  interested  witness  in  a"
"case  of  conflict.  Matters  of  motive,  prejudice,  partiality,  accuracy,  incentive,"
"and  reliability  have  all  to  be  weighed  (Vide,  Halsbury 
laws  of  England,  4th"
"Edition, para 29). Therefore, the relative weight attached to the evidence of an"
"interested witness who is a near relative of the accused or whose interests are"
"closely 
identified  by  one  party  may  not  prevail  over  the  testimony  of  an"
"independent  witness 
(Vide,Hasker 
v 
Summers(1884) 
10  V.L.R 
(Eq.)204-"
"Australia; Leefunteum v Beaudoin (1897)28 S.C.R.89-Canadda).Therefore in the"
"instant matter the trila judge had to evaluate the evidence of family members"
"of the  abductee hence as stated in  the above judgment the  trial judge had  to"
"evidence 
  weigh 
the  evidence  as  opposed 
to  motive  prejudice  partiality"
"accuracy incentive and reliability."
