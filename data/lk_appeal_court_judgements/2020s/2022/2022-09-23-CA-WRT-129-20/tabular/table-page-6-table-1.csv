"The Atkinian formula was revised by Lord Diplock in O’Reilly v. Mackman [1982] 3"
"WLR 1096 by dropping the words “having the duty to act judicially.” Lord Diplock held:"
"“…this  phrase  gave  rise  to  many  attempts,  with  varying  success,  to  draw  subtle"
"distinctions between decisions that were quasi-judicial and those that were administrative"
"only. But the relevance of arguments of this kind was destroyed by the decision of this House"
"in Ridge v. Baldwin [1964] A.C. 40, where again the leading speech was given by Lord Reid."
"Wherever  any  person  or  body  of  persons  has  authority  conferred  by  legislation  to  make"
"decisions of the kind I have described, it is amenable to the remedy of an order to quash its"

"powerful engines of authority must be prevented from running amok”."
"The  classical  statement  of  the  grounds  of  judicial  review  by  Lord  Diplock  in  the"

"of administrative action is based upon one or more of the following, viz. legality, procedural"
"impropriety, and irrationality. Proportionality was envisaged as a future possibility."
"Thus,  if  a  decision  is  found  to  be  vitiated  by  illegality,  irrationality,  procedural"
"impropriety, or is found to be disproportionate, the decision would be nullified."
"In terms of the initial approval granted by the Central Environmental Authority on"
"15th June 2007, which granted environmental approval subject to the terms and conditions"

"“The  Project  Proponent  should  undertake  to  release  an  adequate  volume  of  water"
"down  stream  for  maintaining  a  healthy  ecology  and  for  utility  of  down  stream  users.  To"
"maintain the downstream in proper condition a continuous uninterrupted discharge of 500"
"l/s (base flow of the river) should be released to the downstream from the weir by means of"
"uncontrolled outlets made in several places of the weir to cover the entire width of the river..”"
