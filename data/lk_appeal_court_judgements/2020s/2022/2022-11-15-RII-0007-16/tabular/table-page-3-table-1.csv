"learned  district  judge  has  said  with  regard  to  deed  No.  6820,  as  reproduced",""
"","“The  document  marked  as  8.D.1  is  partly  decayed  and  it  cannot  be"
"","deciphered in any way. Furthermore, 8 D.1 does not say as to what is the"
"","land  relevant  to  that  document.  All  the  suggestions  made  with  effect  to"
"","that such a document has been executed in respect of the subject matter"
"","of the action has been vehemently refused by the plaintiff. If at least the"
"","extracts  of  the  Registration  Folios  were  produced,  the  Court  could  have"
"","ascertained as to what land the said document relates. The 8th defendant"
"","who relies upon the said document has not taken any steps to prove that"
"document.  Furthermore,  Josage  Nonahamy,","claimed 
to  have  been"
"","obtained rights from 8 D.1 has executed deeds P.07, P.08, 8D.2 and 8D.3,"
"","after  the  date  of  8D.1,  but  she  has  not referred  to  rights  obtained  from"
"deed No. 6820 (8D.1).",""
"","The said Josage Nonahamy has alienated her maternal inheritance by all"
"those  deeds.  Furthermore,","the  8th  defendant,  when  she  was  cross"
"","examined, has stated that she did not have the original of 8D.1 with her,"
"","but she received it from a surveyor called Mr. Wickremasinghe. Therefore,"
"","on matters that has been established with regard to 8 D.1 and its contents"
"","I hold that it has not been proved that the said document pertains to the"
"","land which is the subject matter of this action. Hence, I hold, on a balance"
"","of probability, that the original owner Josage Nicholas Perera died without"
"","alienating any share of the land and his rights were inherited by his wife"
"and children”.",""
