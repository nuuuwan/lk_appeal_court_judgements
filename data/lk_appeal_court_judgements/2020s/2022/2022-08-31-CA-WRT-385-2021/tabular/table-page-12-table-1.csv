"always the option for an employee whose services have been terminated on disciplinary"
"grounds. The judicial control over public power has been expanded tremendously over the"
"years by judicial activism. In that sense, an employee whose services have been terminated"
"on non-disciplinary grounds should have a proper locus to get his grievances adjudicated."
"Therefore,  I  am  of  the  view  that  an  employee  in  a  scheduled  employment  who  is  on"
"probation, at least should have the privilege of making an application under TEWA in an"
"instance of termination of his services on non-disciplinary grounds."
"Petitioner is not entitled to reliefs."
"In light of the foregoing, I am not inclined to grant any reliefs as prayed for in the prayer"
"of the Petition. Hence, I proceed to dismiss the application of the Petitioner. However, I"
"take the view that this determination should not be an impediment for the Petitioner to"
"take  disciplinary  action,  if  any,  according  to  law,  against  the  3rd  Respondent  without"
"prejudice to all the rights of the Petitioner in reference to Commissioner’s order, marked"
"‘P3’."
