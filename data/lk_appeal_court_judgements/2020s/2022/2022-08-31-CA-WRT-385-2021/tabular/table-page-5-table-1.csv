"reasons  beyond  his  control,  his  period  of  probation  may  be  extended  by  a  reasonable"
"period of time to enable him to qualify."
"In  Clause  11:4  of  the  said  Establishment  Code,  the  appointing  authority  will  have  the"
"power  to  terminate  the  officerâ€™s  appointment  during  the  period  of  probation  without"
"assigning any reason. However, in my view, the appointing authority is empowered to do"
"so, inescapably subject to the effective procedure laid down in the relevant Chapter of the"
"Establishment Code."
"Hence, I take the view that when an employer takes a decision to extend the probationary"
"period or to terminate the services, he should follow a procedure, according to law, where"
"such  decision-making  power  may  not  infringe  the  Rule  of  Law  and  the  principles  of"
"Natural Justice. In light of the above, I hold that any employer should mandatorily follow"
"an effective procedure right throughout the period of probation if an employer needs to"
"enjoy the benefit of not confirming probationers as per the propositions in the aforesaid"
"judgements cited by the Petitioner. Further, it is abundantly clear that no employee can"
"escape without giving reasons under section 2(5) of TEWA."
"It  cannot  be  assumed  that  the  Superior  Courts  in  those  judgements  have  bestowed  an"
"absolute  discretion  to  the  employer  in  respect  of  an  employee  who  is  on  probation,"
"although the dicta of those judgements enumerate that the probationer has no right to be"
"confirmed in the post. Similar view has been taken by Mark Fernando J. in State Distilleries"
"Corporation  vs.  Rupasinghe  (1994)  2  Sri.  L.R.  395.  As  I  have  observed  above,  every"
"employee serving on probation must be treated according to a proper  review procedure"
"and such employee should have a right to know his shortcomings in advance. Therefore,"
"the  present  position  of  the  law  should  be  that  the  services  of  an  employee  who  is  on"
"probation can be terminated if his services are unsatisfactory and he is not suitable to carry"
"out the work assigned to him, provided that (a). the employer has treated the employee"
"with  a  helping  hand  to  overcome  his  shortcomings,  (b).  a  proper  review  procedure  has"
"been adopted (c). and most importantly such decision to terminate has been taken subject"
"to the provisions of the section 2 (particularly2(1) & 2(4)) of TEWA."
"I have arrived at the above conclusions after carefully perusing all the judgements cited by"
"the Petitioner & Respondents and also by taking into consideration the scheme of TEWA"
"and the Industrial Disputes Act. It will be unfair to the employee and may be in another"
