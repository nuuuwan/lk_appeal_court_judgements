"terminating  an  employee  who  is  a  probationer.  In  my  view,  before  the  services  of  an"
"employee  on  probation  is  terminated  on  disciplinary  grounds  (as  mentioned  in  Section"
"2(5) of TEWA), a proper inquiry should be held. I do not intend to brand such an inquiry"
"as a ‘preliminary inquiry’/ ‘domestic inquiry/ or ‘any other’; but what is essential is to"
"conduct  an  inquiry  upholding  the  rule  of  natural  justice,  a  principal  which  cannot  be"
"hindered under any circumstances according to the well-established related law."
"Moreover, if the termination during the period of probation is on disciplinary grounds,"
"then the employer is bound to give reasons under section 2(5) of the TEWA."
"The duty of the Commissioner at the threshold stage of an inquiry under TEWA is to ascertain from the employer"
"whether the termination is based on disciplinary or non-disciplinary grounds._____________________________"
"Now, I advert to examine the other facet of the Petitioner’s arguments in this case which"
"are based on the purported reasons submitted at the inquiry before the Commissioner, for"
"termination  of  services  of  the  3rd  Respondent.  The  Petitioner  contends  that  the  3rd"
"Respondent’s inefficiency, misconduct and insubordination caused the Petitioner to serve"
"the purported letter of termination and accordingly, the Commissioner has no jurisdiction"
"to entertain a complaint on termination based on inefficiency and misconduct as per the"
"provisions of Section 2(4) of TEWA."
"The Section 2(4) of the TEWA;"
