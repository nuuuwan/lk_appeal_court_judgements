"","affidavits  she  filed  in  the  High  Court.    The  learned  trial  Judge  has  taken  that"
"","also into account to find the evidence of DW1 to be incredible.  In his judgment"
"","the  learned  trial  Judge  has  said  that  DW1  has  failed  to  complain  against  the"
"","police  officers  to  the  higher  authorities  or  the  Human  Rights  Commission  or"
"","the  officers  who  are 
involved 
in  protecting  human  rights. 
  It 
is  common"
"","knowledge that most of the ordinary citizens are reluctant to complain against"
"","the  authorities  due  to  fear  of  further  arrestment.  Of  course,  there  are  some"
"","members of the public who will make complaints against the higher authorities."
"","The  fact  that  DW1  did  not  complain  to  the  authorities  also  was  taken  into"
"","account  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  to  conclude  that  her  evidence  is"
"","incredible.  Hence, I find that the evidence of DW1 (wife of the appellant) has"
"","been unfairly rejected by the learned High Court Judge."
"17.","DW2  who  testified  on  behalf  of  the  defence  has  been  a  neighbour  of  the"
"","appellant.   Upon  questioning,  DW2  has  clearly  given  her  address  as  No. 367,"
"","Bogaha  Thotupala  Para,  Uswatta,  Kandana.    She  has  clearly  said  that  his"
"","house is in the vicinity bearing No. 367 and her house number is 367/E. Upon"
"","questioning  by  the  prosecution,  she  has  said  that  the  house  number  of  the"
"","appellant  is  also  367.  However,  her  house  number  is  367/E.  When  she  was"
"","questioned about the inmates of house number 33/A, she has said that she does"
"","not know. However, she has clearly said that her house is situated opposite the"
"","appellant’s  house.  For  that  reason,  the  learned  trial  Judge  has  rejected  her"
"","evidence on the basis that it is not clear whether the DW2 was the appellant’s"
"","neighbour. 
  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  the 
learned  trial  Judge  has  unfairly"
"","rejected the evidence of DW2 on flimsy grounds."
