"attributed Lord Ellenborough in Rex Vs. Cocharane (1814 Gurneyes Report"
"499) which reads:"
"“no person accused of crime is bound to offer any explanation of his conduct"
"or of circumstances of suspicion which attach to him, but nevertheless but if"
"he refuses to do so where a strong prima facie case had been made out and"
"when it is in his power to offer evidence, if such exist in explanation of such"
"suspicious  appearances,  which  would  show  them  to  be  fallacious  and"
"explicable consistency with his innocence, it is a reasonable and justifiable"
"conclusion that he refrains from doing so only from the conviction that the"
"evidence  so  suppressed  or  not  adduced  would  operate  adversely  to  his"
"interest.”"
