"reasonable doubt before he considered the defence of the appellants, which he"
"termed as a misdirection in law which has caused a prejudice to the appellants."
"The main contention of the Learned Counsel for the second and the fifth accused"
"appellants was that to formulate an unlawful assembly by five or more persons"
"there  must  be  evidence  that  the  formation  of  such  an  assembly.  It  was  her"
"argument that the evidence led in this case has established that the third, fourth"
"and the fifth accused have come to the place of the incident subsequent to the"
"initial attack and therefore it is clear that they have had no common object along"
"with the other accused. It was her position that the charge of unlawful assembly"
"should  therefore  necessarily  fail,  and  as  a  result  the  conviction  based  on"
"unlawful assembly should also fail."
"Replying to the submission of the learned Counsel for the accused, it was the"
"position of the Learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) for the respondent that"
"the main witness, namely PW-01 has given clear evidence to support that there"
"was an unlawful assembly with the participation of the five accused originally"
"named in the indictment."
"It was also his submission that Learned High Court Judge has never shifted the"
"burden of proof to the appellants or has decided that the prosecution has proved"
"the case beyond reasonable doubt before considering defence put forward by the"
"appellants.  It  was  his  position  that  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  has  well"
"considered the relevant facts and the law before reaching his verdict which needs"
"no disturbance from this court."
