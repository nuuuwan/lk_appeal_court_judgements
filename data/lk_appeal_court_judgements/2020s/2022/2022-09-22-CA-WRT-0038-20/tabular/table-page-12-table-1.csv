"on Pensions create no legal right in favour of a Public Servant and that the court have"
"no jurisdiction to entertain an action praying for a declaration in regard to his pension"
"and the date from which he should be paid. I also agree that in Sri Lanka there is no"
"constitution  provision  or  any  other  provision  of  written  law  which  has  the  effect  of"
"altering the provisions of rule1 of the Minutes of Pension."""
"According to the said legal provisions the Petitioner does not have a right to demand to"
"adjust his pension in terms of P9. Under the above stated circumstances, the Petitioner"
"in the instant Application is not entitled to the writs prayed for in the Petition. Therefore,"
"the Court dismiss the writ Application. No costs ordered."
"Application dismissed without costs."
