"The Petitioner  has  failed  to submit  to this  Court, the formal  decision of the Commissioner-"
"General under section 28 of the Agrarian Development Act. We also observe that even during"
"the argument, the Petitioner has failed to meet the strenuous argument of the Respondents that"
"there was no decision under section 28 of the Act by the Commissioner-General, prior to the"
"amendment being effected in the agricultural register marked as P5."
"In the absence of such a decision, the Respondents submitted that the said entry in the register"
"does   not   have   any   legal   validity   or   legitimacy.   They   further   argued   that   under   these"
"circumstances only, the 2nd Respondent had issued a supervision order dated 11.11.2009 (P13)"
"and letters dated 16.09.2009 (P12) and 01.06.2017 (P14) under section 22 of Act No 46 of 2000."
"None of these letters have been challenged by the Petitioner at the relevant time. The Petitioner"
"has failed to explain his failure to reply to the documents P12, P13, P14.and P17 and inform the"
"Commissioner-General that, pursuant to P5, the disputed land is not a paddy land anymore and"
"the same has now been registered as a high land. Especially when the documents mention the"
"land in dispute as “maha kumbura” (“මහ කුඔුර”). Subsequently, the Petitioner has been called"
"for a further inquiry upon a complaint received by 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents."
"The said complaint is marked as R3 and the letter informing the parties of an inquiry pertaining"
"to   the   complaint   is   marked   R2.   The   complaint   which   is   dated   09.10.2017   alleges   that   the"
"Petitioner is illegally filling a paddy filed.  Pertaining to this complaint, the Respondents have"
"called the Petitioner for an inquiry by letter dated 04.12.2017, this letter is marked as P19 which"
"was originally sought to be quashed by the Petitioner. However, on the day of the argument, the"
"Petitioner informed that he is not pursuing the said relief."
"In answering the allegation pertaining to the amendment, the Petitioner contends that why he"
"sought an amendment to change the nature of the land from paddy land to high land, is because it"
"was   impossible   to   cultivate   paddy   in   the   said   land   due   to   the   non-availability   of   irrigation"
"facilities in the said land."
"As   correctly   pointed   out   by   the   Respondents,   and   the   documents   submitted,   this   Court   too"
"observes that the Petitioner’s land is bound by waterways and paddy fields. The Petitioner did"
"not dispute this fact. It is also pertinent to note, that as per the Petitioner’s own letter dated"
"21.09.2017 (R1) Petitioner says that he is unable to cultivate paddy due to the inability of a"
"tractor to reach the paddy field over the waterways.  In this letter, he does not disclose that he"
"cannot cultivate paddy due to lack of water nor has he submitted that in 2003, this land had been"
"made  into a High Land and therefore, he does  not need to cultivate  paddy. Instead,  he had"
"requested the authorities to restore the NIYARA to its original position. The 3rd Respondent has"
"specifically mentioned that the Petitioner has never complained to him pertaining to the lack of"
"irrigation facilities to cultivate paddy. We find that the Petitioner has failed to substantiate his"
"contention of lack of irrigational facilities by submitting any correspondence he had with the 3rd"
"Respondent pertaining to the said issue."
"As observed above, the Petitioner has failed to disclose to this Court, whether he replied to the"
"letters marked as P12 and P13, as by that time, the nature of the land is purported to have been"
"changed. In the absence of an explanation, the conduct of the Petitioner amounts to a suppression"
