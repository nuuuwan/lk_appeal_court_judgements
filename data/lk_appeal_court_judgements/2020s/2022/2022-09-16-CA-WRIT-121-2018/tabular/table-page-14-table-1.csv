"allegation   of   the   Respondents   or   to   produce   the   decision   of   the   commissioner   general.   The"
"Petitioner has failed to explain to this Court the reason for his inability to do so."
"The Respondents also have taken objections as to the truthfulness of this particular affidavit, as"
"the author had affirmed what a 3rd party had said at an inquiry after the lapse of seven years. The"
"purported inquiry had taken place in 2001. Therefore, the Respondents contend that it would be"
"impossible for an ordinary person to accurately give the name with initials of an officer who was"
"purported to have been present to give evidence and the name of the officer who conducted the"
"said inquiry. To substantiate this position the Respondents, bring to our attention the document"
"marked   R5,   which   is   a   report   dated   13.12.2017   by   Y.   A.   N.   Jagath   Kumara,   the   Agrarian"
"Development Officer, and contended that this is the same officer who is supposed to have been"
"present at the inquiry and who is supposed to have stated that there is no objection in changing"
"the paddy land into a High Land."
"Drawing our attention to document R5, the Respondents further contended that as per this R5"
"document, the said Jagath Kumara has said the disputed land had been a paddy land and had"
"been cultivated until the present Petitioner became the owner. Further, he states that from 2001"
"to 2017 he had been collecting acreage taxes for the disputed land on the basis that the said land"
"is a paddy field. In this document, he has never mentioned the purported inquiry that was held in"
"the year 2001. Nor does he state anything about the conversion of the Petitioner’s land nor about"
"an amendment being made to the agricultural land register."
"The Petitioner has failed to explain why he paid acreage taxes to the disputed land on the basis of"
"it being a paddy land if it had been amended to be a high land."
"In these circumstances, it is the contention of the Respondents that if the said Jagath Kumara had"
"taken part in the said inquiry and had submitted about the conversion of the status of the land, he"
"definitely wouldn’t have collected the acreage tax on the basis of the land being a paddy field."
"Further, there was no reason for him not to mention the said conversion in R5."
"The 3rd  Respondent has contended there are no proceedings of an inquiry or decision under"
"section 28 made prior to the amendment affected to P5, and has put the Petitioner in strict proof"
"of the same.  Hence the contention that the Petitioner’s failure to answer this argument amounts"
"to either there being no inquiry, or decision, which would amount to a misrepresentation of facts"
"to this Court or as the Petitioner contends if there was an inquiry by not submitting the said"
"decision of the Commissioner-General, the Petitioner has suppressed material facts to this Court."
"We find the Petitioner has failed to answer this contention."
"The Petitioner does not disclose to this Court why he failed to submit the proceedings of the"
"inquiry   with   the   decision   of   the  Commissioner-General.   The   said   failure   in   the   given"
"circumstances amounts to a misrepresentation and suppression of facts."
"In the case of W. S. Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettictrachchi (1973) 22 NLR 77 it was “Held"
"further, that when an application for a prerogative writ or an injunction is made, it is the duty of"
"the petitioner to place before the Court, before it issues notice in the first instance, a full and"
"truthful disclosure of all the material facts; the petitioner must act with uberrima fides.”"
