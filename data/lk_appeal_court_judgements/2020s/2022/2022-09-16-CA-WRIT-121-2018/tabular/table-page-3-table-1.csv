"The Petitioner purchased a paddy land on 21.02.1999 to the extent of 9A 3R 28P by deed No."
"1486  (P2).  It  is  alleged   that   he  had  found  it   difficult  to   cultivate   paddy  due  to   the  lack  of"
"irrigation facilities.  Petitioner is alleged to have made an application to convert a part of the said"
"paddy land to a High Land and subsequent to an inquiry, the land had been registered as a High"
"Land on 22.10.2003 (P5). Thereafter, Petitioner states that he had been cultivating crops in the"
"said High Land.   He alleges that there had been a misunderstanding between the neighboring"
"farmers   which   has   resulted   in   him   lodging   police   complaints   against   the   said   farmers.   On"
"16.09.2009, the Petitioner received a letter from the 3rd Respondent seeking an explanation for"
"the   failure  to  cultivate  the  land   and  further  alleges   that  the  said  letter   had  been   sent   at  the"
"instigation of the farmers. The Petitioner alleges that the said paddy land is situated in a way that"
"is difficult to cultivate paddy. He further alleges that he had leased the land to another person for"
"the purpose of cultivation and subsequent to the lease expiring had gained possession. Thereafter"
"he alleges that the 2nd Respondent had reactivated the inquiry against him for non-cultivation of"
"paddy in the paddy land and had re-registered the land as paddy land. The Petitioner alleges that"
"the Respondent’s decision to hold an inquiry against the Petitioner for non-cultivation of paddy"
"and   re-registering   the   said   land   as   paddy   land   is   unreasonable,   arbitrary,   and   in   breach   of"
"principles of natural justice. Hence this application for writs of certiorari and mandamus."
