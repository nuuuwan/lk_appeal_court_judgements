"The   Respondents   challenged   the   said   entry   and   the   genuineness   of   this   conversion   on   two"
"grounds, namely that the Petitioner has failed to submit the application where he requested for"
"the change of the nature of the land and the amendment to the agricultural land registry, and that"
"the author of P5 has no legal right to take a decision on deciding whether a land is paddy land or"
"it should be registered as a high land. Thus, the contention that the amendment reflected in the"
"register  is  a  nullity.   At  this  stage,   it  is  also  pertinent   to  note   that   as   per  document  P2,  the"
"Petitioner has purchased this land in 1999. The purported inquiry has been held in January 2001"
"and the purported amendment in the register is dated 22.10.2003 which is nearly 2 ½ years after"
"the purported inquiry."
"The learned Counsel for the Respondent submitted that there exists no documentary evidence in"
"the files maintained pertaining to the application by the Petitioner, to convert the said land.  It"
"was also contended that there are no copies of any proceedings of an inquiry held pursuant to P4,"
"or a decision by the Commissioner-General and argued that the Petitioner has failed to submit"
"the application and the decision because there was no inquiry or a decision."
"However, what is available is only the entry as reflected in P5 where 7 acres of the land has been"
"registered as a High Land the said entry is not made by the Commissioner-General. Therefore,"
"the Respondents contended, that the purported inquiry was a sham and the availability of only"
"two documents submitted to this Court by the Petitioner creates a doubt. Nevertheless, it was"
"argued that in any event, the signatory to the document P5 lacks jurisdiction or legal authority to"
"amend and make an entry without the consent/approval of the Commissioner-General. Further,"
"the   Respondents   submit   that   the   name   and   description   of   the   land   which   appears   in   the"
"agricultural register (P5) and the land described in the schedule of Deed No. 1486 (P2) are"
"different."
"As per section 28 of Act, No 46 of 2000, the sole authority to decide whether a land is paddy"
"land or not is vested with the Commissioner-General. To enable the Commissioner-General to"
"arrive at such a decision, he can call for the observations and information from the Agrarian"
"Development Council. Section 28 (2) reads as follows;"
"“The Commissioner-General may, for the purpose of making a decision under subsection"
"(1), call for and obtain the observations and information from the Agrarian Development"
"Council within whose area of authority the extent of land is situated and from the relevant"
"government departments statutory boards and institutions. It shall be the duty of every"
"such government department, statutory board, and institution to furnish such observations"
"and information as soon as practicable”."
"It is pertinent to note that the Petitioner has submitted the documents calling him for an inquiry"
"and the copy of the agricultural register with the amendment, to prove that there had been an"
"inquiry and the nature of the land in the register had been changed. Also, the Petitioner has"
"tendered an affidavit from a person who is purported to have appeared with the Petitioner at the"
"inquiry   to   establish   the   holding   of   the   inquiry   but   has   failed   to   explain   the   reason   for   not"
"obtaining and submitting to this Court the inquiry proceedings and the formal decision of the"
"Commissioner-General allowing the land to be registered as a highland."
