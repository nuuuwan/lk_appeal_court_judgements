"not empower the said Council on its own to make a decision pertaining to the nature of the land"
"namely to decide whether the land is a paddy land or not."
"We find the Petitioner’s subsequent conduct too doesn’t help his contention of the change of the"
"nature of the land, especially in view of the Petitioner dispatching R1.  The said letter is silent on"
"the   change   in   the   nature   of   the   land   and   the   purported   amendment   to   the   agricultural   land"
"register. The Petitioner has failed to disclose to this Court, as to why he failed to notify this very"
"important fact of change of the nature in the register to the Commissioner-General, which would"
"have solved the need for the inquiry. As stated above he has failed to explain his conduct of not"
"submitting to the Court the said replies to the letters and supervision orders (P12, P13). This"
"Court has to agree with the Respondent’s contention, that the Petitioner has failed to explain to"
"this Court, his failure to challenge the Supervision Order (P13) when it was issued, despite the"
"entry in P5, as his land then would not be subjected to the cultivation of paddy."
"Malice"
"This Court has also considered the Petitioner’s allegation of the Respondent’s alleged acts of"
"malice towards the Petitioner. This allegation was vehemently denied by the Respondents. To"
"demonstrate this allegation, the Petitioner’s main submission was that the Respondents had sent a"
"notice under section 22(2) alleging that the Petitioner has failed to cultivate the land depicted in"
"the schedule (maha kumbura) (P12). It was the contention of the Petitioner, that this notice was a"
"result of malicious complaints made against him by the farmers in the adjoining fields to disrupt"
"his cultivation.  It is pertinent to note, that as per the schedule of the said notice, the Petitioner"
"has   failed   to   cultivate   paddy   not   only   on   the   disputed   7  acres  which   he   alleges   have   been"
"converted into High Land but pertaining to the entirety of the land."
"Even   if   we   are   to   consider   the   Petitioner’s   submission   that   7  acres  of   his   land   have   been"
"converted   into   highland,   still   an   extent   of   2  acres   of   land   is   remaining   as   paddy   land.   The"
"Petitioner has failed to disclose whether he has cultivated paddy in this particular portion or not."
"We find that notice (P14) has been issued pertaining to the entire land consisting of 9A 3R and"
"2P.   As stated above the Petitioner in replying to this notice has failed to bring it to the attention"
"of the author of P14 that by P5, 8 acres of his land has been converted and registered as High"
"Land nor has he replied to explain as to whether he has cultivated paddy in the balance 2 acres"
"portion (P15).  Further, as per document P18, a letter by the Petitioner to the 1st Respondent, he"
"gives an explanation stating that there is no infrastructure to cultivate the land and, in this letter,"
"he has also admitted that even the 2 1/2 acres of paddy land has not been cultivated. None of"
"these letters add strength to the Petitioner’s submission that the land cannot be cultivated with"
"paddy due to lack of water."
"The Petitioner contends that he was informed by the letter dated 04.12.2017 (P19) to be present"
"for an inquiry on 13.12.2017, on the same day he had obtained a copy of the complaint made"
"against him by the 5th Respondent alleging that he was systematically affecting the reclamation"
"of the subject land.  To substantiate his relief of seeking to quash document P19, the Petitioner"
"alleges, that he is afraid of not getting an impartial and fair inquiry and submits that he attempted"
"to walk away from the inquiry. The Petitioner’s reason for this fear is explained by the allegation"
