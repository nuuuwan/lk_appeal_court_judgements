"Although,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  made  submissions on  bias  against  the",""
"learned LT President, what was actually averred in the Petition by the Petitioner is that",""
"those  impugned  orders  had  given  rise  to  both  reasonable  suspicion  of  bias  and  a  real",""
"likelihood of bias on the part of the said learned LT President. I am of the view that the",""
"allegation  of 
judicial  bias  should  be 
inextricably  entwined  with 
the","facts  and 
the"
"circumstances  upon  which  such  allegations  are  being  raised.  Based  on","the  special"
"circumstances of this case and in light of my above findings on issuance of a writ against",""
"the decisions of the LT, I should exercise my discretion not to make a determination on",""
"the allegations of bias against the said learned LT President.",""
"However, I make an observation that parties are entitled to expect that their dispute will",""
"be  heard  by  a  fair  and  an  independent  court  or  tribunal.  The  court/tribunal  should  be",""
"impartial such that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly",""
"be seen to be done. When there are reasonable charges against a judge on bias and unfair",""
"trial, the respective judge is free to get himself recused from hearing the case with a good",""
"grace,  based  on  his  own  opinion.  Anyhow,  it  seems  to  be  that  the  Petitioner  has  not",""
"directly raised any objection before the learned LT President upon bias on the part of the",""
"said President.",""
"For the reasons set forth above, I do not proceed to grant reliefs as prayed for in the prayer",""
"of the Petition of the Petitioner. Application is dismissed.",""
