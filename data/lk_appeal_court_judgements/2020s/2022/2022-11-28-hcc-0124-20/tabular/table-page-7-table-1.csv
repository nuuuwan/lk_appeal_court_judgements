"T
he 3rd count relates to the incident where the father of the victim has come to"
"know about the incident of sexual abuse on 20th November 2014, which should"
"be  considered  as  the  last  incident  of  sexual  abuse.  In  the  indictment,  the"
"incident  has  been  referred  to  as  the  appellant  placing  his  penis  between  the"
"thighs of the victim and engaging in sexual abuse. However, the victim in giving"
"evidence  at  the  trial  has  described  the  last  incident  as  an  incident  where  the"
"appellant performed oral sex on the victim."
"Although one can attribute these discrepancies in the evidence of the victim to"
"the fact that he may have forgotten the minute details of the incident when he"
"gave  evidence  in  Court,  I  find  that  these  are  discrepancies  that  cannot  be"
"ignored  on  such  a  basis  as  the  said  discrepancies  go  to  the  root  of  the"
"prosecution  case.  Therefore,  I  am  in  agreement  with  the  submission  of  the"
"learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  that  although  it  is  not  necessary  to  have"
"corroboration  always  in  sexual  offences  of  this  nature,  this  is  a  case  where"
"corroboration  should  be  looked  into  as  the  evidence  of  the  victim  was  not"
"cogent enough to act on itself."
