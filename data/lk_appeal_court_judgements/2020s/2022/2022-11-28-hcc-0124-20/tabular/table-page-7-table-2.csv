"n  the  case  of  Sunil  and  Another  Vs.  The  Attorney  General  (1986)  1  SLR"
"230, it was held thus:"
"“It  is  very  dangerous  to  act  on  the  uncorroborated  testimony  of  a  woman"
"victim of a sex offence, but if evidence is convincing such evidence could be"
"acted on even in the absence of corroboration."
"Held  further:  Corroboration  is  only  required  or  afforded  if  the  witness"
"requiring corroboration is otherwise credible. If the evidence of the witness"
"requiring  corroboration  is  not  credible  such  testimony  should  be  rejected"
"and the accused acquitted.”"
