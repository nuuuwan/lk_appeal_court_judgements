"expectation  has  been  arisen  for  the  Petitioner  that  he  will  be  allowed  to  retire  with"
"effect from 05.05.2017."
"I
t  is  a  recognized  principle  in  the  administrative  law  that  when  an  expectation  of  a"
"person 
is  going 
to  be  affected,  he 
should  be  given  an  opportunity 
to  make"
"representations  before  his  expectation  is  dashed.  In  the  instant  action,  even  though,"
"the  Petitioner  had  a  legitimate  expectation  that  his  application  to  retire  with  effect"
"from  05.05.2017  will  be  approved,  before  dashing  his  expectation  he  has  not  been"
"given an opportunity to be heard. Therefore, the failure of the Respondents to offer an"
"opportunity to the Petitioner to present his facts before taking the decision mentioned"
"in P-18 is against the principles of Natural Justice namely, audi alteram partem rule."
"T
he  learned  State  Counsel  submitted  to  Court  that  even  though,  the  Petitioner  has"
"sought  a  writ  of  Mandamus  directing  the  1st  to  5th  Respondents  to  pay  him  back-"
"wages and other emoluments including salary increments for the period starting from"
"06.03.2017, his salary had been paid for the period of 06.03.2017 to 04.05.2017 as per"
"R-10.  The 
learned  State  Counsel  argues 
that  non-disclosure  of 
the  fact 
that  he"
"received his salary for that period is a suppression and misrepresentation of a material"
"fact and therefore, the Petitioner is not entitled to a writ of Mandamus directing to pay"
"his  salary  starting  from  06.03.2017  to  the  date  of  reinstatement  which  includes  a"
"period which his salary had been paid. It has been admitted by the Petitioner that his"
"salary  has  been  paid  for  the  period  of  06.03.2017  to  04.05.2017.  Even  though,  by"
"prayer  (d)  the  Petitioner  has  sought  a  writ  of  Mandamus  directing  the  1st  to  5th"
"Respondents to pay his salary for the period commencing from 06.03.2017, by prayer"
"(e)  alternatively  he  has  prayed  for  his  salary  for 
the  period  commencing  from"
