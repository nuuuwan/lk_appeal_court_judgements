"I
t appears that the Provincial High Court of Embilipitiya by Order dated 31.08.2017 dismissed the"
"application of the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant for want of jurisdiction on the basis that the"
"Provincial High Court has no jurisdiction to review matters pertaining to State lands."
"T
he Respondent has relied upon the Supreme Court Judgment in the Case of The Superintendent,"
"Stafford  Estate  and  Others  Vs.  Solaimuthu  Rasu  [(2013)  1  S.L.R  25],  which  held  that  the"
"Provincial High Court has no jurisdiction over the matters related to State lands, as powers relating"
"to State lands have not been devolved to the Provincial Councils by the 13th Amendment to the"
"Constitution. It is seen that the aforesaid case was a matter related to the writ jurisdiction of the"
"Provincial High Court over a decision on a State land."
"I
t  is  seen  that,  the  learned  Judge  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  Embilipitiya  had  obviously"
"followed the Judgment of The Superitendent, Stafford Estate & Two others Vs. Solaimuthu Rasu"
"[supra], which is a writ application. However, as many Judgments and authorities have held, the"
"High Court acting under Article 138 of the Constitution, has jurisdiction to try and hear revision"
"applications relating to State lands."
"I
t is relevant to note that the ratio decidendi of the Judgment in Solaimuthu Rasu’s case, which"
"held that the Provincial High Court, had no jurisdiction to issue writs under Article 154P (4) of the"
"Constitution pertaining to State lands."
"I
n order for the Provincial High Courts to exercise writ jurisdiction, the issue should be one that"
"falls within the purview of the Provincial Council list. Since the subject-State lands does not fall"
"within the purview of the Provincial Council list, Provincial High Court is not empowered to issue"
"writs under Article 154P (4) of the Constitution in respect of matters pertaining to State lands."
"A
ccording  to Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution, which stipulates  that,  “Every such High"
"Court shall notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any Law, exercise appellate and"
"revisionary  jurisdiction  in  respect  of  convictions,  sentences  and  orders  entered  or  imposed  by"
"Magistrate’s Courts and Primary Courts within the province”."
"I
t is noteworthy that revisionary jurisdiction in terms of Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution,"
"has not excluded the power to exercise appellate or revisionary jurisdiction regarding State lands."
