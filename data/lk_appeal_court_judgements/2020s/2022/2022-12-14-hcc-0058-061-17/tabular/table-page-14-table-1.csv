"learned  High  Court  Judge  has  correctly  considered  the  words  that  have  been"
"uttered by the appellants and their actions to come to a firm finding that there"
"was no basis to conclude the offence committed by the appellants amounts to"
"culpable homicide not amounting to murder."
"I do not find any basis to conclude that the learned High Court Judge has failed"
"to consider the dock statements made by the appellants either. In the judgement,"
"the learned High Court Judge has clearly considered the dock statements and"
"determined that the statements do not create a doubt in the prosecution case."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  the  injuries  inflicted  on  the"
"deceased and has considered the evidence placed before the Court  in order to"
"come to a finding that the appellants have acted with the common objective of"
"causing the death of the deceased, for which I have no basis to disagree."
"For  the  reasons  as  considered  above,  I  find  no  merit  in  the  appeals  by  the"
"appellants challenging the 1st and the 3rd count preferred against them for which"
"they were convicted."
"However, the same cannot be said about the conviction of the accused appellants"
"on  the  2nd  count  preferred  against  them.  The  2nd  count  is  related  to  causing"
"injuries  to  PW-01  Gunathilake  Banda  using  a  sharp  cutting  instrument  and"
"thereby  committing  the  offence  of  attempted  murder,  punishable  in  terms  of"
"Section 300 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code."
"The evidence in that regard shows that when PW-01 was assaulted initially, the"
"assault had been physical, where no weapons had been used. According to the"
"evidence of PW-01, the 1st accused has threatened him, pointing a razor knife"
"towards his face and later had caused cut injuries by using the same. The cut"
"injuries had been to the face of PW-01 and the doctor who examined the PW-01"
"has categorized his injuries in terms of Section 311 (f) of the Penal Code, which"
"is causing a permanent disfiguration on the face."
"There was no evidence placed before the Court that the appellants acted with the"
"intention  of  causing  the  death  of  PW-01  in  terms  of  Section  300  of  the  Penal"
