"Agrarian Development seeking advice as to the contemplated legal action (PX28). This was on"
"the basis of the Divisional  Officer’s  Report  which had a finding mentioning  that the illegal"
"construction had been constructed about ten years prior to the inquiry."
"This   Court   finds   it   strange   for   the   Deputy   Commissioner   who   previously   had   instructed   a"
"subordinate officer to act under the Agrarian Development Act No 46 of 2000, to seek advice"
"from the Commissioner-General of agrarian development as to what legal action should be taken."
"It appears to this Court that by this time, the Respondents had been concentrating only on action"
"against the illegal  construction  of the house, that they had completely failed to consider the"
"Petitioners complaint of filling of the pillewa, which also contained the threshing floor."
"This letter has been replied to by the Commissioner-General of agrarian development by the"
"letter dated 05.04.2017 (PX32). Whereby the author had said that, due to the failure to take any"

"reply is received by her pertaining to this letter (P42) then she would consider such failure to"
"reply as a refusal which would result in taking appropriate legal action. The Respondents didn’t"
"contest the receipt of the letter P42."
"At the argument stage, the Petitioner submitted that the Commissioner-General had failed to"
"reply to this letter thus there is an implied refusal to act under the statute."
"The   learned   Counsel   for   the   Respondents   contended   that   the   Respondents   had   taken   action"
"pertaining to the complaint of the Petitioner which is depicted in the documents that have been"
"filed   by  the   Petitioner   herself.   The   learned   Counsel’s   main   contention   was   that   by   the   said"
"correspondence,   the   Respondents   have   acted   within   the   statutory   powers   given   under   the"
