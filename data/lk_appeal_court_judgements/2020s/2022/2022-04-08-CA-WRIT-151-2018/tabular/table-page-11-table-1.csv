"the Petitioner but in this case, we don’t find such a thing has happened. Further, the Petitioners"
"grouse is that the Respondents have failed to pursue the legal action recommended pursuant to"
"their findings. We also find that the Respondents have failed to inform the reasons for their"
"inability to take further steps based on the findings, especially in view of their previous advises"
"which contemplate legal action."
"This takes us to the alternate relief prayed by the Petitioner. This Court will now consider the"
"alternative relief prayed by the Petitioner namely the Respondents to act under section 90(1) of"
"the Act the said section reads as follows.  “Where a complaint is made to the Commissioner-"
"General by any owner cultivator or occupier of agricultural land that any person is interfering"
"with or attempting to interfere with the cultivation rights, threshing rights, rights of using a"
"threshing   floor,   the   right   of   removing   agricultural   produce   or   the   tight   to   the   use   of   an"
"agricultural   road   of   such   owner   cultivator   or   occupier,   the   Commissioner-General   after"
"inquiry may if  he is satisfied that such interference will result in damage or loss of crop or"
"livestock, issue an order on such person cultivator or occupier requiring him to comply with"
"such directions as may be specified in such order necessary for the protection of such rights :"
"Provided that an order under this section shall not be made for the eviction of any person from"
"such agricultural land:"
"Provided further that an order issued under subsection (1) shall not prejudice the right title or"
"interest of such person, cultivator or occupier to such land, crop or livestock in respect of"
"which such order is made”"
"The learned Counsel for the Respondent’s contention was the alternate relief prayed, has to fail"
"as the Petitioner had failed to complain that she is being prevented from using the pillewa or that"
"her cultivation rights have been affected. Thus, the Respondents contended that the Petitioner has"
"failed to trigger the statutory requirements to institute an investigation under section 90(1) of the"
"Act. In considering this objection of the Respondent namely, that there had been no specific"
"complaints pertaining to the obstruction of the cultivating right of the Petitioner, we find that in"
"documents marked as PX8, PX10, there is a reference by the Petitioner drawing the attention of"
"the Respondent to act under section 90(1) of the Act and to preserve her cultivating rights. The"
"Respondent’s contention that the Petitioner has not made a proper complaint to state that her"
"cultivating rights are violated cannot stand ground as in the letters sent by the Petitioner namely"
"in PX10, the Petitioner has specifically complained and sought relief."
"Therefore, in our view with this complaint and other material, the Respondents had sufficient"
"grounds to act under section 90(1) of the Act. This complaint is sufficient for the Respondent to"
"commence an inquiry. Further, it is evident that the letter dated 12.06.2015 (PX9) is a result of"
"this complaint and in the said findings, the divisional officer has come to a conclusion that the"
"Petitioners’ cultivation rights had been affected.   Accordingly, the Petitioner’s contention was"
"that the Respondents should have taken action under section 90 of the Act, has merit."
