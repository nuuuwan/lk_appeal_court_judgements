"Thus, this application for a writ of Mandamus."
"The Petitioner contends that she has got the title for the paddy field and the adjoining pillewa by"
"way of deed marked as PX1A and PX1C. In support of this contention, Petitioner also had"
"annexed a plan marked PX1B dated16.12.2012, where the survey has been carried out on 26th"
"October 2010. In the said plan the pillewa is clearly depicted. The Petitioner’s contention is that"
"the pillewa is an adjacent land to her paddy field which consists of the threshing floor, which"
"under section 101 of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 falls within the definition of"
"paddy land."
"In 2015, three years after the plan was made, the Petitioner has become aware that a 12 ft wide"
"motorable gravel road had been constructed by filling the said pillewa. The Petitioner’s first"
"complaint was that by this particular act, the pillewa has been used for non-agricultural purposes"
"namely, to construct a motorable gravel road. The said gravel road has been constructed to gain"
"access to a house which is alleged to have been constructed by illegally filling an adjoining"
"paddy field to the Petitioner’s land.  Upon getting to know about this construction, the Petitioner"
"has informed the Commissioner-General of The Department of Agrarian Development by her"
"letter dated 06.04.2015 (PX3A) of the same. In the said letter, the Petitioner had stated that since"
"she   was   having   issues   with   her   health,   and   due   to   her   official   duties,   she   was   residing   in"
"Colombo, and as soon as she got to know about this filling of land in the pillewa she made a"
"complaint. In the said letter, she has specifically said that no permission has been sought from"
"her  to  fill  the  pillewa  and  requested  the  agrarian   development  Commissioner  to  institute  an"
"inquiry and to advise the Petitioner on the legal status of filling the pillewa."
"The   Deputy   Commissioner   of   Agrarian   Development   office   Kurunegala   by   letter   dated"
"24.04.2015 had promptly instructed the Divisional Officer to submit a report with observations"
"pertaining to this complaint (PX3B). Subsequently, another letter had been sent by the Assistant"
"Commissioner of Agrarian Development Office (legal) to the Deputy Commissioner of Agrarian"
"Development   office   Kurunegala   dated   20.05.2015   whereby   advice   had   been   given   to   take"
"appropriate action under Act No. 46 of 2000 (PX5) the said letter caption says as follows,"
"“ප(cid:2)ොතුහැර  905  ගම්මන   වසපම්   පිහිටි   ප(cid:18)ොලුප(cid:20)   කුඹුර   පගොඩ   කර   ඉදි   කරන   ල(cid:18)   නිවසකට"
"ඇල්ප න්පිටිය කුඔුරට අනුබද්ධ පිල්ලෑව හරහො වොහන ගොල් කිරීමට හැකි වන බිම් තීරුවකට"
"(cid:2)ොරක් වශපයන් හිමිකම් කීම”"
"However, in paragraph 2 of the said letter, the advice given is to take action pertaining to an"
"illegally filled paddy field. The Agrarian Services Centre had issued notice on the 5th Respondent"
"asking   him   to   attend   an   inquiry   regarding   this   complaint   (PX6).   There   is   no   material   to"
"demonstrate whether the inquiry contemplated in PX6 had commenced or what transpired at the"
"said inquiry. For whatever the reason, a further notice has been sent dated 03.06.2016 asking the"
"5th Respondent to be present for an inquiry (PX7)."
