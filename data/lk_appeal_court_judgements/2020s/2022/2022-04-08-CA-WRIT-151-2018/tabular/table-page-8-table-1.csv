"This Court will consider these objections."
"The learned Counsel also cited the case of  Rathnayake and other v C.D Perera and others"
"(1982) 2 SLR 451 whereby it was held that mandamus would be available when a public officer"
"who is entrusted to perform a public duty had refused to perform. But contended that in this"
"instance the public officers had acted within their powers, pursuant to the Agrarian Development"
"Act."
"It is clear from the documents submitted to this Court especially the correspondence between the"
"parties that no sooner the Petitioner had informed of her grievance and sought advice from the"
"Commissioner-General of agrarian development, the Department of Agrarian Development had"
"sprung into action, and commenced inquiries. But what we observe is that despite the Petitioner"
"informing the provisions of the Act, that had been violated, the Respondents have failed to take"
"steps pursuant to the Act to see a conclusion of the inquiry pursuant to the complaint."
"Learned Counsel also cited Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v Messrs Jafferiee and"
"Jafferjee PVT Ltd (2005) 1 SLR 89 where the Court formulated a test that should be satisfied"
"by a Petitioner when seeking relief by way of writ jurisdiction. There the Courts held;"
"(a) The applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the parties against"
"whom   the   mandamus   is   sought   (R   v   Barnstaple   Justices   exp.   Carder.   The   foundation   of"
"mandamus is the existence of a legal right (Napier ex parte)"
"(b) The right to be enforced must be a “Public Right” and the duty sought to be enforced must"
"be of a public nature."
"(c) The legal right to compel must reside in the applicant himself (R v Lewisham Union)"
"(d) The application must be made in good faith and not for an indirect purpose”"
"This Court finds that in this instance, the Petitioner who is the aggrieved owner cultivator has a"
"legal right to seek redress from 1st  - 4th  Respondents against an illegal filling of a pillewa if it"
"violates the provisions of the Act. The answer to this question is available on the findings of the"
"several inquiries that had been conducted by the Respondents themselves. One such finding as"
"reflected in PX9 is that there is an illegal construction of a house and illegal filling of the pillewa"
"which   is   obstructing   the   cultivating   rights   of   the   Petitioner.   The   Commissioner-General   of"
"Agrarian Development has instructed the Deputy Commissioner to institute action (PX26). Thus,"
"by the conduct of the Respondents themselves, it is evident that the duty that is sought to be"
"enforced is a statutory duty under the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000."
"The Petitioner is seeking a legal right that has been accepted by the agrarian development officer"
"who had conducted several inquiries pertaining to this issue and concluded that the pillewa has"
"been   illegally   filled,   thereby   it   is   apparent   that   the   Petitioner’s   cultivation   rights   have   been"
