"Even in the presence of a constitutional ouster as per in Article 61A, Shiranee Tilakawardane"
"J. (P/CA) has taken the view in Katugampola case that the Writ jurisdiction could be sought"
"under circumstances where the person who made the impugned decision did not have any"
"legal authority to make such a decision. ‘In that sense it is not reasonable for any public power,"
"even  in  the  presence  of  a  Constitutional  preclusive  clause,  to  get  drifted  without  being"
"reviewed, when required, by an appropriate Court of law at some stage during the process.’"
"(See-the  order  of  this  Court-Mohamed  Ismail  Wahabdeen  vs.  His  Lordship  Justice  Jayantha"
"Jayasuriya-Hon. Chief Justice and others, CA/WRIT/468/2021 decided on 08.08.2022)."
"In the circumstances, I am of the view that the statutory ouster mentioned in section 29D of"
"the Act cannot be used to undermine the judicial control of this Court against decision or a"
"determination  made  under  the  said  Act,  if  it  is  ex-facie  apparent  that  such  act  or  decision"
"comes under any of the ground of judicial review.  It cannot be assumed that the Board of"
"Directors of the Bank has an unfettered discretion under the said Act to take decisions without"
"proper  legal  authority  and  depriving  access  to  justice  through  an  application  for  a  writ."
"Anyhow, I agree to a great extent that the said statutory ouster contained in Section 29D of"
"the Act would be applicable to related actions filed in the District Court."
"Contractual Relationship – availability of Writs."
"The other main argument of the 1st Respondent is that the relationship between the Petitioner"
"and the Bank was purely contractual as the Petitioner is the ‘Debtor’ and the 1st Respondent"
"is the ‘Creditor’. The 1st Respondent contends that the Courts have consistently held in the"
"below mentioned cases that where the relationship between the parties was contractual, the"
"remedy by way of writ jurisdiction will not be available;"
