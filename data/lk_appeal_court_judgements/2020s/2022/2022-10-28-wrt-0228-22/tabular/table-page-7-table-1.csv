"Mark Fernando J. in agreement with Dheeraratne J. Wadugodapitiya J. in Atapattu and others"
"vs. People's Bank and others (1997) 1 Sri. L.R. 208. The Supreme Court held in that case;"
"“There is an apparent conflict between the ouster clause (which is pre-Constitution legislation),"
"and Article 140. While generally a Constitutional provision, being the higher norm, must prevail"
"over statutory provision, there are some constitutional provisions which enable pre-Constitution"
"written law to continue to apply. The first is Article 16(1), which is inapplicable here, because"
"that deals only with inconsistency with fundamental rights. The second is Article 168(1), which"
"provides: 'Unless Parliament otherwise provides, all laws, written laws and unwritten laws, in"
"force  immediately  before  the  Constitution,  shall,  mutatls  mutandis,  and  except  as  otherwise"
"expressly provided in the Constitution, continue in force."" However, this would make the ouster"
"clause  operative  only  “except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided""  in  Article  140.”  (Emphasis"
"added)"
"“But there is one difference between those Articles and Article 140. Article 140 (unlike Article"
"126) is “subject to the provisions of the Constitution”. Is that enough to reverse the position, so as"
"to make article 140 subject to the written laws which Article 168(1) keeps in force? Apart from"
"any other consideration, if it became necessary to decide which was to prevail - an ouster clause"
"in an ordinary law or a Constitutional provision conferring writ jurisdiction on a Superior Court,"
"""subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution”  -  I  would  unhesitatingly  hold  that  the  latter"
"prevails, because the presumption must always be in favour of a jurisdiction which enhances"
"the protection of the Rule of Law, and against an ouster clause which tends to undermine it"
"(see also Jailabdeen v. Danina Umma (1962) 64 N.L.R. 419, 422). But no such presumption is"
"needed,  because  it  is  clear  that  the  phrase  ""subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution”  was"
"necessary to avoid conflicts between Article 140 and other Constitutional provisions  -  such as"
"Article 80(3), 120, 124, 125, and 126(3), That phrase refers only to contrary provisions in the"
"Constitution itself, and does not extend to provisions of other written laws, which are kept alive"
"by Article 168(1), Where the Constitution contemplated that its provisions may be restricted by"
"the provisions of Article 138 which is subject to “any law”."
"“There  is  another  reason  why  this  particular  ouster  clause  is  of  no  avail  in  these  appeals.  It"
"purports to protect from review only a determination by the Bank whether any premises should"
