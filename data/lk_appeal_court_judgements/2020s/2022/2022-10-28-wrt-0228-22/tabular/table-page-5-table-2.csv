"It is observed that the said case of People’s Bank vs. Hewawasm is also an application to revise"
"the order of the learned District judge of Colombo. The case of Meragala vs. People’s Bank and"
"others was a writ application by which the writ jurisdiction has been invoked and the Court of"
"Appeal has taken a similar view as in the said Hewawasam case and has held that the validity"
"and/or legality of a resolution cannot be questioned. The Court has not examined the power"
"of the Court of Appeal under Article 140 of the Constitution in the said case. The Supreme"
"Court in People’s Bank and seven others vs Yasasiri Kasthuriarachchi (a case relied on by the 1st"
"Respondent) has not directly examined the effect of Section 29D of the  People’s Bank Act"

"‘if it is ex facie apparent on the application that the body or Authority who made the direction"
"or  order  had  acted  ultra  vires  the  powers  that  had  been  conferred  upon  such  body  or  was"
"acting contrary to rules of natural justice or had not complied with the mandatory provisions"
"of law’."
"The Petitioner heavily relied on Harjani and another vs. Indian Overseas Bank and others (2005)"
"1  Sri.  L.R.  167  by  which  the  Indian  Overseas  Bank  has  sought  to  take  advantage  of  the"
"provisions of the Recovery of Loans by Bank (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990 relating"
"to  parate  execution.  Saleem  Marsoof  P.C.  J.  (P/CA)  (as  he  then  was)  in  the  said  case,"
"observing the fact that the powers in regard to parate execution have been conferred by Statute"
