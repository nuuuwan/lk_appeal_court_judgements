"occasions  have  been  granted  to  the  Petitioners  by  the  Bank.  Thus,  I  agree  with  the  1st"
"Respondent’s contention that those Circulars will have no bearing in determining the instant"
"application. Anyhow, there is no evidence tendered at all by the Petitioner for this Court to"
"deliberate whether the Petitioner was subject to COVID-19 moratorium which is one of the"
"main preconditions of such circulars."
"Conclusion."
"As  mentioned  earlier  in  this  judgement,  the  Petitioner  seeks  only  for a  writ  of  Prohibition"
"restraining the 1st and 2nd Respondents from taking steps to auction the subject property. The"
"Petitioner to become successful in his plea in the instant application should reveal that the"
"execution of the decision taken by those Respondents to auction the property  exceed their"
"jurisdiction. Similarly, it is required to demonstrate that such decision should be irrational,"
"guilty of illegality or vitiated by the principles of Natural Justice."
"In light of my findings in this judgement, I take the view that the Petitioner, prima facie, has"
"failed to establish that it is entitled for a writ of Prohibition as prayed for in the prayer of the"
"Petition."
"For the reasons set out above, I am not inclined to accept the contentions of the Petitioner"
"that the two agreements contained in ‘P3’ and ‘P6’ are distinct loans and that in the case of"
"default  there  must  be  separate  Resolutions;  and  as  such  the  1st  Respondent  Bank  cannot"
"enforce the said Resolution in terms of Clause 6.9 of ‘P6’ for the reasons that it is contrary to"
"Section 29D and Section 29K of the Act."
"As per the crucial document ‘P6’ or the agreement, marked ‘X12’, in which the Petitioner has"
"waived his rights by conceding for the Respondents to proceed with the auction based on the"
"same  Resolution,  marked  ‘P5’.  The  Petitioner  has  not  challenged  the  authenticity  of  both"
"documents  and  also  has  not  denied  his  signature  etc.,  at  any  point  of  time.  However,  the"
"Petitioner has failed to establish illegality to render the above agreements null and void. When"
"analyzing the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioners, the Petitioner's conduct, particularly the"
"acquiescence during the recovery process should be taken into consideration."
