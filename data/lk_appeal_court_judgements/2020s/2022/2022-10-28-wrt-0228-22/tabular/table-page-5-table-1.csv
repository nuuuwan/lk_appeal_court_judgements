"“The above expression in Section 29(D) is of similar import as “shall not be called in question in"
"any Court”, contained in Section 22 of the Interpretation Ordinance. Hence, we agree with the"
"submissions made by the learned President’s Counsel on behalf of the Defendant-Petitioner that"
"the said resolution (marked E) passed by the Board of Directors of the People’s Bank, cannot be"
"invalidated or challenged in an action in the District Court. Therefore, in these circumstances,"
"the sale of the mortgaged property by public auction upon the said resolution marked E cannot"
"be restrained by an interim injunction.”"
