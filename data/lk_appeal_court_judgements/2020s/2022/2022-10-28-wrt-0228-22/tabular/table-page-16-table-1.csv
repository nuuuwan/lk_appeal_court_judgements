"In Jayaweera vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and Another (1996) 2"
"Sri. L.R. 70, in which F.N.D. Jayasuriya J. held;"
"""A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of certiorari is not"
"entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is"
"entitled to relief, still the Court has a discretion to deny him having regard to his conduct, delay,"
"laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction- are all valid impediments which stand against the"
"grant of relief"""
