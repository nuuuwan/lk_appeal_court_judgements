"When reading Section 31 of the Partition Act No.21 of 1977 as amended by Act No.17 of 1997, it"
"is clear that the court cannot allocate a portion of land less than the minimum extent required by"
"law regarding the sub-division of lands for development purposes. It is clear that if the Appellant's"
"request is complied with, it will leave a portion to Plaintiff, which will be against the provisions"
"discussed above. If 2.89 perches of Lot No.21B of the final Plan of G.M. Gunadasa is given to the"
"Appellant as prayed by him, it will leave only 3.2 perches to the Plaintiff, which is against the"
"requirement for development purposes."
"Therefore, it is clear that the Appellant's request cannot be granted according to the requirement"
"of the written law, which requires a minimum of six perches."
"Another important fact is that the Appellant had not invoked the proper jurisdiction from this court."
"The  Partition  Law  is  a  special  law  which  had  provided  for  appeals  regarding  inquiries  under"
"Section 36 of the Partition Act No.21 of 1977 as amended  Section 36A of the Partition Law reads"
"as ""Any person dissatisfied with an order of court made under Section 36 may prefer an appeal"
"against such an order with the leave of the Court of Appeal first had and obtained."""
"The position was discussed in  Munidasa Vs. Nandasena1. Therefore, it is settled law that since"
"partition  law  provides  a  specific  remedy,  the  Appellant  is  not  entitled  to  seek  remedies  under"
"Sections of the Civil Procedure Code. The Appellant had filed this case under Section 754(2) of"
"the Civil Procedure Code. Therefore, this court is not empowered to grant remedies prayed for by"
"the Appellant."
"Sri Lankan courts held that law does not help lashers of parties many times. For over six years"
"after granting leave to proceed, the Appellant had failed to make the essential party, namely the"
"Substituted Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent, a party. The delay in finalizing the case was entirely"
"on the shoulder of the Appellant. Even if one considers that sections of the Civil Procedure Code"
"apply, bringing the necessary parties to court is essential. It becomes more severe when applied to"
"Partition Law. Since the judgment of a partition action is in rem, all necessary parties must be"
"named."
