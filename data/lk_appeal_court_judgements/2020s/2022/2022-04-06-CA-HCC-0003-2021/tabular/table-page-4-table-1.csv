"point, the approach to sentencing should be individualistic"
"and  focused  on  the  child  or  young  person,  as  opposed  to"
"offence focused. For a child or young person the sentence"
"should 
focus  on  rehabilitation  where  possible.  A  court"
"should  also  consider  the  effect  the  sentence  is  likely  to"

"negative) as well as any underlying factors contributing to"

"impact on their decision making and risk taking behaviour."
"It is important to consider the extent to which the child or"
"young  person  has  been  acting  impulsively  and  whether"
"their conduct has been affected by inexperience, emotional"
"volatility  or  negative 
influences.  They  may  not 
fully"
"appreciate the effect their actions can have on other people"
"and may not be capable of fully understanding the distress"
"and pain they cause to the victims of their crimes. Children"
"and young people are also likely to be susceptible to peer"

lead 
to  experimentation,"
"resulting in criminal behaviour. When considering a child"
"or young person’s age their emotional and developmental"
"age is of at least equal importance to their Chronological"
"age (if not greater).”"
