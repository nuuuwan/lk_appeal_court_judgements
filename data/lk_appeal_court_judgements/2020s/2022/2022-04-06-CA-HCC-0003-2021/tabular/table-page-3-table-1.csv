"was 16 years old when he committed the offence. Further, it was"
"submitted 
that 
the  appellant  has  no  previous  convictions  and"
"therefore  the  custodial  sentence  of  7  years  is  not  proportionate"
"with  the  sexual  act  that  was  performed  by  the  appellant  on  the"
"victim."
"4.  The  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG)  for  the  respondent"
"submitted that the child victim who was 10 years old at the time of"
"the  incident  has  been  mentally  subnormal.  It  is  the contention  of"
"the  learned  DSG  that  the  punishment  should  deter  the  bullies  in"
"schools  who  commit  such  offences  on  school  children  who  are"
"vulnerable. Apart from the physical act and the injuries, the mental"
"trauma that would affect the child victim also has to be taken into"
"consideration  when 
imposing 
the  punishment  on 
the  offender,"
"therefore, 
the  7  year 
imprisonment 
sentence 
is 
justified, 
the"
"learned DSG submitted."
"5.  The prescribed sentence for the offence of grave sexual abuse, in"
"terms of section 365(b) 2(b) is, rigorous imprisonment for a term"
"not less than 7 years and not exceeding 20 years and with fine and"
"also compensation of an amount determined by Court."
"6.  When  sentencing  an  offender,  Court  will  take  into  account  the"
"prescribed  sentence  by  law  with  the  gravity  of  the  offence,  the"
"aggravating  factors  and 
the  mitigatory  factors.  A  considerable"
"discount  will  be  given  to  an  offender  for  an  early  guilty  plea"
"especially  on  sexual  offenders  who  are  remorseful  and  prevent"
"further trauma on the victims caused by giving evidence in Court."
"In the instant case, the appellant is not entitled to such discount."
"7.  The main mitigatory factor in this case in favour of the appellant is"
"that  he  was  a  juvenile  of  16  years  old  when  he  committed  the"
"offence on the victim who was also a child. Thus, it is important to"
"take note as to how Courts have dealt with juvenile offenders."
"8.  Courts  quite  often  tend  to  sentence  juvenile  offenders  with  non-"
"custodial sentences. Even if a custodial sentence is imposed on a"
"juvenile,  usually  it  will  be  lesser  than  that  imposed  on  an  adult"
"offender."
"9.  This 
issue  has  been  discussed  at 
length 
in  Archbold  2019"
"sentencing Guidelines."
