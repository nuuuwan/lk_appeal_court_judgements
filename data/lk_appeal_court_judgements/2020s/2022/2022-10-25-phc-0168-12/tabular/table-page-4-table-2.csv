"reported in [1982] 2 SLR 693;"
"â€œThat person is entitled to possession until he is evicted by due process of law. A"
"Judge  should  therefore  in  an  inquiry  under Part  VII  of  the  aforesaid  Act,  confine"
"himself to the question of actual possession on the date of filing of the information"
"except in a case where a person who had been in possession of the land had been"
"dispossessed  within  a  period  of  two  months  immediately  before  the  date  of  the"
"information. He is not to decide any question of title or right to possession of the"
"parties  to  the  land.  Evidence  bearing  on  title  can  be  considered  only  when  the"
"evidence  as  to  possession  is  clearly  balanced  and  the  presumption  of  possession"
"which  flows  from  title  may  tilt  the  balance  in  favour  of  the  owner  and  help  in"
"deciding the question of possession."
