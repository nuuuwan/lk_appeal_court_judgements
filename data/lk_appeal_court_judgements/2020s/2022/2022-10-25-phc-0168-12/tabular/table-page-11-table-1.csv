"Judge has not considered that this is a road maintained by the Pradeshiya Sabhawa for the"
"public."
"I
n view of the aforementioned reasons, it is relevant to note that the High Court has erred"
"in  law  by  not  appreciating  the  legal  position  regarding  extinction  of  servitudes.  The"
"evidence  has  shown  that  the  road  concerned  was  a  public  road  maintained  by  the"
"Pradeshiya Sabhawa for the villagers which villagers had used and vehicles went over this"
"path over a long period of time except for a limited period. Moreover, the wall put up by"
"the temple was shown as illegal as per the correspondence from the Pradeshiya Sabhawa"
"by letters marked as 1ව1, 1ව2, 1ව3 and 1ව5."
"I
t is seen that the learned Magistrate had correctly applied the relevant law to the facts of"
"the case and had come to a correct finding based on the evidence placed before Court."
"Moreover, it is evident that the road has been used for over 10 years and was maintained"
"by the Pradeshiya Sabhawa. The High Court has accepted that the impugned road was used"
"by the villagers. However, the High Court has erroneously held that Appellant has lost the"
"servitudanal rights on the basis that there was a waiver of the right by not having used it"
"for over 1 year."
"M
oreover,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  failed  to  appreciate  that  this  is  a  public"
"roadway  maintained  by  the  Pradeshiya  Sabhawa  for  the  villagers.  The  documentary"
"evidence submitted by the Appellant and the Intervenient parties have substantiated that"
"the  impugned  road  is  maintained  by  the  Pradeshiya  Sabhawa  and  it  is  not  the  private"
"property of the temple. The 1st Respondent had not substantiated that the disputed road"
"was owned by the temple or that the temple was given exclusive right to use the impugned"
"road."
"I
n such circumstances, the Court has to consider  whether the parties are entitled to use"
"the  disputed  roadway  as  emphasized  by  Justice  Salam  in  the  case  of  Ananda  Sarath"
"Paranagama Vs. Dhammadinna Sarath Paranagama and Kamitha Aswin Paranagama"
