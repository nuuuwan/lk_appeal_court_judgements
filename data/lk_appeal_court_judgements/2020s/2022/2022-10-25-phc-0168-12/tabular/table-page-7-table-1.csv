"the  breach  of  the  peace  among  parties  until  the  competent  civil  jurisdiction  solves  the"
"matter in dispute."
"I
t  is  worthy  to  note  that  the  complaint  made  by  the  2nd  Party-Respondent  falls  within"
"Section 69(1) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act which reads as follows;"
"“Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or any part of a land other than"
"the right to possession of such land of part thereof, the Judge of the Primary Court"
"shall determine as to who is entitled to the right which is the subject of the dispute"
"and make an order under subsection 2.”"
"S
ection 75 of the Act defines a ‘dispute affecting land’ as follows;"
"“In  this  Part  ‘dispute  affecting  land’  includes  any  dispute  as  to  the  right  to  the"
"possession of any land or part of a land and the buildings thereon or the boundaries"
"there- of or as to the right to cultivate any land or part of a land, or as to the right"
"to the crops or produce of any land, or part of a land, or as to any right in the nature"
"of a servitude affecting the land and any reference to ‘land’ in this Part includes a"
"reference to any building standing thereon.”"
"T
hus, in this case, what is required to be established by the 2nd Party-Respondent is not"
"that he has a servitude but only that he is entitled to a right which is in the nature of a"
"servitude."
"S
ection 69(2) sets out power of the Primary Court Judge when inquiring into a complaint"
"under Section 69(1)."
"“An order under this subsection may declare that any person specified therein shall"
"be entitled to any such right in or respecting the land or in any part of the land as"
"may be specified in the order until such person is deprived of such right by virtue of"
"an order or decree of a competent court, and prohibit all disturbance or interference"
"with the exercise of such right by such party other than under the authority of an"
"order or decree as aforesaid.”"
