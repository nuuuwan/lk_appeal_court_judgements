"therein is not a material allegation in the sense of that expression as it occurs in"

"The learned District Judge has observed that the rights of Siriwardane which he"
"had inherited will not be affected as they are not included into the inventory."
"The  entirety  of  rights 
in 
‘Hathepmewatte’  has  not  been 
included 
in  the"
"inventory. In any event an undivided right of a third party will not get wiped out"
"because of the fact that they were not excluded from the inventory. The purpose"
"of this Testamentary action is to administer the estate of the deceased testator"
"and this is not a case to decide the undivided rights of properties owned by him."
"The learned District Judge has correctly observed that."
"The 10th Respondent says that the bakery standing on “Hathepmewatte” was"

in  the 
inventory  the  movables  and  goods  for"
"sale/stocks  in  the  business  premises  in  the  name  of  Manoranjanee.  The  10th"
"Respondent  had  stated  that  her 
late  husband  Siriwardane  was  doing  the"
"business named මබනෝරංජනි and she had sought for an exclusion of the business"
