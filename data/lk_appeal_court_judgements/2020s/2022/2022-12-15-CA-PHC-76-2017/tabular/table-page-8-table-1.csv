"contention  of  not  possessing  knowledge  has  no  bearing  in  dispensing  the  said"
"burden as positive actions on the part of the vehicle owner are necessitated."
"However,  the  appellant,  despite  her  petition,  has  not  taken  any  precautionary"
"measures,  there  is  no  evidence  revealed  in  her  evidence  before  the  Magistrate"
"Court to affirm that the appellant had taken any measures to be precautious with"
"the  employment  of  her  vehicle.  The  mere  fact  that  she  did  not  possess  the"
"knowledge of the commission of such an offence does not satisfy the said burden."
"Hence this Court is of the view that the appellant has not adequately dispensed"
"on a balance of probability the burden cast upon her by Section 40 of the Act."
"For the above reasons, it is considered the view of this Court, since the appellant"
"has failed to dispense the burden cast on her, that the learned Magistrate has"
"duly  concluded  the  matter  at  hand  and  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"correctly  dismissed  the  revision  application.  Accordingly,  we  see  no  reason  to"
"interfere with the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 27.06.2017 and"
"the confiscation order of the learned Magistrate dated 08.12.2015. Therefore, this"
"Court affirms the same."
"The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs."
