"Katugasthota  and  another,  CA(PHC)  111/2018,  Minute  dated  01.11.2022,"
"where it was held that:"
"“It is plainly clear in law that a claimant of a vehicle inquiry under the Forest"
"Ordinance has to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that he/she, having"
"ownership of the vehicle concerned, had taken all precautions to prevent the"
"use of such vehicle for the commission of the offence. By the amendment to"
"the  Forest  Ordinance  in  2009  by  Act  No.  65  of  2009,  the  legislature  has"
"determined  that  having  no  knowledge  of  the  offence  being  committed  is  a"
"not good enough  a  reason anymore  to claim a confiscated vehicle  […] The"
"judiciary has to only discern  whether  the  claimant being the owner of the"
"vehicle, had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the"
"commission  of  the  offence.  This  entails  positive  actions  on  the  part  of  the"
"owner and not claiming mere ignorance. (Emphasis added)"
