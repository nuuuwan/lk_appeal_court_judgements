"does not directly say that she is  a Kandyan. Therefore, that question will not"
"arise. In any event there is no evidence of a customary marriage. The Divisional"
"Secretary Katana who had inquired into this matter had stated in the document"
"marked  P15  that  the  Petitioner  had  not  contracted  a  lawful  marriage  or  a"
"customary marriage subsequently. By the word lawful (නීත්‍යනුකූල), what he had"
"meant is a marriage registered under one of the two marriage Ordinances. There"
"is no evidence to show that the Petitioner was living together with the father of"
"her illegitimate son as husband and wife. The extracts of the electoral register"
"marked  P21A  to  P21F  shows  that  the  only  male  who  was  living  in  the  house"
"where 
the  Petitioner  resided  was 
the  Petitioner’s 
father.  Therefore, 
the"
"presumption of a marriage by habit and repute will not arise. Therefore, there"
"was no evidence before the 2nd Respondent and the other authorities to come"
"to  the  conclusion  that  the  Petitioner  had  ‘remarried’  within  the  meaning  of"
"section  7  of  the  Circular  No.  13/2010  marked  P25.  According  to  the  literal"
"interpretation what is meant by the word ‘remarried’ in that section is a lawful"
"marriage, a marriage recognized by law. A person who had given birth to a child"
"as a result of an association with a man who is not his lawful husband does not"
"come within the definition of a person who had remarried. In the case of the"
"Writ  Application  No.  442/2015  decided  by  this  Court  on  16.05.2018,  in  an"
"identical situation Samayawardena J. had observed as follows,"
"“This decision regarding the question of contracting a valid marriage has been"
"taken not by a Court of Law but by certain individuals sitting alone in their official"
"capacities.”"
"The pension Circular No. 13/2010 is not a mere circular but a direction given to"
"all the secretaries to the ministries, heads of departments, district secretaries,"
"divisional secretaries and the commanders of the three armed forces regarding"
"the 
implementation  of 
the  amendments 
to 
the  Widows/Widowers’  and"
"Orphans’ Pension Act. Therefore, what is contained in that document are the"
"amendments made to the Pension Act. Therefore, the section 7 of that circular"
"has  the  force  of  a  statute.  The  Respondents  have  not  disputed  this  position."
"Therefore the 2nd Respondent is bound by section 7 of that circular which is in"
"fact a regulation made under the Act which has the force of a statute."
"For  the  reasons  I  have  sated  before  there  was  no  material  before  the  2nd"
"Respondent to come to a conclusion that the Petitioner had ‘remarried’ within"
