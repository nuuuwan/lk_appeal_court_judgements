"exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to"
"consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is said,"
"to be acting ‘unreasonably’. Similarly, there may be something so absurd that no"
"sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority."
"Warrington LJ in Short v. Poole Corporation gave the example of the red-haired"
"teacher, dismissed because she had red hair. This is unreasonable in one sense."
"In  another 
it 
is 
taking 
into 
consideration  extraneous  matters. 
It 
is 
so"
"unreasonable that it might almost be described as being in bad faith; and, in fact,"
"all these things run into one another.”"
"As  I  have  observed  earlier  the  2nd  Respondent  in  arriving  at  his  decision  had"
"taken 
into  consideration 
irrelevant  matters  such  as  social  and  economic"
"background of the Petitioner which enable her to seek legal assistance and the"
"poverty of the ordinary citizens who are unable of getting the protection of the"
"law.  Therefore,  the  2nd  Respondent  had  not  excluded  from  his  mind  matters"
"which  are irrelevant to  what he  has  to consider  and not  followed  the course"
"which  reasons  directs.  Therefore, 
the  decision  of 
the  2nd  Respondent 
is"
"unreasonable which no reasonable authority could have come. Therefore, the"
"decision becomes unlawful."
"De Smith, Woolf and Jowell in their treatise Judicial Review of Administrative"
"Action  5th  edition  at  page  229  observes  thus,  “Acting  ultra  vires,  and  acting"
"without jurisdiction have essentially the same meaning, although in general the"
"term ‘vires’ has been employed when considering administrative decisions and"
"subordinate 
legislative  orders,  and 
‘jurisdiction’  when  considering 
judicial"
"decisions, or those having judicial flavour”"
"Dr. Ranjith Ranaraja J. in the case of Surveyors Institute of Sri Lanka vs. Acting"
"Surveyor General 1998 1 SLR 266 had stated as follows,"
"“An administrative act or order which is ultra vires or outside jurisdiction is void"
"in law, ie., deprived of legal effect. This is because an order to be valid it [sic]"
"needs statutory authorisation, and if it is not within the powers given by the Act,"
"it has no leg to stand on…..”"
"For  the  aforesaid  reasons  we  are  of  the  view  that  the  decision  of  the  2nd"
"Respondent is  contrary to the provisions of the Pensions Act and against the"
"literal  interpretation  that  can  be  given  to  section  7  of  the  aforementioned"
