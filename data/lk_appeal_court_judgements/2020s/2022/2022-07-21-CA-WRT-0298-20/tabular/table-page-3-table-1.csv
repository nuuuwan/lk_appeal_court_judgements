"T
he  Petitioner  states  that  he  had  given 
leave  and 
license  to  one  S."
"Halaldeen  (father  of  the  3rd  Respondent)  to  carry  out  a  beef  stall  on  a"
"portion of lot No.181 which is identified as lot No. 29 in plan marked P10,"
"that is the land in dispute."
"The  Petitioner  further  states  that  on  the  demise  of  said  S.Halaldeen  in"
"1997,  he  did  not  extend 
the 
leave  and 
license 
to  his  son, 
the  3rd"
"Respondent. The  Petitioner  contends 
that  on 
the  basis  of 
legitimate"
"expectation he is entitled to obtain a Grant/Permit to the balance portion"
"of Lot No. 181, namely Lot No. 29 in plan P10 as he had  already paid a"
"sum of Rs. 3138.35 for the entirety of Lot No. 181. Since the 1st and 2nd"
"Respondents failed to issue a Permit/Grant to the Petitioner pertaining to"
"the subject matter (lot No. 29 in plan P10) he seeks a Writ of Mandamus"
"as prayed for in the prayers to the Petition."
"A
dmittedly,  lot  No.  28  in  plan  No.  P10  was  granted  to  the  Petitioner  in"
"1999. The Petitioner has filed the instant Application before this Court in"
"2020, after nearly 20 years. Moreover, it is borne out from the plan marked"
"as P10, the lot No.181 had been subdivided  into two lots in 1985. If the"
"Petitioner has a legitimate expectation to obtain lot No. 29 as well, he need"
"not  wait  for  such  a  long  period  to  come  before  Court.  Thus,  it  is  an"
"undisputed fact that there is a long delay on the part of the Petitioner in"
"invoking the Writ  jurisdiction of this  Court. In this regard, I refer to the"
"observation made by the Supreme Court in the case of D.D. Kaluarachchi"
"Vs.  Ceylon  Petroleum  Corporation 
(SC.  Appeal  No.  43/2013,  SC"
"Minute  dated  19-06-2019).  This  is  the  case  where  five  years  after  the"
"retirement,  four  former  employees  of  the  Ceylon  Petroleum  Corporation"
"filed a writ of application before the Court of Appeal and moved Court for"
"Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus in respect of certain salary arrears. The"
"Court  of  Appeal 
issued  a  Writ  of  Mandamus  directing  the      Ceylon"
"Petroleum Corporation to pay the Petitioners certain salary arrears. Murdu"
"Ferdnando,  J.  agreeing  with  Sisira  de  Abrew  and  Vijith  Malalgoda  JJ.,"
"observed that;"
"“
……I am inclined to accept the contention of the Appellants that the Court"
"of Appeal should have dismissed this application in-limine on the ground of"
"laches which was a threshold issue. The Court of Appeal did not consider"
"the ground of laches, which was raised as a preliminary objection. I observe"
"this omission as a grave error in the Court of Appeal Judgment….”"
