"With the above legal principles in mind, I will now proceed to consider whether"
"the prosecution had been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the four"
"appellants were members of an unlawful assembly, where the deceased and the"
"PW-01 were shot at."
"As agreed, rightly by the learned SDSG, in order to prove this fact, it is necessary"
"to  consider  whether  the  evidence  of  the  two  eyewitnesses  was  cogent  and"
"credible. According to the evidence, it should be the PW-01 who has first seen"
"the assailants approaching him. He speaks only about the 4th accused whom he"
"has identified as Christopher and a person called Kiki. According to his evidence,"
"they have been waiting near the bus stand in front of the Sugathadsa Stadium"
"before the person whom he identified as Christopher open fire at them. According"
"to  his  evidence,  Christopher  is  a  person  well-known  to  him.  Although  he  has"
"spoken about the person called Kiki standing along with the Christopher at the"
"bus stand, he has not been specific as to the role played by the mentioned Kiki"
"when he was first fired at. He speaks about two persons coming after him and"
"the deceased and firing again after they fell from the motorbike, he has failed to"
"identify the said persons as Christopher and Kiki. The mentioned Christopher is"
"the 4th appellant."
"PW-02  who  was  the  other  eye  witness  to  the  incident  was  riding  the  2nd"
"motorbike  behind  the  motorbike  ridden  by  PW-01.  According  to  his  evidence,"
"when  they  were  passing  the  bus  stand  in  front  of  the  Sugathadasa  Stadium,"
"around  five  persons  jumped  onto  the  road  and  started  firing  indiscriminately"
"towards PW-01 and the deceased. He has been specific that he was 5-6 meters"
"behind the motorbike of PW-01when the incident occurred. He has started in his"
"evidence that it was a person wearing a chocolate-coloured shirt who fired first"
"at the motorbike. It had been his evidence that the person who was wearing a"
"chocolate-coloured shirt, Kiki and another Tamil person whom he knows as Raja"
