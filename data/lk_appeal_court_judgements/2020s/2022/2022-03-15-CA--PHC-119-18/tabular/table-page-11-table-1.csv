"In  the  absence  of  any  amending  law  to  the  Excise  Ordinance,  the  principles"
"enunciated  by  early  case  law  under  the  Excise  Ordinance  must  be  used  as"
"guidance. Importation of principles from different laws must be discouraged. It"
"has always been accepted as axiomatic that judges administer justice according"
"to the prevailing law of the land. As His Lordship Justice Maartensz observed in"
"Alice Kothalawala Vs. W.H. Perera and another (1937)1 CLJ 58p ‘Justice must"
"be done according to law. If hardship results from the law in force the remedy must"
"be affected by legislation. There would be chaos if a judge was entitled to create a"
"procedure to meet the exigencies of every case in which he considers the law would"
"work injustice’."
"Having thus set out the law relating to confiscation under the Excise Ordinance,"
"this court  will now examine the factual  circumstances of  the instant appeal to"
"determine whether the appellant’s vehicle ought to be confiscated."
"The appellant is the registered owner of the vehicle concerned. He contends that"
"the vehicle was parked at his brother-in-law’s residence on the day in question"

"brother-in-law’s house and later loaded onto the vehicle after he handed over the"
"keys. The Accused of the case is not known to the appellant. The evidence given"
"by the independent witness narrates the same version as the appellant. The claim"
"that  the  appellant  was  requested  to  hand  over  the  key  to  the  vehicle  was  not"
"disputed."
"On  a  perusal  of  the  brief,  a  suggestion  put  forward  by  the  prosecution  to  the"
"independent witness is that the appellant and the witness arrived after the illicit"
"liquor  was  unloaded  from  the  vehicle  for  inspection.  This  suggestion  is  in  line"
"with  the  version  of  the  prosecution,  which states  that  while  the  excise officers"
"pursued the vehicle transporting liquor, the driver (accused) has misled them and"
