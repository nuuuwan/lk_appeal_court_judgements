"quote  from  the  Book  titled  ‘Judicial  Conduct,  Ethics  and  Responsibilities’  by"
"Justice Dr. A.R.B. Amerasinghe. (at page 284)"
"“The  function  of  a  judge  is  to  give  effect  to  the  expressed  intention  of"
"Parliament. If legislation needs amendment, because it results in injustice,"
"the democratic processes must be used to bring about the change. This has"
"been unchallenged view expressed by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka for"
"almost a hundred years.”"
