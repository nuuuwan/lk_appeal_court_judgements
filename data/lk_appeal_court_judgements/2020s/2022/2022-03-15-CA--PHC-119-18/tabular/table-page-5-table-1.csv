"","is entitled to be heard on the question of forfeiture of the lorry, if he satisfied"
"","the court that the accused committed the offence without his knowledge or"
"","participation, his lorry will not be liable for forfeiture. The Magistrate must"
"","hear the owner of the lorry on the question of showing cause why the lorry"
"","is  not  liable  to  be  forfeited.  If  the  Magistrate  is  satisfied  with  the  cause"
"shown, he must restore the lorry to the owner…” (at page 43).",""
