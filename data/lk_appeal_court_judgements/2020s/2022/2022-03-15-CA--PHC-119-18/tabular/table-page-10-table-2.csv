"confiscation was referred to in B. P. Perera v M. B. Abrahams (S. I. Police) 64"
"NLR 456 where Abeysundera J observed the following:"
"“The only section in the Excise Ordinance enabling the confiscation of things"
"is section 54 (old section 51). According to sub-section (1) of that section, the"
"excisable article, materials, still, utensil, implement or apparatus in respect"
"of or by means of  which an offence has been committed under the Excise"
"Ordinance  shall  be  liable  to  confiscation.  Sub-section  (2)  of  that  section"
"provides for the confiscation inter alia, of any conveyance used in carrying"
"any excisable article lawfully imported, transported, manufactured, had in"
"possession, or sold along with, or in addition to, any excisable article liable"
"to confiscation under that section. The aforesaid section does not  apply to"
"the  present  case  and  the  motor  car  in  question  cannot  be  confiscated"
"thereunder. Moreover, as contended by counsel for the appellant, there is no"
"evidence of the implication of the owner of the motor car in the offence with"
"which the accused were charged. Nor is there any evidence to show that the"
"driver of the motor car was an employee of the owner...” (Emphasis added)"
