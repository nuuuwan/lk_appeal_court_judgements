"","This is an application by the appellant to have the order of the learned High Court"

"","The facts of  the case are briefly as follows –  On 18.08.2017,  a  plaint was filed"
"","against an accused under the provisions of the Excise Ordinance as amended by"
"","Act  No.  37  of  1990  (Hereinafter  Excise  Ordinance).  On  the  same  day,  the  said"

"","Among the productions at the trial was the vehicle bearing Registered No. WP PA"
"","9676,  which  is  the  subject  matter  of  this  application.  An  inquiry  ensued  to"
