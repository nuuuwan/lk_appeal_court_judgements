"upon the Court to adjudicate in terms of Section 68 (1) and 68 (3) of the Primary"
"Courts’ Procedure Act who was in possession of the disputed land two months prior"
"to the date of filing of information."
"I
t was the finding of the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge that"
"the 1st Party Petitioner was dispossessed from the premises in dispute on 02.04.2017."
"Thus,  in terms of Section 68 (3) of the Primary Courts’  Procedure Act,  it appears"
"that the party was forcibly dispossessed within a period of two months immediately"
"before the date on which the information was filed. The Court draws the attention"
"to the Order made by the learned High Court Judge on 29.01.2019, where he found"
"that  according  to  the  case  register  marked  and  produced  as  “මප23(ආ)”,  the"
"information was filed on 31.05.2017."
"I
t is apparent that since the 1st Party Petitioner was dispossessed on 02.04.2017, and"
"the information was filed on 31.05.2017, hence the information was filed within a"
"period of two months prior to the date on which the information was filed."
"T
herefore, in terms of Section 68 (3) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, I hold"
"that the 1st Party Petitioner is entitled to be restored to possession of the disputed"
"land and have all disturbances of such possession prohibited. As such, the learned"
"Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge had erred in Law by holding against the"
"1st Party Petitioner."
"I
n view of the foregoing reasons, we are inclined to set aside the Order of the learned"
"Magistrate dated 06.02.2017 and the Order made by the learned High Court Judge"
"dated 18.08.2020."
"C
ourt observes that the 1st Party Petitioner has prayed in prayer (b) and (c) of the"
"Petition  to  revise  or  set  aside  the  Order  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  dated"
"18.08.2020 and to have him directed to hear this application on its merits and to set"
"aside the Order of the learned Magistrate of Kaduwela dated 06.02.2017 in case No."
"3641/17/66 considering the merits of its application."
