"Having considered the aforesaid grounds to make this application for revision, it is"
"seen that the 1st Party Petitioner has substantiated that exceptional circumstances"
"exist to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court."
"I
t is to be noted that the learned High Court Judge held there was no dispute causing"
"breach of peace."
"I
t is settled law that the jurisdiction for the learned Primary Court Judge to hear an"
"application made under Section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act comes only"
"when there is breach of peace or a likelihood of it. Therefore, when the High Court"
"Judge held there is no breach of peace, there is no jurisdiction and the only order"
"the  learned  Magistrate  could  have  made  was  to  dismiss  the  petition  for  want  of"
"jurisdiction."
"I
t is worthy to note that there was clear and cogent evidence of a breach of peace"
"and Mulleriyawa Police had filed an information on 07.03.2017 in case bearing No."
"1864/17 under Section 81 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act."
"I
t is evident that the owners of the impugned land had entered into an agreement"
"to  sell  the  said  property  with  the  1st  Party  Petitioner  and  has  handed  over  the"
"possession to the Petitioner. Thereafter, the Petitioner had employed two security"
"officers  from  Ceylinco  Security  Services  to  protect  the  land.  On  02.03.2017,  the"
"Respondents had entered the land and started erecting fences."
"S
ubsequently,  the  Mulleriyawa  Police  had  removed  the  fence  erected  by  the"
"Respondents  and  warned  them  not  to  enter  the  impugned  land.  However,  the"
"Respondent had entered the impugned land on 02.04.2017 and had started erecting"
"huts in different areas of the land and dispossessed the Petitioner of the same."
"I
t clearly shows that there was a breach of peace threatened between the 1st Party"
"Petitioner and the Respondent. Thus, the learned Magistrate who was acting as the"
"Primary Court Judge had jurisdiction to entertain the information filed in terms of"
"Section 66 (1) (b) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act."
"S
ince this matter arising out of the Order of the learned Magistrate dealt with an"
"application under Section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, it is incumbent"
