"Judge had just held that the shares should be allocated according to the pedigree of"
"the Plaintiff without considering the claim of the Appellants put forward in their issues."
"A
 similar situation arose in the case of SopiNona Vs. PitipanaArachchi and two others"
"[2010]  1  SLR  87.  In  that  case  also,  the  District  Judge  had  ordered  to  partition  the"
"corpus. The Respondentâ€™s allegation before the Court of Appeal was that their deeds"
"were not at all considered. The learned District Judge had decided on the allocation of"
"shares in accordance with the pedigree of the Plaintiff without examining the title of"
"all  the  parties  and  without  examining  and  considering  the  deeds  produced  by  the"
"Appellants.  Thus,  the  learned  District  Judge  failed  to  analyze  the  totality  of  the"
"evidence  led  at  the  trial.  The  learned  District  Judge  had  answered  only  one  issue-"
"namely issue No. 01 raised by the Plaintiff which he had answered in the affirmative."
"That issue was based not only on the devolution of title of the Plaintiff but also on the"
"prescriptive  rights  of  the  Plaintiff.  Therefore,  it  became  necessary  to  consider  and"
"analyze the evidence to ascertain whether parties disclosed in the plaint had prescribed"
"the land in question. However, the learned District Judge had failed to do."
"I
n view of the aforementioned judicial decisions, it is pertinent to note that it is a prime"
"duty of a trial judge to examine and evaluate the totality of the evidence available and"
"answer all the points of contest giving reasons as to why they are accepted or rejected."
"At  the  commencement  of  the  trial,  all  parties  had  formulated  29  points  of  contest."
"However, the learned trial Judge had answered only 1-10 points of contest and had not"
"answered points of contest 11-29 after going through the entire trial."
"P
resumably,  if  the  learned  trial  Judge  analyzed  and  considered  the  evidence  led  on"
"points  of  contest  and  answered  the  rest  of  the  issue,  the  decision  would  have  been"
"different. It is observable that the learned Trial Judge had not analyzed and evaluated"
"the evidence with regard to the investigation of title."
"T
hus,  I  hold  that  the  Judgment  of  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  is  a  nullity."
"Hence, we set aside the Judgment of the District Court dated 06.10.2000 and send this"
"case back to the District Court of Pugoda directing the present District Judge to adopt"
