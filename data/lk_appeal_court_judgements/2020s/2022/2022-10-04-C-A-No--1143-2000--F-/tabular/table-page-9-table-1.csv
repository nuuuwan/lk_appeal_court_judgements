"a)  The learned Additional District Judge erred when she held that the plaint should"
"be dismissed on the ground that the Plaintiff has not proved the case as this is"
"an action for partition and that the proper co-owners were before the court and"
"had proved their title, and the 5th Defendant-Appellant whose rights have been"
"proved, is entitled to a divided portion as pleaded by him in his statement of"
"claim."
"b)  The  learned  Additional  District  Judge  failed  to  consider  the  fact  that  the  5th"
"Defendant-Appellant who had acquired the title from ‘5V1’, which in fact has"
"been accepted by the Learned Additional District Judge, has a better title than"
"the  10th  to  16th  Defendant-Respondents  who  enjoy  the  property.  The  Learned"
"Additional District Judge has held that the 10th to 16th Defendant–Respondents"
"have not proved their titles. Therefore, the Learned District Judge should have"
"held  in  favour  of  the  5th  Defendant-Appellant  who  has  successfully  proved  his"
"case."
"c)  The evidence in this case clearly proves that only the Plaintiff and the 1st to 5th"
"Defendants are entitled to rights and title in the land, and therefore the Plaintiff"
"and the 1st to 5th Defendants are entitled to have the land partitioned among"
"them and therefore the plaint should not have been dismissed."
"d)  The Judgment itself is contradictory as the Learned District Judge has held that"
"the heirs of Laisa Hamy and Pesona Hamy are entitled to the rights in the land,"
"but has also held that the Plaintiff and the 1st to 3rd Defendants had failed to file"
"a  partition  action  until  1978  and  therefore  it  is  doubtful  whether  they  had"
"possession. It is respectfully submitted that even if they were not in possession,"
"they are entitled to obtain possession and therefore have a right to have the land"
"partitioned."
"e)  The said judgment dated 06.12.2000 is not based on evidence before the Court"
"and therefore is unreasonable and wrong and, that the 5th Defendant-Appellant"
"is therefore deprived of his rights to have peaceful possession of a divided portion"
"of land."
