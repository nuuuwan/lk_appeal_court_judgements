"(vii)","The Trial Court was in error when it has convicted the 3rd accused-appellant for murder in"
"","the absence of any direct or circumstantial evidence."
"","The learned President’s Counsel who appeared of behalf of the 1st accused-appellant argued the"
"","matter requesting from courts  and from the Hon. Attorney General to see whether there is any"
"","possibility for a shortcut, considering the circumstances of this case as well as the evidence which"
"","were led before the trial court.  His contention was that the charge of murder has not been proved"
"","beyond  reasonable  doubt  and  the  1st to  4th  accused-appellants  should be  acquitted  for the  said"
"charge as the court cannot maintain the conviction for murder.",""
"","Learned Additional Solicitor General who appeared on behalf of the respondent requests more time"
"","to  consult  Hon.  Attorney  General  before  he  takes  a  final  decision.  Thereafter  the  case  was"
"","adjourned  for  a  short  date  and  when  it  was  resumed  on  the  09.09.2022  the  learned  Additional"
"","Solicitor General address this court an informed that he is conceding that he cannot  sustain the"
"conviction for murder. He further says that:",""
"","There are several items of circumstantial evidence led by the prosecution. But cumulative"
"","effect of all those items of evidence insufficient to satisfy the requirements in a case based"
"","on circumstantial evidence, based on those judgments of the Supreme Court and the Court"
"","of Appeal. It is a fact that the deceased was at the residence of the 1st and 2nd accused till"
"","about, 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock on the 4th of April of that particular year. Thereafter where she"
"","went, with whom she was, what she did, nobody knows."
"","Learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that she was last seen at the residence of the 1st and"
"","2nd accused by the daughter of the victim and thereafter we do not know what happened. Her dead"
"","body was found two days later on information provided by some informant to the police. The police"
"","went and recovered the dead body which was floating in a canal. The dead body was recovered in"
"","the presence of the Magistrate. The prosecution will have to establish in some nexus between the"
"","dead body and the acts of the accused persons. With regard to where the deceased might have"
"","been after she was attacked or assaulted at the residence of the 1st and 2nd accused persons, we"
"have no evidence except two or three items of circumstantial evidence.",""
"","It is evident that PW 2 has stated that the very next day, the day after both of them were assaulted,"
"","two persons known to the deceased, had visited the residence of the 1st and 2nd accused persons"
"","to make inquiries about the deceased and the 1st accused had told those two persons, “we do not"
"know she went at about 8 o'clock. She left this place. We do not know where she is now.”",""
"","The learned President’s Counsel for the respondent submitted that unfortunately, that evidence of"
"","those two visitors, not being led. So, we really do not know exactly where the deceased ought to"
"","have been if not for this incident, probably she is a beggar woman without a permanent place. She"
"did not have a permanent place of staying.",""
