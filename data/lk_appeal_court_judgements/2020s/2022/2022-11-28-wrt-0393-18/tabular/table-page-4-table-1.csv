"Administration  had  given  his  consent  to  pay  50%  of  the  W  and  OP  to  the"
"Petitioner  under  section  37  of  the  Widows’  and  Orphans’  Pension  Scheme"
"(Armed Forces) Act No. 18 of 1970. By the letter marked P4 the Director General"
"of Pensions had conveyed the aforesaid decision of the 2nd Respondent to the"
"Petitioner. It is apparent from the letter dated 30th August 2018 marked P6 that"
"the  commander  of  the  Sri  Lanka  Army  had  referred  this  matter  to  the  Hon."
"Attorney General for advise and the Hon. Attorney General had expressed the"
"opinion that the Petitioner is entitled to the full pension."
"By the letter marked P7 the Commander of the Army had informed the opinion"
"expressed by the Hon. Attorney General to the Director of Pensions. By the letter"
"marked  P22  the  Petitioner  had  made  an  appeal  to  the  2nd  Respondent,  the"
"Secretary to the ministry of Public Administration to reconsider his decision and"
"grant her the full pension and on behalf of the Petitioner her attorney-at-law"
"had made the same request to the 2nd Respondent by the letter marked P26C."
"By the letter marked P28 the 2nd Respondent had conveyed his decision to the"
"Petitioner and informed that there is no change in his earlier decision. From the"
"letter  dated  28.09.2020  marked  2R5A  it  is  apparent  that  the  Hon.  Attorney"
"General  had  conveyed  his  decision  to  the  2nd  Respondent,  the  Secretary  to"
"Ministry  of  Public  Administration  and  the  2nd  Respondent  by  that  letter  had"
"informed the Hon. Attorney General that for the reasons stated there in that"
"letter and in that background he had taken the decision to pay 50% of the W and"
"OP to the Petitioner under section 37 of the Act no 18 of 1970."
"Therefore, it is apparent from the letter marked 2R5A that the 2nd Respondent,"
"the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration was not willing to accept"
"the opinion expressed by the Hon. Attorney General regarding this matter and"
"he had taken into consideration irrelevant matters before arriving at a decision."
"He had referred to the fact that, although the Petitioner is in a position to seek"
"legal  assistance  regarding  this  matter  because  of  her  social  and  economic"
"background there are many people in this country who are unable to get legal"
"protection in similar matters. He had also referred to the fact that a full pension"
"and allowances are paid to a war widow as a mark of respect to the deceased"
"officer  and  in  a  society  like  ours  the  war  widow  herself  should  behave  in  a"
"manner that will bring honour and respect to the deceased officer. It is against"
"the expectations of the society to deliver an illegitimate child which will tarnish"
