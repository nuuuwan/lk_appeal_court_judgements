"two  deep  stab  injuries  on  the  back  of  the  chest  of  the  deceased.    As  per  the"
"evidence  of  the  doctor,  the  stab  injuries  penetrated  the  lungs  of  the  deceased"
"and damaged the arteries of the lung.  The doctor described that such injuries"
"would cause the death of a person in the ordinary course of nature."
"The evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer who gave evidence before the court"
"was not challenged by the defence at all.  Only two questions  were  put to the"
"doctor by the defence, to the effect that the doctor gave evidence based on the"
"PMR  prepared  by  Dr.  Dissanayake  and  he  himself  did  not  conduct  the  post-"

"stands unchallenged."
"The evidence of the two eyewitnesses also stands uncontradicted."
"The  appellant  in  his  dock  statement  took  up  the  position  that  the  deceased"

"how the deceased sustained two stab injuries on the back of the chest. None of"
"the witnesses has seen any kind of commotion or struggle. This position is not"
"put to the prosecution witnesses. The appellant stated that he had the handle"
"of  the  knife  in  his  hand,  and  he  went  to  the  police  station  with  the  handle  of"
"the knife.  The appellant did not say how the handle of the knife came into his"
"possession."
"The evidence clearly establishes the fact that the deceased died of stab injuries,"
"caused by the appellant."
