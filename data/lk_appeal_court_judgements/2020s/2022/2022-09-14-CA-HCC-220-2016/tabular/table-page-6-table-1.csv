"“I  charge  the 
jury  that  they  should 
in  the  first  place  consider  the  question"
"whether the accused was capable of making his defence, whether he sufficiently"
"understand the proceedings what is alleged against him, what he was entitled to"
"do and say his power to bring forward witnesses in his defence.”"
"In  the  case  of  Dusky  vs  United  States  362  US402  [1960],  the  U.S.Supreme"
"Court  held  that;  to  be  competent  to  stand  trial  the  accused  must  have  a"
"“sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of"
"rational  understanding  and  a  rational  as  well  as  factual  understanding  of  the"
"proceedings against him.”"
"In the instant case, the appellant was defended by the counsel throughout the"
"trial  and 
the  appellant  made  along  dock  statement  as  his  defence.  The"
"appellant  absconded  the  trial  for  two  years  and  he  said  that  because  of  this"
"case,  he  lost  his  income  and  he  had  to  go  abroad  to  do  a  job.  Therefore,  it  is"
"clear 
that  he  had  understood 
the  charge  against  him  and  given  proper"
"instruction  to  his  counsel.    After  considering  the  above-mentioned  case  laws,"
"the provisions of law and the circumstances, I see no deficiency in making his"
"defence by the appellant at the trial court.  Therefore, this ground of appeal has"
"no merit and I reject the same."
"The  second  ground  of  appeal  is  that  the  prosecution  did  not  establish  the"
"cause  of  death  of  the  deceased.  Counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted  that  the"
"doctor  who  conducted  the  post-mortem  inquiry  was  not  called  as  a  witness."
"The  doctor  who  performed  the  post-mortem  was  unavailable  to  give  evidence"
"before the court as he was seriously ill and not competent to testify in court."
"There  were  two  eyewitnesses,  namely  PW1  and  PW2,  who  saw  the  appellant"
"stabbing  the  deceased  from  the  back.  There  was  no  serious  challenge  against"
"the testimony of these two eyewitnesses."
