"owever, the Appellant contended that a similar provision to the said Section 59 (6) was enacted"
"in Section 38 (3) of the Employees’ Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958 where it states;"
"“The correctness of any statement in a certificate issued by the Commissioner for the"
"purposes of this Section shall not be called in question or examined by the Court in any"
"proceeding under this Section, and accordingly nothing in this Section shall authorise"
"the Court to consider or decide the correctness of any statement in such certificate, and"
"the Commissioner’s certificate shall be sufficient evidence that the amount due under"
"this Act from the defaulting employer has been duly calculated and that such amount"
"is in default.”"
