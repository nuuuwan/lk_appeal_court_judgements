he  learned  State  Counsel  argues  that  the  Petitioner  has  suppressed  the  fact  that  he"
"had cultivated vegetable on ‘60 perches’ of the school land and attempted to impress"
"the  Court  that  he  had  used  only  ‘a  small  portion  of  the  land’  for  his  vegetable"
"cultivation.  Therefore,  the  learned  State  Counsel  argues  that  the  Petitioner  has  not"
"come  to  Court  with  clean  hands  and  on  that  reason,  he  should  not  be  entitled  to"
"prerogative reliefs by way of writs. There is no Surveyor plan for the satisfaction of"
"the  Court  that  the  extent  of  the  land  utilized  for  the  private  use  of  the  Petitioner  is"
"exactly 60 perches. Nevertheless, especially in paragraphs 8 to 10, 12, 13, 22, 23, 28,"
"29, 34, 39, 42 and 43 the Petitioner has disclosed the facts about the cultivation done"

"the outcome of the inquiry. Therefore, even though, the Petitioner has not stated  the"
"exact extent of the land he utilized for his private purpose, the Court can be satisfied"
"that  he  has  not  suppressed  the  fact  that  he  has  done  a  vegetable  cultivation  on  the"
"school land without permission of the authorities and the consequences he had faced"
"thereafter.  It  has been admitted that the amount which the Petitioner was  held  to  be"
"liable  to  pay  as  tax  to  the  State  for  his  vegetable  cultivation  was  deducted  from  his"
"commuted pension. In any event the Petitioner does not seek any relief regarding the"
"tax he had paid to the State. Therefore, the extent of the land which the Petitioner has"
"cultivated the vegetable is not a material and an important fact to consider in issuing"
"the writs sought by the Petitioner and the above stated argument of the learned State"
"Counsel is devoid of merits."
"A
nother  argument  of  the  learned  State  Counsel  is  that  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to"
