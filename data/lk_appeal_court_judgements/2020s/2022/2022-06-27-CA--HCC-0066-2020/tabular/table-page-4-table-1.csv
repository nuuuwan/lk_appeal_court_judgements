"It  was  her  evidence  that  she  informed  the  person  who  was  in  charge  of  the"
"guest  house  that  she  is  being  taken  forcibly  but  he  did  not  help  her.  The"
"appellant then forced her to a room against her will and she was in a confused"
"state  of  mind  due  to  what  happened  to  her.  Although  she  pleaded  with  the"
