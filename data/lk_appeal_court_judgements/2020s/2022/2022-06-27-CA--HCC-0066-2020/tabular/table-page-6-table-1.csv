"statement,  it  does  not  mean  that  he  has  given  false  evidence.  There  was  no"
"application  by  the  prosecuting  State  Counsel  to  treat  the  witness 
in  that"
"manner  when  he  gave  evidence,  subjected 
to  cross  examination  and  re-"
"examination.  It  was  only  after  the  questioning  of  the  witness  by  the  Learned"
"High Court Judge the need to charge the witness for giving false evidence has"
"been mooted before the Court."
"Although the PW-02 has been granted bail on 01-08-2019 the case record does"
"not indicate whether the witness was in fact charged for giving false evidence. I"
"find that since it was an application on behalf of the Hon. Attorney-General, it"
"is the duty of the Attorney-General to decide whether to charge the witness or"
"not, without leaving him in limbo for so long."
"With  the  above  comments,  I  would  now  turn  my  attention  to  the  rest  of  the"
"evidence led in this  action. The fact that the prosecutrix made a statement to"
"police while warded at the Marawila Base Hospital on 06-07-2013 to WPC 1702"
"Kanchana, and the fact that the said police officer has observed several injuries"
"on  the  prosecutrix  are  admitted 
facts  under  Section  420  of  the  Criminal"
"Procedure Code. The police officer has observed a bluish swelling near the right"
"eye of the prosecutrix and several abrasions on her right cheek and neck. She"
"has also observed another abrasion in the lower part of the right hand."
"The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who examined the prosecutrix after she was"
"admitted to the hospital has given evidence in this case, and has marked this"
"Medico-Legal Report as P-02. He has examined the prosecutrix on 07-08-2013."
"After recording the history narrated by the prosecutrix, he has observed several"
"injuries  on  her.  He  has  found  an  abrasion  placed  over  the  right  side  of  the"
"cheek,  swelling  of  the  per  orbital  area  of  the  left  eye,  abrasion  placed  over"
"anterior  aspect  of  the  neck,  another  abrasion  placed  over  anterior  aspect  of"
"lower  part  of  the  right  hand  and  abrasion  over  posterior  aspect  of  the  upper"
"part of the elbow."
