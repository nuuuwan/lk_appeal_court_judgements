"which the law only requires that particulars as to time as are sufficient"
"as to give the accused notice of the crime and to show that the offence"
"is not prescribed need to be given. He further submitted that  there"
"was no express provision made by the Legislature with regard to how"
"the “time” should be restricted to one year (which would only apply to"
"offences  specified  under  section  165(2)  of  the  Code)  for  other  Penal"
"Code  offences.  Therefore,  it  was  further  contended  by  the  learned"
"Senior  Deputy  Solicitor  General  that  with  regard  to  the  offence  of"
"Grave Sexual Abuse there is no statutory restriction how particulars"
"of time should be stated in an indictment. Thus, the learned Senior"
"Deputy  Solicitor  General  for  the  Respondent  also  contended  that"
"when a charge gives a time range instead of a specific date there is"
"no  violation  of  any  legal  condition.  As  such,  the  learned  Senior"
"Deputy  Solicitor  General  for  the  Respondent  finally  took  up  the"
"position that the indictment in the instant case is prima facie a legal"
"and maintainable indictment in law and it is not subject to the writ"
"jurisdiction of this Court."
"It is true that an indictment is a crucial document which provides a"
"formal notice to an accused, on what basis and manner he or she is"
"going  to  be  charged.  Thus,  it  is  always  vital  that  an  indictment"
"should contain all such particulars reasonably and particularly. If"
"such reasonable particulars were not given or such particulars are"
"erroneous, then there is a possibility that the accused may be misled"
"by such error or omission."
"Section 166 of the Code provides thus,"
