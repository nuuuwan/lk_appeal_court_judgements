"General 
has 
exercised 
his 
Prosecutorial 
Discretion 
upon"
"unreasonable grounds and in an arbitrary and capricious manner."
"If  the  Attorney  General  carried  out  his  discretion  objectively,  it  is"
"unlikely that a court of law exercising jurisdiction to judicial review,"
"would intervene with the decision merely because it disagrees with"
"the decision it arrived at."
"Moreover,  as  mentioned  hereinbefore, 
if  there  are  any  serious"
"objections  as 
to 
the  contents  of 
the 
indictment  and 
the 
trial"
"procedure,  the  Petitioner  has  the  liberty  to  take  such  objections"
"before the relevant High Court under the Code of Criminal Procedure"
"Act. As such, in my view, if the Petitioner has an alternative remedy"
"for  the  alleged  grievances  in  the  Original  Court  (High  Court),  he"
"cannot invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court and has to pursue"
"the alternative remedy."
"In  such  circumstances, 
I  view  that  the  grounds  relied  by  the"
"Petitioner  are  devoid  of  merits  and  thus,  I  see  this  case  is  not"
"suitable for full investigation at a hearing at which all parties have"
"been given notice."
"Accordingly, I refuse to issue notice on the Respondent and dismiss"
"the application without costs."
"Notice refused."
