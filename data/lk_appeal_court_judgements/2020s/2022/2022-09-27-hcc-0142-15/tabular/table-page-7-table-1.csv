"Appellant  had  taken  up  the  position  that  he  was  assaulted  by  a  person"
"called  Karunaratna  with  an  axe,  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in  his"
"judgment  had  concluded  that  it  has  not  been  proved  through  the  medical"
"evidence."
"The Appellant had been examined by PW13 DMO of Weligedera Hospital on"
"17/10/2008. The doctor had checked his body and noted a mild abrasion"
"in  the  middle  of  his  left  forearm  which  had  been  categorised  as  a  non-"
"grievous  injury.  He  has  opined  that  the  injury  could  have  been  sustained"
"due  to  the  contact  with  hard  object.  The  Medico  Legal  Report  of  the"
"appellant was marked as P-4 by the prosecution."
"Although  the  Appellant  had  taken  up  the  position  that  the  incident  had"
"occurred  due  to  a  sudden  fight  ensued  with  one  Karunaratna  who  had"
"assaulted him with an mamoty when he entered the deceasedâ€™s house. But"
"according  to  PW13  he  had  noted  a  mild  abrasion  on  at  middle  of  left"
"forearm  of  the  Appellant.  Hence,  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  very"
"correctly come to the conclusion that the position taken by the Appellant in"
"his  dock  statement  had  not  been  reflected  in  his  Medico  Legal  Report."
"Therefore, this ground also has no merit."
"In the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned High"
"Court Judge has not considered the evidence favourable to the Appellant in"
"his judgment."
"With  all  the  evidence  presented  by  the  prosecution  and  the  defence,  it"
"appears  that  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  appropriately  evaluated"
"the  evidence  in  delivering  his  verdict.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had"
"considered the dock statement of the Appellant in the judgment. Hence, it"
"is incorrect to say that the Learned High  Court  Judge had  not considered"
"the  evidence  favourable  to  the  Appellant.  Hence,  this  ground  also  has  no"
"merit."
