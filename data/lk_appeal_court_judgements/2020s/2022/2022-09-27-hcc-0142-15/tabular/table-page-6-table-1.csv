the  Ehaliyagoda  Police  station.  Even

"existence of a love affair between with deceased’s daughter Anoma and the"
"Appellant,  but  no  connection  whatsoever  existed  with  the  Appellant  and"
"Anoma at the time of the incident."
"It 
is  the  uncontradicted  evidence  of 
lay  witnesses  that  on  seeing  the"
"Appellant,  witnesses  raised  cries  and  ran  for  safety.  This  clearly  indicates"
"the  amount  of  animosity  the  Appellant  had  towards  the  deceased’s  family"
"prior  to  the  incident.  When  the  Appellant  entered  the  deceased’s  house"
"despite  being  barred  by  the  police,  clearly  infers  intention  for  launching  a"
"murderous  attack  on 
the 
inmates  of  deceased’s  house.  Hence, 
it 
is"
"incorrect 
to

"Learned  High  Court  Judge  only  considered  the  dock  statement  of  the"
"Appellant to negate his stance that he acted in self-defence to escape from"
"the deceased. Hence, this ground too devoid of any merit."
"In  the  third  ground  of  appeal  the  appellant  argues  that  the  evidence  does"
"not  support  the  conclusion  reached  by  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in"
