"The Text Book on the Indian Penal Code by K.D. Gaur, Fourth Edition at pages 178 and 179 are"
"as follows;"
"“A man is justified in resisting by force anyone who manifestly intends and endeavours"
"by violence or surprise to commit a known felony against either his person, habitation or"
"property. In these cases, he is not obligated to retreat, and may not merely resist the"
"attack where he stands but may indeed pursue his adversary until the danger is ended"
"and if in a conflict between them, he happens to kill his attacker, such killing is justifiable.”"
"Chacko Mathai vs State of Kerala AIR 1964 KER 222 was held as follows;"
"""The  right  of  private  defence  is  a  highly  prized  gift  granted  to  the  citizen  to  protect"
"themselves by effective self-resistance against unlawful aggression. No man is expected"
"to fly away when he is attacked. He could fight back and when he apprehends death or"
"grievous hurt could see that his adversary is vanquished without modulating his defence"
"step  by  step.  Faced  with  a  dangerous  adversary,  no  man  can  act  with  a  detached"
"reflection and under such circumstances, if he travels a little beyond the limit, the law"
"protects him and hence courts should not place more restrictions on him than the law"
"demands."""
"On the other hand, according to the prosecution witnesses, it reveals that the deceased was an"
"aggressor. According to prosecution evidence on that faithful day, the deceased fought with the"
"appellant."
"It is a settled principle under criminal law that the prosecution should prove their case beyond a"
"reasonable doubt. When there are witnesses it is reasonable if one witness cannot recall the"
"incident and testifies a different thing about the incident. But it is quite suspicious if all the main"
"witnesses  tell  different  stories  about  the  same  points.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the  accused-"
"appellant argued that when we consider the evidence of this case, we can believe that there are"
"no  actual  eyewitnesses.  Prosecution  witnesses  contradicted  the  evidence  given  on  material"
"points  which  they  gave  in  the  examination  in  chief  and  cross-examination.  They  have  given"
"different versions."
"The learned counsel for the accused-appellant further argued that it is a cardinal principle that"
"unreliable  and  unacceptable  evidence  cannot  be  rendered  credible,  simply  because  there  is"
"some corroborative material. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the"
"shadow  of  a  doubt.  The  benefit  of the  doubt,  to  which  the  accused  is entitled,  is  reasonable"
"doubt;  the  doubt  which  rational  thinking  men  will  reasonably,  honestly  and  conscientiously"
"entertain and not the doubt of a timid mind."
"It is our view that the evidence of the accused-appellant attracts the plea of a grave and sudden"
"provocation  and  self-defence.  This  court  came  to  the  said  conclusion  of  the  present  appeal,"
"considering the behaviour of the deceased before this unfortunate incident. The appellant has"
"further testified that the scuffle between him and the deceased had accidentally resulted in the"
"deceased causing his death thereby attracting the plea of a grave and sudden provocation and"
"self-defence as embodied in special exceptions 1 and 3 to section 294 of the Penal Code."
