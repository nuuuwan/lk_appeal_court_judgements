"Magistrate in respect of an application under the provisions of the State Land (Recovery of"
"Possession) Act. Hence, the learned High Court Judge is of the view that any matter relating to"
"the “State Lands” cannot be reviewed in any manner in the Provincial High Court."
"I
t is relevant to note that the ratio decidendi of the Judgment in Solaimuthu Rasu’s case, which"
"held that the Provincial High Court had no jurisdiction to issue writs under Article 154P (4) of"
"the Constitution pertaining to the state lands."
"I
n order for the Provincial High Courts to exercise writ jurisdiction, the issue should be one"
"that falls within the purview of the Provincial Council list. Since the subject-state lands does"
"not  fall  within  the  purview  of  the  Provincial  Council  list,  Provincial  High  Court  is  not"
"empowered  to  issue  writs  under  Article  154P  (4)  of  the  Constitution  in  respect  of  matters"
"pertaining to state lands."
"N
ext, Court draws the attention to Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution of the Democratic"
"Socialist Republic which stipulates that,"
"“Every such High Court shall notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to"
"any Law, exercise appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions,"
"sentences and orders entered or imposed by Magistrate’s Courts and Primary Courts"
"within the province”."
"I
t is noteworthy that revisionary jurisdiction in terms of Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution,"
"has  not  excluded  the  power  to  exercise  appellate  or  revisionary  jurisdiction  regarding  state"
"lands."
"I
t was held in the case of Jayawardhane Vs. Deen [(2015)1 SLR 181] that High Court has"
"jurisdiction to hear and determine cases relating to state lands, acting in revision.  In view of"
"the case of Divisional Secretary Kalutara Vs. Kalupahana Mestrige Jayatissa (unreported)"
"SC Appeal 246,247,249 & 250/14 (Judgment delivered on 04.08.2017); the Supreme Court"
"did not consider the objection to jurisdiction of the High Court which was taken up on behalf"
"of the Applicant in such case. “I do not wish to consider this issue in the present Judgment for"
"two reasons. Firstly, in the case referred to, the Supreme Court dealt with the powers of the"
"Provincial High Court under Article 154P (4) of the Constitution (writ jurisdiction), whereas"
"in  the  instant  case,  the  Provincial  High  Court  derives  jurisdiction  under  Article  154P  (3)"
