"by  letter  dated  25.10.2016  marked  P10,  the  1st  Respondent  Authority"
"decided to issue a deed of conveyance for 1/6 share of the house to the"
"Petitioner and 5/6 share to the 5th Respondent."
"Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioner had preferred a Writ"
"application bearing No. CA 385/2016 to this Court. On 08.01.2019, the"
"Petitioner  had  withdrawn  the  said  writ  application,  subject  to  filing  a"
"fresh application on the basis that the 1st Respondent having held a fresh"
"inquiry with the consent of the Petitioner, made an order to convey the"
"entirety  of  the  subject  matter  to  the  5th  Respondent.  The  order  of  the"
"Court of Appeal in case No. Writ 385/2016 is marked as P14 and the said"
"decision of the 1st Respondent is marked as P13."
"Being aggrieved by the said decision marked P13, the instant application"
"is preferred by the Petitioner seeking to quash the decisions containing"
"in the document marked as P10, P11 and P13 on the footing that the said"
"decisions are arbitrary and unreasonable."
"The Court is mindful of the fact that the decisions marked  as P10 and"
"P11  are  inoperative  at  the  time  of  the  institution  of  this  case,  and"
"therefore, the Petitioner is not entitled to seek a writ of Certiorari to quash"
"the said decisions."
"I shall now ascertain as to whether the decision marked P13 is arbitrary"
"and unreasonable."
"The original lessee W.D. Buddhasena demised before the execution of the"
"deed  of  conveyance.  As  such,  it  is  an  undisputed  fact  that the  current"
"owner of the subject matter is the 1st Respondent. In the circumstances,"
"the 1st Respondent has every right to decide that in whose favour the deed"
"of conveyance to be executed. Furthermore, the Petitioner has no legal"
"right  to  challenge  the  aforesaid  decisions  of  the  Respondents  and  to"
"demand for a deed of transfer in his favour."
