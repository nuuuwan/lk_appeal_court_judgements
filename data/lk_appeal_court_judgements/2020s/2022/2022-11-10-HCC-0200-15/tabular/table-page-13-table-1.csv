"4th appellant who fired at him first, and he does not speak about the number of"
"persons firing at him at the initial firing. However, the evidence of PW-02 had"
"been that 4 or 5 persons started shooting indiscriminately at the deceased and"
"the PW-01, which shows that there had been at least more than one shooter at"

"in committing the offence."
