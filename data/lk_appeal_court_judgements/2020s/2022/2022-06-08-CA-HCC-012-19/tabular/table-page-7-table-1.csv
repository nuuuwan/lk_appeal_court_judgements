he conclusion that there was a big noise from a crowd. This noise may"
"occur when there is a fight between two or more persons. At the same"

n her testimony, PW4 indicated that the deceased ran to her hotel and"
"that  the  appellant  followed  him.  She  stated  that  the  appellant  then"
"chased the deceased when the deceased ran out of her hotel. (The said"
"items of evidence are found on pages 38, 39, and 40 of the appeal brief)."
"Although the appellant was given the opportunity to cross-examine the"
"PW4,  no  single  question  was  asked  on  behalf  of  the  appellant.  Thus,"
"her evidence has never been challenged. According to PW4’s evidence,"
"it  is  obvious  that  there  could  not  be  a  sudden  fight  because  the"
"appellant  came  behind  the  deceased  when  the  deceased  rushed  to"
"PW4’s hotel and the appellant chased the deceased when he ran out of"
"the hotel. The said circumstances transpire that the deceased tried to"
"escape  from  the  appellant.  Hence,  the  evidence  in  this  case  clearly"
"demonstrates that there was no sudden fight. For these reasons, I hold"
"that  the  defence  of  a  sudden  fight  would  not  succeed.  Taking  all  the"
"circumstantial evidence and the dying declaration into account, it could"
"be concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant and no one"
"else committed the murder."

t  the  hearing  of  the  appeal,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"appellant  did  not  point  out  any  other  flaw  or  shortcoming  in  the"
"impugned judgment. When perusing the judgment of the learned High"
"Court  Judge,  it  becomes  clear  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge"
"carefully and properly evaluated the evidence in the case and correctly"
"decided that the appellant is guilty of murder."
