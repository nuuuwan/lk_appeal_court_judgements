ecorded a statement from PW1 on the 7th of August 1997.  She had identified"
"the  body  of  the  deceased  at  the  postmortem  in  the  presence  of  the  doctor  on"
"the  same  day,  in  the  evening.    Therefore,  a  mistake  on  the  part  of  the  Trial"
"Judge  regarding  the  date  of  the  statement  by  PW1  cannot  be  regarded  as  a"
"ground to attack the credibility of PW1."
"There  was  a  contradiction  marked  as  V1  concerning  as 
to  whether 
the"
"assailants shot the deceased from the road or from the land.  The learned High"
"Court  Judge  has  considered  this  discrepancy.  She  has  observed  that  the"
"position  of  PW1  was  that  “වත්ත  සහ  පාර  දෙකම  එකට  තිදෙන්දෙ…”.  The  police"
"witness also confirmed that the road was not a very wide road and only a gravel"
"road. There was a thicket on one side of the road.  The Judge has observed that"
"the  counsel  for  the  third  appellant  has  repeated  the  same  questions  many"
"times.    The  learned  Trial  Judge  decided  that  V1  is  not  a  vital  contradiction."
"Thus, I see no reason to disagree with this finding, especially when the second"
"accused came near the deceased who was fallen on the ground and shot him."
"The fact that the second accused had shot the deceased after he had fallen on"
"the ground was not challenged by the defence counsel.  The learned High Court"
"Judge has observed that the defence did not contest the position “වත්ත යි පාර යි"
"එකටම තිදෙන්දන්.  Therefore, the decision that the contradiction does not go to"
"the root of the case is correct."
"Another  point  taken  up  by  the  counsel  for  the 
first  appellant  is  that  the"
"evidence of PW2 has no reference to PW1.  PW2 was informed of this shooting"
"incident by Dayawathi, the eldest daughter of PW2.  PW2 who had not gone to"
"the  scene  at 
that 
time,  proceeded 
immediately 
to 
the  police.  PW2  had"
"mentioned that the two daughters were at home on that day.  PW2 came to the"
"scene  with  the  police. 
  Therefore,  there  was  nothing  to  suspect 
from  the"
"evidence  of  PW2,  that  PW1  was  not  at  the  scene  at  the  time  of  the  shooting."
"Counsel  for  the  first  appellant  argued  that  the  entire  evidence  of  PW2  was"
"hearsay.  What PW2 had stated to the police contains some hearsay evidence,"
