"Plaintiff  has  failed  to  prove  his  title  to  the  property  in  dispute  is  according  to  the"
"evidence led before the Court, his conclusion that the identity of the property has not"
"been  proved  is  against  the  evidence  led.  Therefore,  the  learned  Counsel  argued  that"

"In rei vindicatio actions the plaintiff must prove and establish his title to the property"
"in dispute and the defendant need not prove anything. If the plaintiff fails to prove and"
"establish his title, the action of the Plaintiff should fail. 1"
"In the instant action, the Plaintiff has failed to produce his title deed (No. 1849) at the"
"trial. Since the action of the Plaintiff is for a declaration of title, the learned District"
"Judge had no option other than dismissing the Plaintiff’s action. The argument of the"
"learned Counsel was that although the Plaintiff has proved the identity of the land, the"
"learned trial Judge has failed to consider the evidence in favour of the Plaintiff on the"
"corpus  and  answer  the  issues  on  the  corpus  affirmatively  in  favour  of  the  Plaintiff."
"When scrutinising the impugned judgment, it is apparent that the learned District Court"
"Judge has mainly drawn his attention to the fact whether the Plaintiff has proved his"
"title to the property in dispute to have a declaration of title in his favour."
