"In this respect, Court draws the attention to the Preamble of Government Quarters"
"(Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969 as well as the State Lands (Recovery of"
"Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979. The Preamble of Government Quarters (Recovery of"
"Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969 states, “An Act to make provisions for the recovery of"
"possession  of  quarters  provided  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  government  or  a  public"
"corporation for the occupation of persons, and for matters connected therewith or"
"incidental thereto”. The Preamble of State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No."
"7 of 1979 states, “An Act to make provisions for the recovery of possession of state"
"lands from persons in unauthorized possession or occupation thereof and for matters"
"connected therewith or incidental thereto”."
"It is worthy to note that both Acts, State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7"
"of 1979 and Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969 have"
"made  provisions  for  the  recovery  of  possession  of  the  subject  premises.  It  is"
"observable  that  there  is  not  much  difference  between  the  two  Acts,  State  Lands"
"(Recovery of Possession) Act and Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act."
"Therefore, it is worthy to note that no material prejudice has been caused to the"
"Appellant under the Order made to evict the Respondent from the subject matter"
"by the learned Magistrate referring to the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act"
"instead of Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act in his Order."
"Therefore,  Court  holds  that  the 
learned  Magistrate  has  proceeded  with  the"
"application  of  the  Competent  Authority  under  Government  Quarters  (Recovery  of"
"Possession) Act although the learned Magistrate had inadvertently referred to State"
"Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act in his order dated 20.11.2017."
"It  is  apparent  that  no  material  prejudice  is  caused  to  the  Respondent-Petitioner-"
"Appellant in this matter due to the inadvertence of the learned Magistrate indicating"
"the  State  Lands  (Recovery  of  Possession)  Act 
instead  of  Government  Quarters"
"(Recovery of Possession) Act in his Order. Thus, I hold that it is not a ground to set"
"aside the impugned Order of the Magistrate."
"This aspect of Law is emphasized by De Silva J. in W.M. Mendis & Co. Vs. Excise"
"Commissioner [1999] 1 SLR 351 in 356 that Falsa demonstratio non nocet cum de"
"corpore vel persona constat (a false description does not harm if there be sufficient"
