"Minutes 08.01.2019 in which his Lordship observes that,",""
"","“Although disposing of cases on technical grounds is easy and speedy.  But"
"","that is not what the aggrieved party expects from Court.  The aggrieved"
"","party  wants  case  to  be  disposed  of  on  merits  rather  than  on  technical"
"","grounds.  It  is  generally  the  wrongdoer  who  cannot  meet  the  case  on"
"","merits, tries to cling on technical objections to defeat justice.  We must"
"","understand that we are working in Courts of Law and not in Academies of"
"","Law  and  therefore,  in  my  view,  we  must,  as  much  as  possible,  try  to"
"dispose of cases on merits rather than on highly technical grounds.”",""
