"where  the  appellant  lived.  If  one  takes  the  whole  episode  in  its  totality,  it  is"
"abundantly clear that only the appellant had the need to get rid of the deceased"
"and no one else, in order to get over the difficult situation he was facing."
"I find no basis for the argument that the learned High Court Judge has failed to"
"follow the principles that govern circumstantial evidence. Although the learned"
"High  Court  Judge  has  not  specifically  mentioned  about 
the  principles  of"
"circumstantial  evidence,  if  one  takes  care  to  read  the  judgement  in  full,  it"
"becomes  very  much  clear  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  was  very  much"
"mindful  of  the  evidence  he  must 
look  at  to  come  to  a 
finding  based  on"
"circumstantial  evidence.  He  has  well  considered  the  evidence 
in  order  to"
"determine whether the evidence points only towards the guilt of the accused and"
"nothing else. I do not find any basis to suggest that the circumstantial evidence"
"adduced in this action was inadequate to support the conviction."
"As I have stated before, the evidence taken together irresistibly points towards"
"the only inference that the accused committed the offence."
"Hence, I find no merit in the considered grounds of appeal."
"The  third  ground  of  appeal  preferred  by  the  learned  Counsel  was  that  the"
"prosecution has failed to eliminate the possibility of a third party being involved"
"in the crime. It appears that the basis for this argument is the involvement of"
"PW-01 and other villagers in initially taking steps to accompany the deceased to"
"the house of a village elder and steps taken by them to assist her in her hour of"
"need.  It  also  may  be  this  argument  is  based  on  the  suggestion  made  to  the"
"witnesses that it was PW-01 and others who are responsible for taking away the"
"deceased at that night. I find that this is a position that has no basis whatsoever."
"The evidence led in this action clearly establishes that other than the appellant,"
"no one else has had any hand in the death of the deceased. The question of the"
"possibility of a third party being the perpetrator of the crime was never a fact"
"that has come up during the trial. Therefore, I find no merit in the 3rd ground of"
"appeal as well."
