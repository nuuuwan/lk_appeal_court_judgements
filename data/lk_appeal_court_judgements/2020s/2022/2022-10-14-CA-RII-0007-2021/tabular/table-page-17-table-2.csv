"Gajadhar Singh v. Chunni & Ors. 1949 Cri LJ 967 it was held:"
"“Criminal Courts are not intended to be a sort of place for a preliminary skirmish so that"
"the successful party may have the advantage of driving the other side to the civil or the revenue"
"Court. During the last few days, I have had a large number of criminal references under Section"
"145, Criminal P. C., and I have noticed that this tendency to use Section 145 not with the object of"
"preventing a breach of the peace but with the object of getting possession of the property and"
"driving the other side to figure as plaintiff has become very common. The Magistrates must guard"
"themselves against the provisions of the section being thus abused, The reference is rejected.”"
