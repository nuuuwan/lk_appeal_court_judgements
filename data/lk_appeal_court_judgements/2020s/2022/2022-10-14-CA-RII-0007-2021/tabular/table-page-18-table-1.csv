"The case of Karunanayake (supra) concerned:"
"“…. the correctness and the validity of the decision of the learned Primary Court Judge to"
"summon the Grama Seva Niladhari and Y. L. Sumanaratne after fixing a date for the delivery of"
"the order in this case.”"
"His  Lordship  concluded  that  the  Primary  Court  Judge’s  decision  to  reopen  the"
"inquiry on possession and summon two witnesses ex mero motu, after having closed the"
"case and fixing the matter for judgment, was erroneous.  Such a procedure offends Section"
"72 of the Act which provides the material on which a determination or order may be made."
"In Ramalingam v. Thangarajah [1982] 2 SLR 693 his Lordship Sharvananda J. (as"
"he then was) held:"
"“Section 72 prescribes the material on which the determination and order under section 68"
"and 69 of the Act is to be based. The determination should, in the main, be founded on “the"
"i
nformation filed and the affidavits and documents furnished by the parties”. Adducing evidence"
"by way of affidavits and documents is the rule and oral testimony is an exception to be permitted"
"only at the discretion of the Judge. That discretion should be exercised judicially, only in a fit case"
"and not as a matter of course and not be surrendered to parties or their counsel. Under this section"
"the parties are not entitled as of right to lead oral evidence.”"
"It is interesting to note that although Section 72 provides that “a determination or"
"order under this part [Part VII] shall be made after examination and consideration of….”,"
"his Lordship Sharvananda J., as seen in the excerpt quoted above, observed that Section"
"72  applies  to  “determination  and  order  under  section  68  and  69”  without  mentioning"
"Section 66(2). Section 66(2) also provides for making a “determination or order on…. the"
"dispute  regarding  which  the 
information 
is 
filed” 
i.e. 
in  our  view, 
for  making  a"
"determination or order on a dispute affecting land owing to which a breach of the peace is"
"threatened or likely. Thereby, it is safe to presume that since Section 66(2) provides for a"
"determination or inquiry, and that Section 66(2) requires an inquiry to be conducted on"
"whether the two conditions are met."
"An  initial  inquiry  or  screening,  especially  when  information  is  received  from  a"
"disputing party, would enable that Magistrate to exercise that abundance of caution. In"
"the 
instant  case, 
inquiring  from  the  Police  about  the  reason  they  did  not  file  an"
"information would have aided the learned Magistrate in the task of determining whether"
"her Court is clothed with jurisdiction to inquire further into the matter. This is to enable"
"the  Magistrate  to  obtain  a  clearer  picture  of  the  actual  dispute  since  at  the  time  a"
