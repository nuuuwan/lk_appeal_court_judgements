"evidence properly and giving due weight to such evidence has arrived at"
"the correct conclusion."
"Hence, I answer the fourth question of law in the negative, in favour of the"
"Respondent."
"Is the amount of VAT and penalty payable, as confirmed by the TAC,"
"excessive, arbitrary and unreasonable?"
"As I have already stated above in this judgement, the Appellant, USL is the"
"real  manufacturer  of  the  Vim  scourer  bars  and  Signal  toothbrushes  and,"
"consequently,  the  Appellant  is  liable  to  VAT.  Although  the  Appellant"
"raised the aforementioned question of law on the excessive, arbitrary and"
"unreasonable assessment of VAT, the learned President’s Counsel for the"
"Appellant  did  not  elaborate  on  this  argument  and  no  separate  account"
"statements or any other such evidence in support of the claim was tendered."
"The burden is on the tax payer to disprove the correctness of an assessment"
"and to establish a lower figure. Although the dispute may be on the reasons"
"given by the Assessor for rejecting the return and making an assessment,"
"yet, the onus of disproving the estimate lies on the tax payer."
"Upon  perusing  the  Appellant’s  written  submissions,  it  appears  that  the"
"Appellant has not set out material in support of fourth question of law. In"
"these circumstances, I am unable to find that the assessment of VAT and"
"penalty  payable,  as  confirm  by  the  TAC,  are  excessive,  arbitrary  and"
"unseasonable."
"Accordingly, I answer the fourth question of law in the negative, in favour"
"of the Respondent."
"Did  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  err  in  law  when  it  came  to  the"
"conclusion that it did?"
"For the reasons  set out above  and having considered  the preceding  four"
"questions of law, I hold that the TAC did not err in law when it arrived at"
"the conclusion that it did."
"Accordingly, I answer the fifth question of law in the negative, in favour"
"of the Respondent."
"Conclusion"
"Thus, having considered all the arguments presented to this Court, I hold"
"that the TAC has not erred in arriving at its final determination."
