"Having argued extensively, as above, that the time limit specified for the"
"TAC  is  mandatory,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Appellant"
"submitted 
that  when 
the 
two-hundred-and-seventy-day 
time 
limit 
is"
"exceeded, the appeal stands abated. The practical effect would be that the"
"appeal is as good as allowed13."
"In  my  view,  the  submission  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the"
"Appellant  that  if  this  Court  were  to  hold  that  the  TAC  prevented  from"
"hearing  an  appeal  after 
the 
two-hundred-and-seventy-day  period  has"
"lapsed, the appeal should stand allowed is untenable. Should the State, and"
"in  general 
the  people  of 
this  country,  lose  revenue  or  the  taxpayers"
"themselves lose the opportunity of getting the relief because of the fault of"
"the TAC?"

"Don John Francis Liyanage,14 addresses the above issue, in the context of"
"the  time  limit  applicable  to  a  Fundamental  Rights  petition  before  the"
"Supreme Court of Sri Lanka:"
"‘These provisions confer a right on the citizen and a duty on the Court. If"
"that right was intended to be lost because the Court fails in its duty, the"
"Constitution would have so provided. It has provided no sanction of any"
"kind in case of such failure. To my mind, it was only an injunction to be"
"respected and obeyed but, fell short of punishment if disobeyed. I am of the"
"opinion  that  the  provisions  of  Article  126  (5)  are  directory  and  not"
"mandatory.  Any  other  construction  would  deprive  a  citizen  of  his"
"fundamental right for no fault of his (emphasis added).’"
"Sharvananda J. (as His Lordship then was) made a similar observation in"
"the  previously  cited  case  of  K.  Nagalingam  v.  Lakshman  de  Mel,15"
"regarding an order made by the Commissioner of Labour after the expiry"
"of a statutory time limit:"
"‘To hold that non-compliance with the time limit stipulated by section 2 (2)"
"(c)  renders  the  Commissioner's  order  of  approval  -  or  refusal  void  will"
"cause grave hardship to innocent parties. Parties who have done all that"
"the  statute  requires  of  them  should  not  lose  the  benefit  of  the  order"
