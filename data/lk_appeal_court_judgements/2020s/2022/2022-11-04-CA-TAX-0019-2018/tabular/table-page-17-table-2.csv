"‘“supply of services” means any supply which is not a supply of"
"goods  but  includes  any  loss  incurred  in  a  taxable  activity  for"
"which an indemnity is due;’"
"Accordingly, a taxable supply of goods or services made by a registered"
"person in the course of carrying on, or carrying out, of a taxable activity is"
"subject to VAT."
"However, Section 3 of the VAT Act sets out that the wholesale and retail"
"supply of goods are exempted from VAT unless the supply was made by a"
"manufacturer or by other categories of persons specified in the Section."
