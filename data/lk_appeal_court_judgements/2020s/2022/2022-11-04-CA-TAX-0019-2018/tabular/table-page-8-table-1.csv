"provides that the failure to determine an appeal within the specified time"
"limit should result in the appeal being allowed and tax charged accordingly."
"Inland  Revenue  Act  No.  24  of  2017,  which  is  in  force  as  at  now,  also"
"provides  for  an  Administrative  Review  of  an  assessment  by  the  CGIR."
"However, unlike in the previous Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, no"
"time frame has been specified in Section 139 for the CGIR to deliver his"
"decision. Nevertheless, Section 140 provides that within thirty days from"
"the date of the decision or upon lapse of ninety days from the request being"
"made  for  an  administrative  review,  the  tax  payer  is  entitled  to  make  an"
"appeal to the TAC. Hence, it is clear that while the breach of certain time"
"limits is accompanied by remedies or sanctions, the breach of others is not."
"It should be noted that, under Section 144 of the 2017 Act, if the TAC fails"
"either  to  determine  or  to  respond  to  an  appeal  filed  by  a  person  within"
"ninety days from the appeal request, the Appellant has the right to appeal"
"to the Court of Appeal."
"From the preceding analysis, it is clear that in the new Inland Revenue Act"
"No.  24  of  2017,  the  Legislature  has  removed  the  penal  consequences"
"previously imposed on the CGIR for failure to meet the statutory deadline."
"Nevertheless,  in  the  event  of  non-compliance,  the  Appellant  has  been"
"granted a remedy through a direct right of appeal to the TAC.  In addition,"
"upon  the  failure  of  the  TAC  to  respond  to  an  appeal  request  within  the"
"prescribed  time  frame,  the  Appellant  has  been  granted  a  direct  right  of"
"appeal to the Court of Appeal. Therefore, it can be seen that though the"
"Legislature  has  in  the  case  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  No.  24  of  2017,"
"introduced a remedy where the TAC fails to respond within the specified"
"time limit; in the case of the TAC Act, despite twice availing itself of the"
"opportunity to amend the law, the Legislature has not specified a remedy"
"in case of non-compliance."
"I am not unmindful of the fact that this particular question of law is on the"
"TAC Act. Yet, I am of the view that consideration of the above provisions"
"in the Inland Revenue Act are relevant, since those provisions manifest the"
"intention of the Legislature regarding the time limits imposed on the TAC."
"In light of the above, it is my considered view that the Legislature, although"
"has amended Section 10 of the TAC Act twice, intentionally refrained from"
"introducing a penal consequence and/or a remedy for the failure of the TAC"
