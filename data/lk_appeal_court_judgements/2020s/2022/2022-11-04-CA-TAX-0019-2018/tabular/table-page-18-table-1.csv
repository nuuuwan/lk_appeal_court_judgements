"The Appellant submitted that it is abundantly clear from the commercial"
"agreements between RMCC and PSL that the Appellant is not in any way"
"engaged in any of the activities within the term manufacture defined in the"
"VAT Act. On the contrary it was submitted that each and every activity"
"within  the  definition  of  the  term  manufacture  of  Vim  scourer  bars  and"
"Signal toothbrushes are carried out by RMCC and PSL."
"The Appellant contended that the question as to whether the Appellant is a"
"manufacturer for the purpose of the VAT Act must be determined solely"
"by reference to the definition in the VAT Act25. I do concede that the above"
"matter has to be decided within the scope of the VAT Act itself. Yet, as I"
"have 
already 
stated 
above 
in 
this 
judgement, 
although 
the  word"
"manufacture  is  defined  in  the  VAT  Act  the  word  manufacturer  is  not."
"However,  notably,  besides  the  words  supply  of  goods  and  supply  of"
"services  the  word  supplier  is  also  defined  separately.  In  my  view,  the"
"Legislature, 
in 
its  wisdom,  did 
so  deliberately,  allowing 
the  word"
"manufacturer to be interpreted in light of the facts of each case."
"The Appellant cited the following observations made by Hoffmann J., in"
"the case of Charter House Investment Trust v. Tempest Diesels Ltd26 . in"
"support of the above-mentioned argument, which reads as follows;"
"‘one must examine the commercial realities of the transaction and decide"
"whether it can properly be described as the going of financial assistance"
"by the company, bearing in mind that the section is a penal one and should"
"not be strained to cover transactions which are not fairly within it.’"
"Accordingly, it was submitted that when looking at transactions challenged"
"under a law, the Court must look to the commercial realities of what had"
"taken place."
"It was also cited the following comment made by Peter Smith J., in Anglo"
"Petroleum  Limited  and  Paul  Sutton  v.  TFB 
(Mortgages)  Limited27"
"regarding the aforementioned dictum of Hoffmann J.;"
"‘In effect what he is saying is that if a transaction has a lawful and bona"
"fide  purpose 
the  court  should  not  strain 
the  section 
to  render 
the"
"transactions illegal.’"
