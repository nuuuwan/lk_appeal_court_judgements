"Attention of the Court was drawn to the following extract from the case of"
"Sohli Captain v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue17;"
"‘(…) that express and unambiguous language is absolutely indispensable"
"in Statutes passed for the purpose of imposing a tax, for such a Statute is"
"always strictly construed."
"He  also  cited  The  Manager,  Bank  of  Ceylon,  Hatton  v.  The  Secretary"
"Hatton  Dickoya  Urban  Council18  wherein  the  following  extract  from"
"Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes 19 was reproduced."
"‘Statutes which impose pecuniary burdens, also, are  subject to the same"
"rule of strict construction. It is a well settled rule of law that all charges"
"upon  the  subject  must  be  imposed  by  clear  and  unambiguous  language"
"because of some decree they operate as penalties. The subject is not to be"
"taxed unless the languages of the statute clearly imposes the obligation.’"
"Further, the learned Counsel cited Vallibel Lanka (Pvt) Limited v. Director-"
"General  of  Customs  and  Three  Others20  and  reproduced  the  following"
"extract."
"‘it is the established rule in the interpretation of statutes levying taxes and"
"duties, not to extend the provisions of the statute by implication, beyond"
"the clear import of the language used or to enlarge their operation in order"
"to  embrace  matters  not  specifically  pointed  out.  In  case  of  doubt,  the"
"provisions are construed most strongly against the state and in favour of"
"the citizen.’"
"I fully agree with the learned Counsel that tax legislation that imposes taxes"
"should be interpreted strictly and the liability of tax must be imposed by"
"clear  and  unambiguous  language.  Also,  that  if  two  constructions  are"
"possible,  one  in  favour  of  the  Assessee  and  the  other  in  favour  of  the"
"Assessor, the Court must adopt a construction favourable to the Assessee."
"Nonetheless, upon a careful consideration of the language in Section 3 of"
"the  ESC,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  language  in  the  Section  is  clear  an"
"unambiguous  and  therefore,  the  question  of  two  constructions  will  not"
"arise."
