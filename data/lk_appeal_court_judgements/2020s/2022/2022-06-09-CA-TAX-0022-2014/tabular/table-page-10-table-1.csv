"N.S. Bindra21, cited the Privy Council decision in the case of Robertson v."
"Day22 wherein it was held that  ‘It is a legitimate rule of construction to"
"construe word in an Act of Parliament with reference to words found in"
"immediate connection with them’. Accordingly, I am of the view that the"
"word ‘receivable’ is used in Section 2 (3) (b) of the ESC Act to mean a"
"sum which is not actually received at the time but, outstanding. Therefore,"
"the  meaning  of  the  word  ‘receivable’  should  not  be  stretched  to  mean"
"anything  outside  the  scope  of  the  Section,  since  the  lawfulness  of  an"
"outstanding amount is not within the scope of the Section."
"In determining the turnover, the allowable deductions are also set out in the"
"Section  itself23.    Accordingly,  any  sum  which  should  be  paid  as  Value"

"provision. Provisos are often inserted to allay fears or misapprehension’."

"destruction by strike, riot, civil commotion, or acts of terrorism and paid"
"into  the  consolidated  fund  by  a  person  carrying  on  insurance  business"
"should not be considered as part of the turnover of such person."
"It is also provided that in case of a bank, the receipt of interest, discounts,"
"dividend, exchange, service charges, commissions, brokerage or any other"
"income out of their business should form part of its turnover. It is within"
"the  common  knowledge  that  apart  from  charging  interest  for  the  loans"
"granted  by  banks,  banks  also  pay  interest  to  their  depositors.  However,"
