"the  advertisements12.  Appellant’s  role  in  this  regard  is  only  introducing"
"clients to the media, for which the Appellant receives only a Commission"
"of 15 % out of the total turnover13."
"At this stage it is important to analyse the Appellant’s role. Admittedly the"
"Appellant is an advertising agent14. The Appellant designs advertisements"
"for  its  clients  which  need  to  be  published/communicated  to  the  people."
"According  to  the  Appellant,  since  the  Appellant  does  not  own  a  media"
"institution, the Appellant introduces those clients to the media. According"
"to the Appellant thereafter those clients become the clients of media. The"
"Appellant contended that upon ‘D 4’ and ‘D 6’, media have the right to"
"receive  the  dues  from  the  clients  and  the  clients  are  bound  to  make  the"
"payments to media. The Appellant argued that the demand made directly"
"from  the  clients  by  the  media  establishes  the  fact  that  the  clients  are  of"
"media and not of the Appellant. The document tendered by the appellant"
"with the motion dated 20th July 2015 is a summary of accounts, indicating"
"the amounts owed by the Appellant to the media as at 11th June 2011. The"
"media requests the Appellant to settle the identical amount stated in ‘D 6’,"
"within the credit period to avoid suspension of the credit facilities offered"
"to  the  Appellant.  Hence,  it  is  apparent  that  the  contract  is  between  the"
"Appellant and media and ‘D 4’ only guarantees the payment to the media"
"by  the  client,  in  the  event  the  Appellant  defaults.  Therefore,  initially,"
"payments to the media arise out of invoices issued by the Appellant and a"
"claim on the Letter of Guarantee will  only occur in the event of failure."
"Therefore,  in  my  view,  the  TAC  erred  in  holding  that  ‘D  4’  merely"
"authorizes the media institution to accept advertising materials furnished"
"by  the  Appellant  company  to  be  published  in  the  name  of  the  client."
"However, this misstatement of fact has not affected the final determination"
"of the TAC. Moreover, it is significant that in the letter of guarantee the"
"client has described the Appellant as their agent and not as the agent of"
"media, as stated by the Appellant. Further, in view of the above facts, it"
"appears to me that although the client has guaranteed payments to media"
"for advertising done in respect of their business, the Appellant is the one"
"who dealt with the media, acting as agent of the client."
"From the foregoing analysis of the facts, it seems to me that the clients who"
"wish  to  advertise  their  product/service  would  seek  the  assistance  of  the"
"Appellant who is an advertising agent. The designing of the advertisement,"
