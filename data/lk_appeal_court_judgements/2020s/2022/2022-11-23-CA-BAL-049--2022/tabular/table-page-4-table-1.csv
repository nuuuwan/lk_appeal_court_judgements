"is  considered  after  conviction  hence  the 
likelihood  of  the  accused"
"absconding is higher than in a case where trial is yet to commence, as"
"in  the  instant  matter.  The  document  marked  and  produced  by  the"
"petitioner as P4 says that the suspect suffers from psychotic features."
"This  Court  also  observe 
that  although 
investigations  had  been"
"concluded  (as  pleaded  by  the  State  Counsel)  State  Counsel  failed  to"
"state as to indictment would be filed against the suspect. Hence there"
"is an ambiguity pertaining to his period in remand which we consider is"
"a violation of the objective of this Act. It is very well known that the"
"above  mentioned  Act  has  been  enacted  to  safeguard  the  rights  of"
"witnesses  and  victims.  But  in  the  same  Act  it  has  been  stated  that"
"matters pertaining to this Act should be given precedence over others."
"But in the instant matter we do not see such a situation. As such the"
"instant  application  for  bail  is  allowed. 
  The  Learned  Magistrate  is"
"directed to enlarge the suspect on suitable conditions of bail on receipt"
"of this order without delay."
