"The  suspect 
in  the 
instant  matter  has  been  produced  before  the"
"Magistrate’s  Court  of  Kalawana  for  a  case  of  abduction  attempted"
"murder and causing grievous hurt. On 13.04.2022 the Kalawana Police"
"had received a complaint from Gayathri Ishara stating that the suspect"
"entered her house and threatened her with death in order to withdraw"
"the above mentioned case. The inmates of the house had corroborated"
"this 
incident.  The 
suspect  had  been  produced  under 
the  above"
"mentioned Act for the complaint made by Gayathri Ishara and he had"
"been  remanded  by  the  Magistrate  under  the  provisions  of  the  above"
"mentioned Act."
"The Counsel for the Suspect denied this allegation and stated that  the"
"document marked as P4 is a medical report of the suspect and that he is"
"undergoing a  depressive disorder  with  psychotic features, as  such he"
"urged Court to consider enlarging the suspect on bail."
"The  Counsel  appearing 
for 
the  Attorney  General  objected 
to 
this"
"application."
"Having considered the submissions of both parties, the law pertaining to"
"the instant Act is that once a suspect is produced under this Act bail can"
"be 
considered  only  by 
the  Court  of  Appeal  under  exceptional"
"Circumstance.  The  term  exceptional  has  not  been  defined 
in  the"
"statute, but in the many of our decided cases it has been concluded that"
"exceptionality  defers  from  case  to  case. 
In  the 
instant  matter  the"
"exceptionality  pleaded  is  the  mental  condition  of  the  suspect.  It  has"
"been decided in the case of Ram Thamodaranpille that the “ill health of"
"the accused can be considered only if the incarceration endangers his"
"life”, but we also note that in the case of Ramu Thamodarumpillai bail"
