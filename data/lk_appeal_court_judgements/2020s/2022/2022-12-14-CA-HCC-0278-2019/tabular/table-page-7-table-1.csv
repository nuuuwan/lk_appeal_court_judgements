"Professor  G.L.Peiris  in  his  book  “  Recent  Trends  in  the  Commonwealth"
"Law of Evidence” at page 311 states as follows:"
"“Where the evidence, viewed as whole, admits some degree of doubt,"
"this doubt may be reinforced by evidence of good character which, to"
"that extent, could facilitate an acquittal in marginal cases.”"
"The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had considered the defence"
"witnesses to come to his conclusion. The defence witness under whom the"
"Appellant was working as a driver gave evidence and had told the court that"
"the  appellant 
is  a  trustworthy  person  and  that  he  would  have  never"
"suspected  of  any  incident  of  this  nature  implicating  him  while  he  was"
"working under him. This defence witness’s evidence had been considered by"
"the Learned High Court Judge and he has given reasons in his judgment and"
"as  to  why  he  had  rejected  his  evidence.  The  relevant  paragraph  of  the"
"judgment is re-produced below:"
"(Page 204 of the brief.)"

"As this is not a marginal case as described above, and due to the aforesaid"
"reasons, I conclude that this ground of appeal also is also sans any merit."
