"pensive  mood.  Further  the  prosecutrix  was  a  person  with  a  lower  level  of"
"intelligence."
"The  Learned  Counsel  strenuously  argued  that  the  medical  evidence  given"
"with regard to the effect that there were no injuries to the hymen and also"
"the fact that the judicial medical officer had taken up the possibility of this"
"alleged rape taking place, by stating that he is not 100 percent certain as to"
"the  rape  being  committed,  creates  a  reasonable  doubt  with  regard  to  the"
"whole prosecution story."
"PW4, JMO in his evidence stated that although there were no injuries found"
"during the physical examination and that her hymen was intact, considering"
"the time lapse between the crime and the examination and the fact that the"
"prosecutrix had an extending type of hymen, there was the possibility of a"
"vaginal penetration."
"Explanation  (i)  to  Section  363  of  the  Penal  Code  as  amended  states  that"
"‘penetration is sufficient’ to constitute sexual intercourse. This means that it"
"is not necessary to prove that the sexual intercourse lasted longer or that the"
"man ejaculated."
"In  this  case  the  prosecutrix  was  consistent  in  her  evidence  about  the"
"happenings of the incident. She had vividly explained how she was raped by"
"the Appellant on the very first day. She had given evidence before the High"
"Court for more than 4 years after the incident. The Learned High Court Judge"
"accurately analysed the evidence before he accepted the that of the victim as"
"true and cogent. Hence this ground of appeal has no merit."
"In the third ground of appeal the Counsel for the Appellant contended that"
"failure on the part of the Court to observe the evidence which confirmed the"
"reason for animosity and the complaint made."
"During the argument the Counsel for the Appellant took up the stance that"
"a long-standing boundary dispute between these two families had instigated"
"the prosecutrix’s family to make a false complaint against the Appellant."
