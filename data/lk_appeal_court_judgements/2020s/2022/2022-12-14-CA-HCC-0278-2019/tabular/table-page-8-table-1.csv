"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  in  the  judgment  had  considered  all  the"
"evidence adduced by the prosecution and the defence and had given reasons"
"as  to  why  he  acted  on  the  evidence  adduced  by  the  prosecution.  He  has"
"accurately analysed all the evidence presented by both parties with correct"
"perspective and arrived at the correct finding."
"Hence, I am of the view that the prosecution had proved the 1st count against"
"the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, I affirm the conviction and"
"sentence  imposed  on  him  with  regard  to  the  1st  count.  I  further  order  the"
"sentence imposed on the 1st count to be operative from the date of conviction"
"namely 11/09/2019."
"The appeal is, therefore, dismissed."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the"
"High Court of Gampaha along with the original case record."
