"S
ome of the proven facts are consistent with the innocence of the appellant and"
"also not consistent with the guilt of the appellant."
"Under  these  circumstances,  it  is  necessary  for  the  prosecution  to  exclude  the"
"possibility  of  suicide.  Failure  to  exclude  this  possibility  creates  a  reasonable"
"doubt in the prosecution case."
"In  this  case,  there  are  no  eye  witnesses  to  the  incident.    The  case  entirely"
"depends on circumstantial evidence."
"In the case of King vs Abeywickrema 44 NLR 254, it was held that; “in order to"
"base  a  conviction  on  circumstantial  evidence  the  Jury  must  be  satisfied  that"
"the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with"
"any reasonable hypothesis of his innocence.”"
"In the case of Podi Singho vs King 53 NLR, Dias J.  held as follows: “in a case of"
"circumstantial  evidence,  such  evidence  must  be  totally  inconsistent  with  the"
"innocence of the accused and must only be consistent with his guilt.”"
"In the case of Don Sunny vs Attorney General[1998] 2 Sri LR 1, it was held as"
"follows:"
"1. When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the proved"
"items  of  circumstantial  evidence  when  taken  together  must  irresistibly  point"
"towards  the  only  inference  that  the  accused  committed  the  offence.  On  a"
"consideration  of  all  the  evidence  the  only  inference  that  can  be  arrived  at"
"should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only."
"2. If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence if an inference"
"can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, then one"
"cannot say that the charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt."
