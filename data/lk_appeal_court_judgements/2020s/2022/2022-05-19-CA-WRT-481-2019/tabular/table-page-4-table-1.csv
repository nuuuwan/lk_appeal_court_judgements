"3.  The Petitioner has no basis to support the application and has not demonstrated"
"any ultra-vires on the part of the Respondents warranting the issuance of the"
"Writ of Certiorari."
"Observation and determination."
"The  construction  of  a  220Kv  transmission  line  from  Habarana  to  Veyangoda  is  a"
"National Project. It has been borne out from the documents marked R1 and R1a that"
"the  Petitioner  had  been  served  with  a  notice  dated  07-12-2011  in  terms  of  the"
"provisions  of 
the  Sri-Lanka  Electricity  Act  No.  20  of  2009  pertaining 
to 
the"
"construction of an electricity tower on the land claimed by the Petitioner with regard"
"to the said national Project. The Petitioner had not raised any objections within the"
"stipulated time period. Hence, on 12-12-2017 the 2nd Respondent had commenced"
"the work."
"On 15-08-2019, the Petitioner, by way of an email had informed the 3rd Respondent"
"that  the  excavation  work  being  done  in  his  land  is  without  his  permission,  and"
"therefore,  the  same  should  be  terminated  (R6).  In  view  of  the  obstruction  of  the"
"Petitioner 
to 
the  Project, 
the  Ceylon  Electricity  Board 
sought 
the  necessary"
"intervention of the 1st Respondent by letters dated 15-08-2019 and 23-08-2019 (R7"
"and R8). Accordingly, by letter dated 18-09-2019 the 1st Respondent had summoned"
"the  Petitioner  for  an  inquiry  pertaining  to  the  dispute,  whereas  the  latter  failed  to"
"respond to the said letter. Thereupon, the 1st Respondent by letter dated 02-10-2019"
"authorized the 2nd and 3rd Respondents for the completion of the Project (R11a/P12)."
"When the Petitioner had submitted to the 1st Respondent documents to establish his"
"ownership to the land on which the construction is being carried on, the matter was"
"once  again  fixed  for  an  inquiry/field  inspection,  which  was  also  cancelled  as  the"
"Petitioner refused to attend the same (R12 and R13)."
"Having  scrutinized  the  documents  tendered, 
it 
is  abundantly  clear  that  the  1st"
"Respondent had given adequate opportunities to the Petitioner to establish his claim,"
"and  the  Petitioner  failed  to  make  use  of  said  opportunities.  The  impugned  letter"
"marked R11a/P12 is within the purview of the provisions of the Sri-Lanka Electricity"
"Act No. 20 of 2009. As such, the position taken up by the Petitioner as to the ultra-"
"v
i
res and violation of natural justice on the part of the Respondents is devoid of merits."
"Moreover,  it  is  to  be  noted  that  there  is  no  evidence  before  Court  to  establish  the"
"purported  claim  of 
the  Petitioner 
that 
the  disputed  electricity 
tower 
is  being"
"constructed on his land. This fact has been admitted by the Petitioner in paragraph"
"07 of his affidavit, which reads;"
