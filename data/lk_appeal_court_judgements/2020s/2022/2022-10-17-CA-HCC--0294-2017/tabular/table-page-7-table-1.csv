"In this case, the evidence given by the PW1 is tainted with uncertainty and"
"ambiguity and it certainly does not pass the probability test."
"Therefore, I conclude that the prosecution had  not  succeeded in adducing"
"highly  incriminating  evidence  against  the  Appellant  and  thereby  has  not"
"established the charge beyond reasonable doubt."
"Taking into consideration all these circumstances, I am of the view that the"
"conviction  of  the  Appellant  cannot  be  allowed  to  stand  as  the  prosecution"
"had  failed  to  prove  the  case  beyond  all  reasonable  doubt.  The  Appeal  is"
"allowed and the Appellant is acquitted from the charge."
"The appeal is allowed."
"The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the"
"High Court of Kurunegala along with the original case record."
