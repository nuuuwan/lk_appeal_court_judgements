"through a direct right of appeal to the TAC, and upon the failure of the TAC"
"to  respond  to  such  an  appeal  request  within  the  specified  time  limit,  the"
"Appellant has been granted a direct right of appeal to the Court of Appeal."
"Therefore, it can be seen that though the Legislature has in the case of  the"
"Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017, introduced a remedy where the TAC fails"
"to respond within the specified time limit. However, in the case of the TAC"
"Act,  despite  twice  availing  itself  of  the  opportunity  to  amend  the  law,  the"
"Legislature has not specified a remedy in case of non-compliance."
"In light of the above, it is my considered view that the Legislature, although"
"it has amended Section 10 of the TAC Act twice, intentionally refrained from"
"introducing a penal consequence and/or a remedy for the failure of the TAC"
"to comply with the specified time limit. Therefore, I am not in favour of the"
"argument forwarded by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, that the fact"
"that the Legislature has amended Section 10 twice means that it intended the"
"time limit contained therein to be mandatory."
"Having argued extensively, as above, that the time limit specified for the TAC"
"is mandatory, the learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that when the"
"two hundred and seventy day time limit is exceeded, the returns submitted by"
"the Appellant shall take effect, thus nullifying both the Assessor’s assessment"
"and the CGIR’s confirmation of the said assessment."
"In my view, this submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that if"
"this Court were to hold that the TAC is functus officio in determining an appeal"
"after  the  two  hundred  and  seventy  day  period  has  lapsed,  the  assessment"
"should be rendered void and the return submitted by the Appellant should take"
"effect, is untenable. Should the State, and at large the citizens of this country,"
"lose revenue or the taxpayers themselves lose the opportunity to be allowed"
"the relief sought due to the fault of the TAC?"
