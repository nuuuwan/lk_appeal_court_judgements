"Furthermore, it is my considered opinion that the export of bunker fuel, which"
"would  be  consumed  by  a  ship  during  its  journey,  is  different  from  the"
"traditional  export  of  cargo  where  the  goods  are  exported  to  a  specified"
"recipient in an overseas destination."
"T
he Appellant contended that the intention of the Legislature in introducing"
"the legislative provisions relevant to this case is not fiscal, but economic, and"
"was  to  increase  foreign  reserves  by  encouraging  exports,  which  in  return"
"brings in foreign exchange. Therefore, it was submitted that the Appellantâ€™s"
"sale of bunker fuel, a transaction in foreign currency, constitutes an export."
"H
owever, in my view this may be one of several criteria which could be taken"
"into consideration in deciding whether a transaction is an export or not but,"
"not the decisive factor. There may be many more local transactions done in"
"foreign currency, which would not constitute an export."
