"establish  the  entitlement  to  the  exemption,  and  in  whose  favour  the  Court"
"should hold when there is a doubt or an ambiguity."
"Therefore, before reaching the juncture where the standard upon which the"
"exemption is established is decided, the Appellant first has to establish his"
"entitlement, which is an endeavour the Appellant has failed in."
"Conclusion"
"In the above analysis, it is my considered view that for a supply of bunker fuel"
"to be an export, it should be made to a ship leaving the territory of Sri Lanka."
"Official documents such as the Customs Declaration Form (CUSDEC), the"
"Marine Delivery Note, and the Commercial Invoice etc., where the place of"
"destination is stated, are relevant in determining whether the ship is going out"
"of Sri Lanka or not. In fact, the Respondent has raised this issue in their written"
"submission filed in this Court by stating that the contracts entered into by the"
"Appellant do not provide for a terminus outside the territorial waters of Sri"
"Lanka55. The ship/vessel being a non-resident ship/vessel should not be the"
"test in determining this fact, since, there may be non-resident ships, registered"
"in  a  foreign  country,  providing  services  within  the  Sri  Lankan  territory."
"However, it is unfortunate that in the case in hand, none of these documents"
"were produced. It appears that even the Respondent, the CGIR, has not taken"
"any  step  under  Section  215  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  to  search  for  these"
"documents. Nevertheless, since the Appellant is claiming a tax exemption in"
"this case, the burden lies on the Appellant to establish its eligibility for the"
"said exemption."
"The issue as to whether the Appellant satisfies the requirement imposed by"
"Sections  13  (b)  (iii)  and/or  Section  52  will  not  arise  since  this  Court  has"
"already determined that the Appellant has failed to establish that the supply of"
"bunker fuel by the Appellant to the ships constitutes an export."
"However, I wish to emphasise that this decision is limited to this case, and in"
"a  case  where  the  taxpayer  establishes  that  bunker  fuel  has  indeed  been"
"exported, by producing the necessary documents where the destination of the"
"ship is indicated (as specified above), the Appellant may be entitled to claim"
"the exemption under the relevant Section or Sections."
