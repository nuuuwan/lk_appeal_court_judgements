"The Indian Supreme Court has also observed in the case of  Novopan India"
"Ltd v. Collector of Central Excise and Customs51, that:"
"“(…) that a person invoking an exception or an exemption provision to relieve"
"him of the tax liability must establish clearly that he was covered by the said"
"provision. In case of doubt or ambiguity, benefit of it must go to the State.”"
"In  Commissioner  of  Central  Excise  v.  Hari  Chand  Shri  Gopal52,  it  was"
"observed that:"
"“A  person  who  claims  exemption  or  concession  has  to  establish  that  he  is"
"entitled  to  that  exemption  or  concession…  A  provision  providing  for  an"
"exemption, concession or exception, as the case may be, has to be construed"

"ambiguity used upon which the claim to the exemption is founded. It has been"
"said that a well-founded doubt is fatal to the claim; no implications will be"
"indulged  in  for  the  purpose  of  construing  the  language  used  as  giving  the"

"clearly expressed intention of the taxing power."
"At first, it appears that there is a conflict of opinions expressed by the Indian"
"Courts. However, on closer scrutiny, I agree that there is no real contradiction."
"The opinion expressed in the case of  The Government of Kerala v. Mother"
