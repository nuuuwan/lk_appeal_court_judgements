"Hence, I am of the view that it is unsafe to rely on the interpretations given in","",""
"other statutes to the word ‘export’, especially in interpreting a fiscal statute","",""
"enacted for fiscal purposes. Therefore, on the available material, I will proceed","",""
"to decide this matter within the words of the Inland Revenue Act itself.","",""
"The  Legislature","itself  has  recognized","that  petroleum  gas  or  petroleum"
"products are products exported from Sri Lanka. Being a country, which does","",""
"not  have  petroleum  resources,  it  is  obvious  that  the  export  of  petroleum","",""
"products referred to in Section 42 (1) (b) has to be the export of petroleum","",""
"products imported and then re-exported. However, it is a known factor that","",""
"Sri Lanka does not re-export petroleum products to other countries. Therefore,","",""
"invariably, the export meant by section 42 (1) (b) has to be the supplies made","",""
"to ships and/or air crafts etc.","",""
"Further, it is easily perceived that the ships arriving in Sri Lankan ports for","",""
"fuel do not take fuel on board for export, but for their own consumption. The","",""
"bunker  fuel  pumped  into  a  ship  will  be  consumed  by  that  ship  during  its","",""
"journey, and it may sometimes be the case that if that ship stays within the","",""
"territorial waters of Sri Lanka for a significant period of time, it will consume","",""
"that fuel within Sri Lankan territory itself, before reaching its final destination","",""
"or even before entering international waters. In the above circumstances, I am","",""
"of  the  view  that  having  a  specific  recipient  and/or  importer  to  receive  the","",""
"goods  abroad  is  not  an  appropriate  test  in  deciding  whether  the  supply  of","",""
"bunker fuel is an export or not.","",""
"In the written submissions filed in this case the Appellant contended that the","",""
"destination need not be another country, but could be any place outside Sri","",""
"Lanka including international waters. However, I am unable to agree with the","",""
"learned Counsel since a ship could not stay at sea forever without reaching a","",""
"port to take on supplies such as fuel etc.","",""
"T
he 
learned  Counsel  for","","the  Appellant  advanced  an  argument 
that 
the"
"Appellant’s possessing of a licence issued under Section 5B of the Ceylon","",""
"Petroleum Corporation Act should itself establish the fact that the Appellant","",""
"is an exporter of petroleum products sold to ships. However, along with the","",""
"word ‘export’, the words ‘sell’, ‘supply’ and ‘distribute’ also  appear in this","",""
"Section as alternatives. Therefore, the licence issued to the Appellant cannot","",""
"conclusively  be  upheld  as  an  export  license.  Hence,  I  am  of  the  view  that","",""
