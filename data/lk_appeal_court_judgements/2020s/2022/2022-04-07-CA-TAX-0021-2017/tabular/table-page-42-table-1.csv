"The Appellant cited the judgment of this Court in the case of Nanayakkara v."
"University of Peradeniya49 wherein S. N. Silva J., (as he  was then) held as"
"follows regarding the manner in which a tax exemption must be interpreted:"
"“A necessary corollary of applying the rule of strict construction to determine"
"liability under a taxing statute, is that any provision granting an exemption"
"from such liability is to be given its full effect. Exemptions are provided for by"
"the Legislature for the purpose of giving a measure of relief to a person who"
"would  otherwise  be  liable  to  tax  under  the  general  rule.  Therefore,  no"
"restriction should be placed on such provisions by way of interpretation so as"
"to defeat the purpose of granting such exemption.”"
"The view expressed by our Courts in the above case and in a line of authorities"
"is that tax exemptions should also be strictly interpreted as when compared"
"with other provisions of a taxing statute."
"However,  the  Appellant,  citing  the  following  extract  from  the  more  recent"
"decision of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of The Government of Kerala"
"v. Mother Superior Adoration Convent50, argued that exemptions claimed by"
"taxpayers are ‘beneficial and promotional exemptions’ and therefore, have to"
"be liberally interpreted:"
"“[…]  the  rule  regarding  exemptions is that  exemption  should  generally  be"
"strictly 
interpreted  but  beneficial  exemptions  having 
their  purpose  as"
"encouragement  or  promotion  of  certain  activities 
should  be 
liberally"
"interpreted. This composite rule is not stated in any particular judgment in so"
"many words. In fact, majority of the judgements emphasise that exemptions"
"are to be strictly interpreted while some of them insist that exemptions in fiscal"
"statues are to be liberally interpreted giving an apparent impression that they"
"are contradictory to each other. But this is only apparent. A close scrutiny"
"will reveal that there is no real contradiction amongst the judgements at all."
"The  synthesis  of  the  views  is  quite  clearly  that  the  general  rule  is  strict"
"interpretation  while  special  rule  in  the  case  of  beneficial  and  promotional"
"exemption  is  liberal  interpretation.  The  two  go  very  well  with  each  other"
"because they related to two different sets of circumstances.”"
