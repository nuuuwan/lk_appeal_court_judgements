"E.R.S.R.  Coomaraswamy  in  his  book  The  Law  of  Evidence,  Volume  I,  at"
"page 466 gives the summary of conditions of admissibility under section 32(1)"
"in the following manner;"
"In Sri Lanka, the conditions of admissibility may said to be:"
"(1) Death of the declarant before the proceedings."
"(2) The  statement  must  relate  to  the  cause  of  his  death  or  any  of  the"
"circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death."
"(3) The case must be such that the cause  of the declarant’s death must"
"come into question."
"(4) The competency of the declarant to testify may have to be established,"
"depending  upon  circumstances  of  each  case,  but  strict  rules  of"
"competency do not apply."
"(5) The  statement  must  be  a  complete  verbal  statement,  though  it  may"
"take the form of question and answer or appropriate gestures. It must"
"be complete in itself and capable of definite meaning."
"At  page  469,  citing  several  decided  cases,  Coomaraswamy  discusses  the"
"probative  value  of  evidence, 
infirmities  of  such  evidence, 
the  necessary"
"directions, in the following manner;"
"‘The  probative  value  of  dying  declarations  relevant  under  section  32(1)"
"would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But there is"
"no  doubt  that  such  evidence  suffers  from  certain  intrinsic  infirmities."
"Two of these defects are the fact that the statement was not made under"
"oath  and 
the  absence  of  cross-examination  of 
the  deponent  of 
the"
"statement.’"
"The 
following  matters  require  consideration 
in  regard  to  the  proper"
"directions:"
