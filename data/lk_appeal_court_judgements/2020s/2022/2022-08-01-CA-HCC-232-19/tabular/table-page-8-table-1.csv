"documents have been used by the appellant. As explained previously,"
"the only other evidence adduced in this case does not infer that the"
"appellant used forged documents but creates only a suspicion. In view"
"of the decisions of the aforesaid judicial authorities, I regret that I am"
"unable  to  agree  with  the  contention  of  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor"
"General that the expertâ€™s evidence and opinion could be considered as"
"conclusive proof."
