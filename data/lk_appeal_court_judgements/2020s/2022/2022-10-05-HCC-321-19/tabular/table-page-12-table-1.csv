"carrying  a  pistol.  Therefore, 
the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  was"
"perfectly correct in deciding that the facts of the appellant chasing the"
"deceased with the first accused who shot the deceased, the appellant"
"also carrying a pistol, and the appellant fleeing from that place with"
"the first accused draw only the inference as to the appellant’s common"
"murderous  intention.  In  addition,  the  facts  that  pistols  and  hand"
"grenades were possessed by both the accused, and that the deceased"
"was shot by the first accused using the pistol he carried, clearly show"
"the pre-arrangement for the murder. The appellant’s mental sharing"
"of  the  common  murderous  intention  with  the  first  accused  is  also"
"precisely clear by the appellant’s act of chasing the deceased with the"
"first accused even after the deceased was shot."
"It  is  also  important  to  note  that  even  if  two  people  assault  someone"
"and that person dies as a result of the assault, both assailants may"
"not be liable for murder on the basis of having a common murderous"
"intention  because  one  assailant  may  have  had 
the  murderous"
"intention and the other may not have had the murderous intention but"
"only to injure him. However, the case before us is different. Chasing"
"the deceased who was shot and injured signifies that both of them had"
"the  only  intention  of  killing  him.  Hence,  I  hold  that  the  common"
"murderous intention of the appellant has been established in this case."
"Conclusion"
"For the reasons stated above, I hold that the learned High Court Judge"
"has correctly convicted and sentenced the appellant for the offence of"
"murder.  Before  concluding,  I  should  state  that  the  judgment  of  the"
"learned High Court Judge is a well-considered judgment after carefully"
"and  correctly  considering  all  aspects  of 
the  case  and  properly"
"evaluating  all  evidence  in  the  case.  Therefore,  I  find  no  reason  to"
"interfere with the judgment."
