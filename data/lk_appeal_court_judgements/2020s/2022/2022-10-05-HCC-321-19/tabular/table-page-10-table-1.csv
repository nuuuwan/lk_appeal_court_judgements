"circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent"
"with their innocence."
"As  previously  stated,  the  evidence  of  the  Assistant  Judicial  Medical"
"Officer and the Government Analyst leads to the conclusion that the"
"gunshot injuries of the deceased were caused by the pistol possessed"
"by  the  first  accused.  The  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the"
"appellant  was  that  according  to  the  Government  Analyst’s  evidence,"
"there  was  no  firing  with  the  pistol  purportedly  possessed  by  the"
"appellant. Therefore, the learned counsel contended that the common"
"murderous intention of the appellant has not been established."
"According  to  the  testimony  of  PW-8  and  PW-13,  after  hearing  the"
"gunshots,  the  appellant  and  the  first  accused  chased  the  deceased."
"They  chased him  while  carrying  pistols.  So,  it  is  obvious that  the"
"appellant's presence there was a participatory presence and not a mere"
"presence. In the case of  Wasalamuni Richard v. The State - 76 NLR"
"534  at  page  546  it  was  held  “that  in  the  absence  of  an  explanation"
"from Premadasa, jury were entitled to draw the reasonable inference"
"from  all  the  circumstances  that  his  presence  at  the  scene  was  a"
"“participatory  presence”  as  distinct  from  a  “mere  presence”  which"
"would  have  entitled  him  to  an  acquittal.”  In  other  words,  the  said"
"decision  implies  that  if  it  is  not  a  “mere  presence”  and  if  it  is  a"
"“participatory presence”, the accused is not entitled to an acquittal."
"In the same judgment, it is also stated as follows; “The 3rd accused was"
"present at the scene of the crime. Even if the  evidence of assault by"
"the 3rd accused on the deceased is not considered, the fact of the 3rd"
"accused  absconding  after  the  incident  and  hiding  the  gun  that  was"
"used and the fact of his silence against all this evidence would make"
"the court draw an inference against the accused with regard to a pre-"
"arranged plan with the 1st and the 2nd accused”."
