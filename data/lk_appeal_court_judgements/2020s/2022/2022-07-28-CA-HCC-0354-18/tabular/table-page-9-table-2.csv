"harrowing  experience  and  would  like  to  forget  about  the  incident  as"

"allowed to capitalize or take mean advantage of these natural inherent"
"weaknesses of small children."
"(b) If the evidence of the victim could be relied on as trustworthy, firm etc."
"there is no impediment on the part of the Court in acting solely on the"
"evidence of the victim and only when the evidence of the victim suffers"
"from some infirmity or where the Court believe that it would be prudent"
"to base a conviction solely on that evidence, the Court should look for"
"corroboration."
