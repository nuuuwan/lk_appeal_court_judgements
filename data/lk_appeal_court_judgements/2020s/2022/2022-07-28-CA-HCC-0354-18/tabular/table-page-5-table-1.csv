"In  his  evidence-in-chief,  apart  from  saying  that  these  incidents  happened  in"
"2005, child has not been able to give a definite date or month where the incidents"
"took place. However, under cross-examination by the Counsel for the appellant,"
"the child has admitted that he met the appellant in May 2005 and the incidents"
"happened  thereafter.  This  well  explains  the  time  period  mentioned 
in  the"
"indictment as the period where the offences have been committed. The child has"
"given his evidence before the High Court on 2nd February 2012 which was 7 years"
"after the incident, and he was a youth of 20 years of age at that time. It is clear"
"from the evidence that the child has not been able to give a definite time period"
"in relation to the months and dates because he has forgotten such details several"
"years after the incidents."

"accompany the appellant on several occasions and to stay away from his home"
"on some nights, because the appellant wanted the child to accompany him  to"
"various places in the pretext of helping. Allowing the appellant to accompany the"
"child on a trip to Katharagama was one such occasion. PW-02 has explained the"

"informed him of the sexual abuse he had to face at the hands of the appellant."
"He has been specific that he did not ask detailed questions from the child with"
"regard  to  the  abuses  he  had  to  face,  but  it  was  the  police  officers  who  took  a"
"detailed statement from the child. He has been firm in his evidence that he did"
"not ask for much detail from the child and even at the time of giving evidence he"
"was  unaware  of  the  details  of  what  happened  to  his  child  other  than  he  was"
