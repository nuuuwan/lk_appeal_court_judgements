"3rd Ground of Appeal: -"
"Although it was the argument that the evidence has revealed malice towards the"
"appellant and that fact has not drawn the attention of the learned High Court"
"Judge, I am unable to find a basis for such an argument."
"It  is  clear  from  the  evidence  that  the  victim  child  and  his  family  members,"
"including the father of the victim has trusted the appellant, although they have"
"had reason to doubt as to whether he can help them in the way he has claimed."
"The father has allowed the boy to go with him freely without ever suspecting that"
"his son would be subjected to sexual abuse."
"The father has made a prompt complaint to the police when the child  informed"
"him that he is being sexually abused by the appellant. It is not possible to believe"
"that the father has made a false complaint against the appellant because he had"
"malice towards him in the absence of any evidence which directs towards such"
"a conclusion. I find no merit in the 3rd ground of appeal either."
"At  this  juncture,  I  would  like  to  draw  my  attention  to  the  argument  that  the"
"appellant has not been afforded a fair trial  because of the learned High Court"
"Judgeâ€™s failure to evaluate the evidence in the manner required in a judgment."
"It is clear from the opening comments by the learned High Court Judge in his"
"judgment, that the learned High Court Judge was well possessed of the relevant"
"legal  principles  that  a  trial  judge  should  bear  in  mind  when  considering  the"
"evidence in a case. After summarizing the evidence of each witness, the learned"
"High  Court  Judge  has  considered  whether  the  evidence  can  be  believed  and"
"whether the trustworthiness and the consistency of the witness has been dented"
"in any manner."
"Thereafter, the learned High Court Judge has considered the defence put forward"
"by  the  appellant,  and  has  rejected  the  same  on  the  basis  that  it  cannot  be"
"accepted."
