"As  such,  the  legislature  has  unequivocally  cast  a  burden  on  a  claimant  of  a"
"vehicle inquiry under the Forest Ordinance to dispense the burden of proving to"
"the  satisfaction  of  the  Court  that  he/she,  having  ownership  of  the  vehicle"
"concerned, had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such vehicle for the"
"commission of the offence. Hence, the primary contention to be decided by this"
"Court  is  whether  the  learned  Magistrate  has  correctly  evaluated  the  evidence"
"placed before him when arriving at the final determination that the petitioner has"
"failed to dispense the said burden."
"The learned Magistrate, in delivering the impugned order, has firstly examined"
"whether  the  petitioner  has  sufficiently  established  ownership  to  the  vehicle,"
"which is followed by an evaluation of the submissions made by the petitioner in"
"relation to the precautionary steps taken by him. Even if the Amendment No. 65"
"of  2009  has  not  been  mentioned  by  name,  the  requirement  in  the  proviso  to"
"Section 40(1) of the owner of the vehicle having to take all necessary precautions"
"to prevent the commission of an offence, has been adequately discussed by the"
"learned Magistrate and thereafter by the learned High Court Judge."
"The learned Magistrate has also referred to certain omissions and contradictions"
"in the evidence tendered by the petitioner to hold that the petitioner has failed to"
"satisfactorily dispense the burden cast on him under the proviso to Section 40(1)."
