"Both the learned Magistrate and  the  learned High Court Judge  have identified"
"that comprehensive instructions have been given and steps have been taken by"
"the  petitioner,  by  his  own  admission,  only  to  prevent  the  usual  driver  of  the"
"vehicle, one Gangodage Lal from using the vehicle to undertake any unauthorized"
"and illegal activities. No such instructions were given, nor steps taken when the"
"petitioner left a property which he so meticulously attended to,  with his  friend"
"Nilantha. The petitioner has only asked the accused Nilantha, to inform him if"
"the  driver  requests  the  vehicle  in  his  absence,  and  has  never  instructed  the"
"accused not to use it for any adverse purpose. And no credible reason has been"
"alluded to by the petitioner as to the necessity of leaving the vehicle along with"
"the key with the accused, as opposed to with the usual driver or at the owner’s"
"home. The petitioner only pleads his ignorance of such use of his vehicle by the"
"accused. However, this does not suffice to satisfy the Court of the high standard"
"of care expected from an owner that all precautions have been taken to avert the"
"very incident that has transpired."
"Further contradictions are evident when perusing the evidence tendered by the"
"petitioner at the Magistrate’s Court.  At  the  examination-in-chief, the petitioner"
"has  denied  that  he  usually  hands  over  the  vehicle  to  the  accused  when  the"
"petitioner is away, and has denied that the accused has ever driven the vehicle"
"before  (page  104  of  the  Appeal  Brief).  However,  at  the  re-examination,  the"
"petitioner has contradicted himself by stating that he usually leaves the vehicle"
"in the care of the accused (page 114 of the Appeal Brief). The petitioner has not"
"presented additional evidence to corroborate his stance. This raises a question"
"as to the bona fides of the petitioner and tilts the scale of balance of probability"
"in detriment to the petitioner."
"As per the precedent set by the vast body of case law, the crux of the matter in"
"such cases revolves    upon whether or not the owner of a vehicle successfully"
"satisfies the Court that he/she has taken all necessary precautions to  prevent"
"the misuse of their vehicle on a balance of probability favourable to them."
"As  held  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  The  Finance  Company  PLC  v.  Agampodi"
