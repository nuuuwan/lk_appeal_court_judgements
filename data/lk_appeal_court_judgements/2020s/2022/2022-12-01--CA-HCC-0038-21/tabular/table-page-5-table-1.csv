"T
herefore, the prosecution relies on PW-3â€™s evidence in establishing the"
"charge in the absence of any eyewitness to the incident of the shooting."
"According to the JMO, death occurred as a result of injury No-9, which"
"was caused by firing from a very close distance. The JMO expressed his"
"opinion that it should be a distance like two feet (pages 331 and 332 of"
"the  appeal  brief).  Hence,  it  is  apparent  that  the  person  who  shot  the"
"deceased should have been in very close proximity to him."
