"Therefore, I hold that the learned High Court Judgeâ€™s decision to convict"
"the appellant for the offence of murder is bad in law. Accordingly, I set"
"aside the judgment dated 20.07.2021, the conviction, and the sentence"
"imposed  on  the  appellant.  The  appellant  is  acquitted  of  the  charge"
"against him."
