"2.  Evidence  on  record  warrant  the  benefit  of  the  grave  and  sudden"
"provocation to the accused appellant."
"It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the appellant"
"had  not  denied  the  incident  and  the  evidence  of  PW-01,  the  only  eye  witness"
"clearly  suggests  that  there  was  a  provocation  for  the  appellant  to  act  in  the"
"manner the witness stated in her evidence. It was her position that the appellant"
"has well explained the provocation and the mental faculty in his dock statement,"
"which should have been considered in favour of the appellant."
"It  was  also  her  position  that  the  evidence  clearly  suggests  that  there  was  no"
"preplan by the appellant when this incident occurred, which also should have"
"been considered by the learned High Court Judge and the conviction should have"
"been in terms of section 297 of the Penal code on the basis of grave and sudden"
"provocation."
"The learned DSG was of the view that the eyewitness account of the incident by"
"PW-01 provides no basis to consider the actions of the deceased was a result of"
"a grave and sudden provocation of him by the deceased. He also points out that"
"the appellant has failed to set up a defence on such a basis, nor has he claimed"
"that he was suffering from a mental ailment at that time until he has referred to"
"such an ailment in his dock statement. However, he points to the fact that the"
"learned High Court  Judge has well considered both these scenarios,  although"
"they do not go in hand in hand."
"The learned DSG also separately pointed out the evidence of PW-01 where she"
"has been every categorical as to the part played by the appellant which shows"
"no  provocation  by  the  deceased  towards  the  appellant,  for  him  to  claim  the"
"benefit of exception 1 of section 294 of the Penal Code."
