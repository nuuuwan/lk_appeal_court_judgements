"After the closure of the prosecution case the learned Judge called for the defence. 1st and 2nd"
"accused-appellants had given evidence from the witness box. Two witnesses had been called"
"on behalf of the 1st accused-appellant."
"The 1st accused-appellant in his evidence said that deceased was the one who came to his"
"house  with  his  daughter.  He  had  denied  any  relationship  with  the  2nd  appellant.  He  had"
"testified that he was at home when the crime was taken place. The 2nd appellant had said that"
"1st appellant and his brother had come to her house in search of her husband at around 11.45"
"pm and at that time her husband had been already gone for fishing. After predicting that the"
"deceased had not gone out, she had searched deceased around the house. She had seen that"
"the pulley of the well had been broken. Then she had shouted and the 1st appellant and his"
"brother  had  come  near  the  well.  They  had  mentioned  in  their  evidence  that  the  police"
"statements have been recorded under duress."
"The  counsel  for  the  accused-appellant  had  mentioned  that  the  evidence  led  by  PW  2  had"
"failed to throw any light on the murky mystery surrounding the death of the deceased. He"
"had further stated that PW 2 was at the age of 13 when giving evidence at the trial and that"
"had created a lack of creditability in evidence."
