"In Mahasarukkalige Chandani v. Attorney General CA/213/2009 decided"
"on 30/06/2016 His Lordship Justice Malalgoda held that:"
"“As  observed  above,  that  Government  Analyst  Report  which  is  the"
"principal  evidence  in  a  drug  offence  entirely  depends  on  the  inward"
"journey of the production chain and therefore, there is a duty cast on the"
"prosecution  to  establish  the  inward  journey  of  the  production  with"
"reliable  evidence.  In  this  regard  it  is  important  to  note  that,  calling  a"
"witness who was at a police reserve to establish he was functioning as"
"reserve  officer  during  a  particular  time  is  not  sufficient  to  establish  a"
"production  chain  but,  he  has  to  give  evidence  confirming  that  the"
"productions referred to the said case was properly received by him and"
"properly handed over by him in good condition”."
