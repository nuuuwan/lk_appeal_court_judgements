"In this case  I am of the opinion that  it  is very appropriate to consider the"
"second and the fourth grounds of appeal first as the Appellant contends that"
"the learned trial judge has failed to consider that the prosecution has failed"

"not  correctly  applied  the  test  of  probability  and  improbability  in  order  to"

"As cited above, judicial precedents very forcefully endorse one unique point"
"that the inward journey of the production in drug related offences should not"
"be disturbed until it reaches for analysis. If any disturbance occurs during"
"the inward journey, an adverse outcome with regards to the prosecution case"
"is inevitable."
"Further I consider it is very appropriate to mention what Justice Mackenna"
"in  “Discretion”,  The  Irish  Jurist,  Vol.IX  (new  series),  1  at  page10  has"
"stated;"
