"In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz v. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:"
"“A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although"
"we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are"
"of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance"
"to fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions where the identity of the"
"good  analysis  for  examination  has  to  be  proved  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt.  A  prosecutor  should  take  pains  to  ensure  that  the  chain  of"
"events pertaining to the productions that had been taken charge from"
"the  Appellant  from  the  time  it  was  taken  into  custody  to  the  time  it"
"reaches the Government Analyst and comes back to the court should"
"be established”."
