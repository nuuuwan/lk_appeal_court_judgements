"the prosecution. Hence, it is not correct to say that the entire case relies on"
"uncorroborated evidence."
"But contradictory evidence has been led regarding the height and the entry"
"to  the  house  by  PW1  and  PW2.  According  to  PW1  the  height  of  the"
"surrounding  wall  is  between  3-4  feet  and  they  entered  the  premises  by"
"jumping over the wall. He denied the suggestion that the back wall is 10 feet"
"in height."
"But,  PW2  in  his  evidence  has  said  that  the  height  of  the  back  wall  of  the"
"house  is  about  10  feet  and  it  is  difficult  to  jump  over  the  wall  without  a"
"ladder.  As  witnesses  in  this  case  had  given  evidence  as  per  their  notes,"
"contradiction with regard to the height of the wall cannot occur in this case."
"I conclude that this contradiction would go to the root of the case and not"
"awarding  the  benefit  of  the  doubt  to  the  Appellants  in  such  a  case  is"
"unjustifiable."
