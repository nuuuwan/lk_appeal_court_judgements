"(Vide Page 44 of the Appeal Brief)"
"The appellant has failed to apply due diligence prior to purchasing the vehicle."
"While being aware of a pending case against the vehicle in question, the appellant"
"failed to assess whether the transferor had any right to transfer the vehicle to the"
"appellant.  The  vehicle  was  with  the  transferor  having  been  released  to  the"
"transferor  on  a  bond  pending  the  conclusion  of  the  vehicle  inquiry.  At  this"
"juncture, the maxim of “caveat emptor- qui ignorare non debuit quod jus alienum"
"emit” ought to be highlighted. “Let the Purchaser, who is not to be ignorant of the"
"amount  and  nature  of  the  interest,  exercise  proper  caution”.  In  short,  buyer"
"beware. Hence, the facts and circumstances of the instant appeal disentitle the"
"appellant  from  claiming  any  relief  or  redress  under  the  Forest  Ordinance  (as"
"amended)."
"Considering  the  above,  this  Court  finds  no  reason  to  interfere  with  either  the"
"confiscation  order  dated  20.04.2016  delivered  by  the  Learned  Magistrate  of"
"Balapitiya or the order delivered by the Learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya"
"dated14.09.2016."
"Appeal dismissed."
