"to the bottom and this injury had caused the severance of the main artery which leads to the"
"brain. The particular injury can cause immediate death to the person injured in such a manner."
"The witness placed his opinion before the Court stating that the injured person must have"
"been standing straight and the person who caused the injury must have been standing before"
"him while inflicting this injury. When this knife which was marked and annexed as ""P-2"" was"
"shown  to  the  Judicial  Medical  Officer  and  asked  if  this  particular  injury  could  have  been"
"caused by ""P-2"", he had said that it can surely cause it, in a manner as to corroborate with the"
"evidence already provided."
"Witness number 7 of the prosecution has stated in his evidence that when he took the knife,"
"there was sand on it and it was a knife used for toddy tapping. They were involved in toddy"
"tapping. The knife was in their possession, or that this incident happened while the second"
"accused  person  was  involved  in  tapping  toddy.  Therefore,  the  evidence  of  this  witness"
"corroborates with what was said earlier. When the defence had stated that the 01st accused"
"person had gone to the Police station with Theiventhiram Thanarasa, it was denied by this"
"witness."
"However,  there  was  no  evidence  produced  during  the  defence  case  to  prove  that  the"
"particular  accused  person  had  gone  to  the  police  station  with  Theiventhiram  Thanarasa."
"Therefore, the learned counsel for the respondent says that the Court should consider this"
"particular statement as a fabricated false statement. When the defence stated that this knife"
"was taken from Chanthiran Saroja's house, the 7th witness denied it and said that when this"
"first accused person showed the knife, it was taken from outside, at a distance away from"
"Chanthiran Saroja's house. When Chanthiran Saroja came as the 3rd witness for the defence"
"to Court and gave evidence, she has not mentioned anything about that."
"The  5th  witness  for  the  prosecution  has  given  evidence  before  Court  on  11.03.2014.  The"
"witness had stated in his evidence that Rasarathinam Uthayakumar was his cousin's son and"
"the particular incident happened by the side of the road and the main reason for this incident"
"was the fight which ensued between two communities during the previous night. Further, this"
"witness stated that during a dispute  and a fight on the previous day before this particular"
"murder incident happened, this accused person Mahenthiran and his wife and relations had"
"fought with each other. The witness had stated that on the second day while returning from"
"the Police, Mahenthiran, Murugananthan, Selvaranjan and the others had assaulted them."
"The accused had confirmed this fact while giving evidence from the dock. This witness had"
"stated that the two accused persons who are the first and the second accused persons ran"
"towards the east with knives the first accused person had a taping knife in his hand and while"
"Murugananthan the first accused person came with the knife and despite her attempt to stop"
"him he went ahead and involved himself in this incident."
"Further, the witness in her evidence stated that when Murugananthan came running from"
"the place where the incident had occurred, the knife which was in Murugananthan's hand"
"had blood stains and both the accused person ran from the east to the west. It is evident that"
"the  main  reason  for  this  incident  was  the  dispute  between  the  two  communities  which"
