"Q  :  Was it not in that place?"
"A:  It was not in that place. (Page 150)"
"Thus, it is very clear that this witness, Chief Inspector Thissa Senanayake was not the Police"
"officer, who recovered the P 4 - the knife. According to him, it was WPC Priyadarshini, who"
"did recover the said production. WPC Priyadarshini did not utter a word about her recovering"
"any production in her evidence. Her evidence was totally devoted to the fact of her having"
"recorded  the  statements  of  both  the  accused-appellants  and 
it  was  through  her,  the"
"prosecution led in evidence the relevant portions of the said statements under section 27 (1)"
"of the evidence ordinance and marked them as P 1 and P 2 respectively (pages 94 & 95)."
"To  a  specific  question  of  the 
learned  State  Counsel,  as  to  ""What  other  duties  did  you"
"undertake than recording the statements?"", WPC Priyadarshini (PW 13) answered that, ""No"
"other duties were undertaken by me"". This witness (PW 13) was very categorical on this point"
"of fact. It is equally pertinent that no productions, including a knife was shown to this witness"
"by the Learned State Counsel either before or after leading in evidence the above-mentioned"
"portions  of  the  statements  of  the  accused-appellants  and  marking  them  as  P  1  and  P  2"
"respectively."
"Learned Counsel for the appellant argued that the leading in evidence of the said portions of"
"the said statements under section 27 (1) of the Evidence ordinance was, in fact, a blatant and"
"gross abuse of the said section 27, for the said witness WPC Priyadarshini did not, at any time"
"and  at  any  stage  of her evidence  speak  about  any recovery  in  consequent  of,  any or  both"
"statements made by the accused-appellants respectively and recorded by her. It is a travesty"
"of 
justice 
that  the  said  evidence  was 
led 
in  this  manner  through  this  witness  WPC"
"Priyadarshini. Learned Counsel for the appellant says that both P 1 and P 2, and the evidence"
"connected and related to both, deserve to be rejected in terms of the law and in the interests"
"of Justice."
"Witness, Chief Inspector Thissa Senanayake had stated that P 5 the mamoty was ""recovered"
"based on the statement of Sumathy"", the 2nd accused-appellant. (Page 148)"
"Later, he has taken a different position."
