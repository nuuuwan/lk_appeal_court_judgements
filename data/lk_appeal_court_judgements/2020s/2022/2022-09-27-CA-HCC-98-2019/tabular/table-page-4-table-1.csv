"(v.)  The 
learned  Trial  Judge  has  failed  to  offer  appropriate  prominence  and  due"
"consideration to the defence witness by established legal principles."
"According to the witnesses at about 8:30 pm on 30.10.2000 two persons who covered their"
"faces had come to the bungalow where they resided and caused injuries to Sannasi Lechchami"
"(PW  2)  and  Sellaiya  Muttaiya  (PW  3)  and  attacked  the  deceased.  Then  they  have  taken"
"Arumugam  Mariamma  (PW  4)  and  Subramaniyam  Maheshwari  (PW  5)  to  the  tea  estate"
"nearby and raped them."
"At the trial, PW 5 has not given evidence as the prosecution could not find the whereabouts"
"of PW 5 and after an inquiry, her evidence which was given at the non-summary inquiry has"
"been adopted under section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"It was argued by the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel for the 2nd accused-appellant that the Trial"
"Judge  has  convicted 
the  appellant  of  all  the  charges  relying  on  uncorroborated  and"
"inconsistent evidence. The learned Trial Judge has stated in the judgment that the appellant"
"failed  to  challenge  the  testimony  of  PW  5  and  relied  on  her  evidence  in  convicting  the"
"appellant.  There  are  several  infirmities  in  her  evidence,  which  the  learned  Trial  Judge  has"
"ignored in evaluating her evidence. At the trial, PW 5 has not given evidence and her evidence"
"was adopted under section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance. When evaluating such  evidence,"
"the 
learned  Trial  Judge  should  be  cautious  as  such  evidence 
is  not  subject  to  cross-"
"examination at the High Court."
"It is my view that the learned Trial Judge has not given due consideration to the fact that such"
"evidence has infirmities including the fact that the learned High Court Judge was deprived of"
"observing  the  demeanour  and  deportment  of  the  said  witness.  Therefore,  such  evidence"
"should be corroborated by other evidence. However, PW 5 contradicts the testimony of PW"
"4, on several material points and medical evidence of PW 14 contradicts the version of PW 5."
"Before adopting the evidence of PW 5 under section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance, it was"
"incumbent on the learned High Court Judge that he should satisfy himself that the witness's"
"presence cannot be ensured. Leading evidence to the effect that she cannot be found to give"
"evidence is not sufficient when she is a crucial witness and the conviction is based on her"
"testimony."
"It is important to note that PW 4 who has testified regarding the rape has failed the test of"
"credibility while she was giving evidence in the High Court although she had given evidence"
"in the non-summary Inquiry. PW 5 was present in courts at the initial stages of the trial and"
"that  shows  PW  5  was  avoiding  the  trial,  may  be,  she  was  afraid  of  facing  the  cross-"
"examination."
"According to  the testimony of PW 4, the absconding witness  PW 5 was taken into the tea"
"estate by the 1st accused person (Vide page 136)."
"Page 136 of the appeal brief is as follows;"
