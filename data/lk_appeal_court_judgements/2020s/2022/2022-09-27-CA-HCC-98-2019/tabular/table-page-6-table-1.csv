"The learned Trial Judge has stated that the evidence of PW 4 is not challenged. However, in",""
"my view PW 4 is not a creditworthy witness on the following grounds;",""
"","At the trial, she stated that she was raped by both of the accused persons. It was"
"","reflected on pages 165 and 171 of the appeal brief.  However, according to her"
"","police statement, she was raped by only one person and the defence marked it"
"","as  an  omission.  Importantly,  even  the  learned  Trial  Judge  has  stated  in  the"
"","judgment that there is a doubt about the testimony of PW 4 regarding the rape."
"","According  to  the  medical  evidence  she  has  been  subjected  to  sexual  assault"
"","previously to the present incident as there were old tears in her hymen and PW"
"","4 had stated to the doctor that she was also previously sexually assaulted. This"
"","evidence was reflected on pages 182 and 188 of the appeal brief. At the trial, she"
"","categorically denied that she was subject to sexual assault before the incident."
"","At  the  trial,  PW  4  states  that  she  identified  both  the  accused  persons  at  the"
"","identification parade. However, only the 2nd accused-appellant was produced for"
"","the identification parade. The learned President’s Counsel argued that in the said"
"","circumstances,  it  is  unsafe  to  act  on  the  evidence  of  PW  4  as  her  evidence  is"
"","unreliable and inconsistent."
"","The learned Trial Judge has stated that the evidence of PW 2 is not challenged"
"","by the contradictions marked in her evidence. She fails to identify the appellant."
"","The learned Trial Judge has commented on her testimony and stated that she"
"","has not stated the name of the 2nd accused-appellant in the police statement"
"","and therefore it is an omission that goes to the root of this matter."
