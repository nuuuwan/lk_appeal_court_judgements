"behaviour."
"The appellant has pointed out that there is confusion as to who dragged who and went to"
"rape them. PW 4 and PW 5 have stated different persons. However, it should be noted that"
"the witnesses have stated that they were able to identify the accused from the moonlight. it"
"is practically possible they confused the two due to the insufficient light available and due to"
"the fear that they were facing as they were dragged."
"Therefore,  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  who  appeared  for  the  respondent  argued"
"that  this  confusion  should  not  be  considered  and 
it  does  not  affect  the  case  of  the"
"prosecution."
"The doctor who examined PW 4 and PW 5 stated that PW 5 had no injuries on her body even"
"though she has stated that she was struggling naked on the ground and the appellant bit her"
"body. PW 14 examined PW 5 on 2nd November, whereas the incident took place on the 30th"
"of October. It is after three days that PW 5 was examined, and that is sufficient time for the"
"wounds to heal and disappear from the body. It is highly probable for the bite not to leave a"
"wound on the face and even if there was a wound it can disappear also as a minor scratch"
"wound and heal within three days."
"The learned counsel for the respondent submits that it should be noted that the presence of"
"injuries is not required to prove the offence of rape. PW 5 states that the incident occurred"
"on 29.09.2000. She specifically states it as the ninth month. PW 2 states the incident occurred"
"on a different date. PW 4 states the incident occurred on the 31st of October. It should be"
"noted  that  different  witnessesâ€™  state  different  dates,  and 
it  should  not  be  given  much"
"attention. The witnesses are giving evidence after ten years of the incident and it is natural"
"for them to forget the exact date."
"The Trial Judge has pointed out the contradiction in PW 4 stating that both the  appellants"
"have raped her, and concluded that the first accused was not involved in the crime and it is"
"the second accused-appellant who has committed the crime."
"The identity of the appellant has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt and the appellant"
"was indicted on the mistaken identity."
"Learned Counsel for the respondent argued that there is no doubt about the identity of the"
"appellant. PW 2 has stated that she  knows the second accused-appellant as a person who"
"works in a lorry and she has also stated that the first accused  person worked at the police"
"station. It has also been stated that they were able to identify the accused inside the house"
"with the aid of the torch the accused had with them. Even if the identification of the accused"
"by PW 4 and PW 5 can be challenged as they say they identified them with the moonlight, the"
"identification with the use of the torchlight could be challenged."
"The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the law and legal principle relating to common"
"intention. The learned High Court Judge has based his judgment on the fact that the appellant"
"committed the crimes while the first accused person did not commit any crime. It has been"
"pointed out by evidence that the first accused was merely standing and observing along with"
