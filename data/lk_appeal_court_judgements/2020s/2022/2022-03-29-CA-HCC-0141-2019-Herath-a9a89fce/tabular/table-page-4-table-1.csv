"","witnesses.  Further, 
it  was 
submitted 
that 
as  per 
the  proceeding  dated"
"","12.12.2018,  the  learned  State  Counsel  who  prosecuted  in  the  High  Court  has"
"","clearly stated that the prosecution was not able to corroborate the evidence of"
"","PW2.  Therefore,  the  State  Counsel  has  added  to  the  list  of  witnesses,  some"
"","other  police  officers  who  participated  in  the  raid  and  made  notes  on  the  raid."
"","However,  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  call  any  of  the  police  officers  who"
"","participated 
in 
the  raid  as  witnesses 
to  corroborate 
the  evidence  of  PW2,"
"","although 
they  were 
listed 
in 
the 
indictment  as  witnesses.  The 
learned"
"","President’s  Counsel  submitted  that  under  these  circumstances,  it  is  unsafe  to"
"","convict the appellant on the evidence of the sole witness PW2."
"5.","The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  appellant  further  submitted  that  the"
"","learned  trial  Judge  has  rejected  the  evidence  of  the  defence  witnesses  for  no"
"","good reason and that both the appellant’s wife DW1, and the neighbour DW2,"
"","are proved to be truthful witnesses."
"6.","It  is  the  contention  of  the  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  that  the  failure  to"
"","corroborate  the  evidence  of  the  PW2  should  not  be  a  reason  to  vitiate  the"
"","conviction. The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that if the Court finds"
"","the  PW2’s  evidence  to  be  credible,  on  the  evidence  of  a  single  witness  the"
"","Court  may  find  the  accused  guilty.  The  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  further"
"","submitted 
that 
the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has 
rightly  considered 
the"
"","inconsistencies  in  the  evidence  of  the  defence  witnesses  and  rejected  their"
"","evidence."
"7.","In  terms  of  Section  134  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  no  particular  number  of"
"","witnesses  shall  in  any  case  be  required  for  proof  of  any  fact.  In  case  of"
