"","II. 
Did the learned High Court Judge err in concluding that PW2 Bandara"
"","was a credible witness and that the accused appellant could be convicted"
"","based on his uncorroborated testimony?"
"2.","Brief facts of the case as per the evidence adduced by the prosecution are that"
"","PW2  PC30204  Bandara  has  been  on 
surveillance  duty  with 
Inspector"
"","Tennakoon (PW1) when at 0805 hours he received information on  trafficking"
"","of heroin. The informant had asked the PW2 to come near the Nawaloka Hotel,"
"","Peliyagoda.  He 
has 
immediately 
informed 
the 
team 
leader 
Inspector"
"","Tennakoon, and Inspector Tennakoon has organized the police officers for the"
"","raid."
"3.","According  to  PW2,  when  he  received  the  information,  they  have  been  at  the"
"","petrol  shed  near  the  Samantha  film  hall  Maligawatte.  They  have  left  at  0810"
"","hours  for  Peliyagoda,  where  he  met  the  informant.  He  has  introduced  the"
"","informant  to  the  Inspector  Tennakoon  (PW1)  and  they  have  had  a  discussion"
"","inside  the  Nawaloka  Hotel,  where  they  were  informed  that  the  person  who"
"","brings heroin, by the name of Upali, can be shown at  Kandana Church Road"
"","Junction  at  about  1000  hours.  Thereafter,  the  team  had  left  for  Kandana  at"
"","about  0850  hours.  They  have  reached  Kandana  at  0945  hours.  They  have"
"","parked their vehicle in front of the Kandana Police Station. PW1, PW2 and the"
"","informant have gone towards the Church Road Junction and had stopped near"
"","the  Singer Showroom. At  about  1020 hours,  the  informant  has shown  them  a"
"","person  walking  along  the  Church  Road  as  Upali  and  the  informant  has  left."
"","PW2 has gone with PW1, and PW1 has stopped and questioned the said Upali."
"","When IP Tennakoon (PW1) searched the suspect (appellant), he has found the"
"","parcel that contained heroin in the front-right side pocket of the pair of shorts"
"","that he was wearing."
"4.","It  was  evident  that  the  PW1  has  left  the  police  service  and  therefore  the"
"","prosecution  has  not  been  able  to  call  PW1  as  a  witness.  The  prosecution  has"
"","called only  PW2 as a  witness from among the Police  officers  who conducted"
"","the raid. After the prosecution case was closed, the appellant has made a dock"
"","statement,  and  two  witnesses  have  given  sworn  evidence  on  behalf  of  the"
"","defence.  The  two  defence  witnesses  were  the  wife  of  the  appellant  and  a"
"","neighbour.  It  was  the  contention  of  the  learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  for  the"
"","appellant,  as  PW1  was  not  called  to  give  evidence  by  the  prosecution,  the"
"","defence  was  prevented  from  cross-examining  the  witness  so  that  they  could"
"","have  established  the  inconsistencies  between  the  evidence  of  the  prosecution"
