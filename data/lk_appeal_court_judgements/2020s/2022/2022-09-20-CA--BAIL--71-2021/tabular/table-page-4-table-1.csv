"As such in the instant matter we observe that the suspect has been in remand"
"for more than one year without any charges being filed against the suspect."
"According to the provisions of the above mentioned act it is very clearly stated"
"that action filed under this act should be given precedence over other matters."
"But in the instant matter we observe that it has been grossly violated and we"
"also note that although this act is enacted to safe guard the rights of victims and"
"witnesses it should not be used as a tool against any person to avenge personal"
"grievances."
"Therefore  the  period  in  remand  without  due  administration  of  justice  being"
"meted out to the suspect we conclude to be exceptional enough to enlarge the"
"suspect on following conditions of bail,"
