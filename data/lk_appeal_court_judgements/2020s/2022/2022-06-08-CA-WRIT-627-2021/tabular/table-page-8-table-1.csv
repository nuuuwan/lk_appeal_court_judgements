"2207/07  dated  23.12.2020)  indicates  that  an  appeal  against  a  decision  or  action  of  a"
"National Association of Sports must be made in writing to the Minster within 7 days of"
"the  receipt  of  such  decision.  The  learned  ASG  asserts  that  as  per  paragraph  34  of  the"
"Petition, it is evinced that the Petitioner was possessed with the decision of the National"
"Association of Sports on the rejection of the Petitioner’s nominations for the Election by"
"21.04.2021. However, she has appealed to such decision only on 11.05.2021 (see-‘P36’),"
"that is almost two weeks after the said decision. Hence, the learned ASG submits that the"
"said Appeal, ‘P36’ was clearly made out of time in violation of the mandatory time period"
"prescribed by the regulations."
"In the above backdrop, I see no reason to grant any relief to the Petitioner in reference to"
"‘P17’, ‘P19’, ‘P33’, ‘P34(b)’, ‘P39’ & ‘P40’ as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition. In"
"addition to the mandates in the nature of writs of Certiorari sought by the Petitioner in the"
"instant application, a writ of Quo Warranto is also being sought. I take the view that the"
"nature of formulating the said relief as per in paragraph (d) of the prayer of the Petition is"
"misconceived in law. Further, I take the view that the relief for a mandate in the nature of"
"Mandamus as prayed for in the paragraph (e) of the prayer of the Petition is beyond the"
"scope of the contents in the body of the Petition."
"Thus,  based  on  the  arguability  principles  that  should  be  adopted  in  respect  of  matters"
"relating to issuance of notice in a judicial review application, I arrive at the conclusion,"
"that there is no arguable case or a prima facie case for this Court to issue formal notice on"
"the Respondents of this application. Therefore, I proceed to refuse this application."
