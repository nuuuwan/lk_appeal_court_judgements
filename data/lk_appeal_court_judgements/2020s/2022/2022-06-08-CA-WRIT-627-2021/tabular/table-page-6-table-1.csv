"As I have discussed in my judgement K.G.D Walter Abeysundera and another vs. Mr."
"S. Hettiarachchi, Secretary, Ministry of Tourism and other, CA/Writ/371/2021"
"(
decided on 22.09.2021), I am of the view that in instances where the impugned action"
"takes place in stages, the challenge should be launched against the earliest stage rather than"
"the final and decisive stage1."
"In the circumstances, when analyzing the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioners, it is my view"
"that the Petitioner's conduct, particularly the acquiescence in the inquiry procedure should"
"be taken into consideration. The Petitioner, without recoursing to this Court by way of a"
"judicial review application against the said charge sheet at the initial stage, has participated"
"in the other stages of the inquiry and accordingly, has waited until she got an unfavourable"
"decision following the inquiry. In juridical review, the Court is concerned with the legality"
"of a decision and also whether it is lawful or unlawful. Accordingly, the said conduct of"
"the  Petitioner,  in  my  view,  has  intensified  the  delay  to  apply  to  this  Court  at  the  first"
"instance.  Further  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  furnish  any  justifiable  explanation  for  her"
"delay 
in  challenging 
the  documents  marked 
‘P17’  dated  20.10.2019, 
‘P19’  dated"
"08.01.2020 and ‘P34(b)’ dated 07.11.2019. Therefore, in my view, the Petitioner is guilty"
"of laches and has failed to explain the delay in challenging the preliminary stages of the"
"inquiry including the charge sheet marked ‘P17’."
"Now,  I  advert  to  examine  whether  the  Petitioner  has  submitted  a  prima  facie  case"
"irrespective of the fact that she is guilty of laches as I have explained above."
"By virtue of the letter dated 21.08.2019 marked ‘P11’, the Petitioner has been suspended"
"from her membership of the SLHF from 21.08.2019. The Petitioner pleads that at the time"
"the nominations for the Election were called on or about 15.03.2021, the Petitioner was"
"under the impression that the ban on her membership had been set aside and that there"
"would be no further action taken against her by any authority."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the 1st, 3rd, 6th and 7th Respondents and the learned"
"Additional  Solicitor  General  (‘ASG’)  for  the  10th  to  17th  Respondents  assert  that  the"
