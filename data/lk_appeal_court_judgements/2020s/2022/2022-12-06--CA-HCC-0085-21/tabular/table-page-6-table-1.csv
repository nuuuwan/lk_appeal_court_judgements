"The learned counsel for the respondents contended that this leave to"
"appeal application could not be maintained because all grounds stated"
"in the paragraph 5 of the appellant’s petition are questions of law and"
"in  terms  of  Section  15(a)(i)  of  the  Judicature  Act,  leave  should  be"
"obtained  from  the  Court  of  Appeal  only  if  the  appeal  is  based  on  a"
"question of fact alone or on a question of mixed law and fact. It is correct"
"that  if  it  is  only  a  question  of  law,  direct  appeal  has  to  be  preferred."
"However, when considering the case at hand, the learned High Court"
"Judge  has  acquitted  the  first  and  second  accused  after 
full  trial."
"Without  evaluating  the  evidence  of  the  case,  if  the  learned  Judge"
"considered only the legal issue of filing the case without the approval of"
"all  three  commissioners  and  decided  that  the  case  could  not  be"
"proceeded, the accused should have been discharged. As the impugned"
"judgment is a judgment of acquittal, the ground (VI) stated in paragraph"
"5 of the petition that “the learned trial Judge has failed to evaluate the"
"evidence led and the documents marked by the prosecution” is a ground"
"to be considered in the appeal. Hence, the grounds pertaining to this"
"appeal are questions of mixed law and facts. Therefore, the applicable"
"section is not Section 15(a)(i), but Section 15(a)(ii) of the Judicature Act."
"When it is a question of mixed law and fact, the appellant has to obtain"
"leave first from the Court of Appeal in terms of section 15(a)(ii) of the"
"Judicature Act, as correctly pleaded in this leave to appeal application."

The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations"
