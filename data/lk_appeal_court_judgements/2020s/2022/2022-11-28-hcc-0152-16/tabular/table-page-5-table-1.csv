"E.R.S.R  Coomaraswami  in his treatise “Law of Evidence” Vol 2 book 2 at"
"page 658 has stated as follows referring to child witnesses:"
"“There is no requirement in English Law, that the sworn evidence of a"
"child witness needs to be corroborated as matter of law. But the jury"
"should  be  warned,  not  to  look  for  corroboration,  but  of  the  risk"
"involved in acting on the sole evidence of young girls or boys, though"
"they may do so if convinced of the truth of such evidence…….. This"
"requirement is based on the susceptibility of children to the influence"
"of others and to the surrender to their imagination”."
