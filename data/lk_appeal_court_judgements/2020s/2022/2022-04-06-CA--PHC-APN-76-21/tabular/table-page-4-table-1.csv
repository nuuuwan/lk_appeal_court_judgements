"the person because of continued incarceration. i.e., the present danger to"
"the person’s life.  Concerning the purported delay in the conclusion of the"
"appeal, petitioner has failed to prove any excessive or oppressive delay.  In"
"the  impugned  order,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  refers  to  a  Journal"
"Entry, which describes an instance where an attempt was made to subvert"
"the  due  administration  of 
justice,  which  was  an  additional  element"
"considered by the High Court in refusing to release the petitioner on bail."
"Now that the impugned order has been examined, the submissions made"
"by the counsel for the petitioner will be evaluated."
"The  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted  that  he  would  be  raising  a"
"question of law that was not raised during the trial but will be taken up in"
"appeal.  The  counsel  sought  to  raise  the  same  objection  in  the  instant"
"matter, 
stating 
that 
the 
issue  of 
law  amounts 
to  an 
exceptional"
"circumstance. He submitted that the nature of this question of law and its"
"implications affect the very root of the prosecution instituted against the"
"petitioner, thus amounting to an exceptional circumstance warranting the"
"release  of  the  petitioner  on  bail  pending  appeal.  In  the  submission,  the"
"counsel 
for 
the  petitioner  referred 
to 
the 
‘precedent’  set  by Anoma"
"Polwatte v Jayawickrama Director General, Bribery Commission and"
"Others SC 
(writ)  01/2011  SC  Minute  dated  26.07.2018, Nandasena"
"Gotabhaya  Rajapakse  v  CIABOC CA  (Revision)  APN  No  29/2018  CA"
"Minute dated 12.09.2019 and another similar case. It was submitted that"
"the  legal  issue  thus  raised  points  to  patent  illegality  because  there  is  a"
"great likelihood that the petitioner would be acquitted in appeal and that"
"the continued incarceration of the petitioner is unjustifiable. The petitioner"
"contended  that  the  respondent  has  failed  to  provide  evidence  of 
‘the"
"certificate  of  03  Commissioners  of  the  Bribery  Commission  signing  and"
"authorizing the filing of this action which is now deemed to be an imperative"
"prerequisite in respect of action instituted by the Bribery Commission’ (Vide"
"Paragraph 16 of the Petition)."
