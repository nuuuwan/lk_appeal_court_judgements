"by him. When weighed at the PNB, the brown-coloured powder had 234 grams"
"and when subjected to a field test it has confirmed that in fact the substance"
"was  Heroin.  Later  PW-01  has  taken  due  steps  to  seal  the  productions  and  to"
"produce the productions and the appellant to the relevant officers of the PNB."
"PW-01  has  identified  and  marked  the  relevant  productions at  the  trial.  It  was"
