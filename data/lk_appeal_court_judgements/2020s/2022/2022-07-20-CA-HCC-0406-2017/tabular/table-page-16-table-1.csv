"This  is  a  detection  that  is  said  to  have  been  made  on  the  3rd  of  August  2004"
"nearly eighteen years ago. The appellant has been in remand custody for over"
"five  years  before  he  was  released  on  bail  in  the  year  2009.  He  has  been  in"
"prison custody pending his appeal from the date of his conviction on the 13th of"
"December  2017,  for  four  and  half  years.  If  he  is  subjected  to  a  second  trial,"
"some eighteen years after the actual event, that will be for no fault on his part."
"Moreover,  traumatic  effect  on  a  second  trial  for  the  appellant  and  his  family"
"members  so 
long  after  the  event  will  also  need  the  attention 
in  such  a"
"consideration."
"It  is  my  considered  view  that  this  is  not  a  fit  and  proper  case  where  a  retrial"
"should  be  ordered 
for  the  reasons  considered  as  above.  The  appellant 
is"
"therefore acquitted of the charge preferred against him."
"Appeal allowed."
