"He also brought to the attention of the Court, the provisions of Section 4(d) of"
"the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act. It was"
"his  submission  that  the  rejection  of  the  defence  evidence  on  a  wrong  premise"
"has caused immense prejudice to the appellant which amounts to a denial of a"
"fair trial."
"It was the position  of the learned Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG) on behalf of"
"the  Attorney  General  that  the  evidence  of  the  prosecution  witnesses  was"
"consistent where there have been no contradictions or omissions in relation to"
"the material points relevant to the charge. It was his contention that although"
"the appellant had given evidence and called a witness in support of his stand,"
"what  needs  to  be  looked  at  is  whether  the  position  taken  up  by  the  appellant"
"has  created  a  reasonable  doubt  as  to  the  evidence  of  the  prosecution  or"
"whether it has provided a reasonable explanation as to the charge against the"
"appellant. It was his position that the evidence of the appellant and the witness"
"called on behalf of him are not consistent with each other and has not created"
"any doubt as to the evidence of the prosecution."
"Under  the  circumstances,  it  was  his  view  that  the  appellant  has  failed  to"
"establish  sufficient  grounds  to  succeed  in  his  appeal  and  the  appeal  should"
"stand dismissed."
