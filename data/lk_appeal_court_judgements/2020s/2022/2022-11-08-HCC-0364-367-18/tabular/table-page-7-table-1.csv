"Especially in the case of a murder, it is the bounded duty of the prosecutor"
"to put the question to the doctor. Whatever may be the opinion of the judge"
"or the prosecutor, it is always the duty of the Court as well as the prosecutor"
"in a murder case to have medical evidence on the point of the nature of the"
"injuries. Where this is not done the sessions Judge, when the case comes"
"up before him, ought to examine the doctor.”"
"Stated further;"
"“Absence of medical evidence, the Court must regard the injury as a lesser"
"injury,  and  hold  that  it  is  not  a  case  of  culpable  homicide  amounting  to"
"murder.  It  all  depends  on  the  evidence  about  the  injuries.  If  the  injury  is"
"such that the Court might itself think it to be sufficient in the ordinary course"
"of nature to cause death even without medical testimony, it may not be open"
"in some cases to say that it is a case of murder and therefore, it is desirable"
"that there must also be medical testimony.”"
