"Chairman of an Urban Council, the petitioner must name the individual person against whom"
"the writ can be issued.”"
"The Petitioner has sought the relief of a writ of mandamus against the 3rd and 4th Respondents. In"
"our view, the Petitioner should be vigilant to take steps to make the necessary amendments and"
"substitute the correct party against whom he can have an effective judgment. Specifically, when"
"seeking the relief of a writ of mandamus. However even after it was brought to the notice of the"
"court and to all parties, there was no application to amend the caption and for substitution. Thus,"
"the Respondents’ submission that the said relief even if granted would be futile, also succeeds."
"Accordingly, for the aforesaid reasons set out above in this judgment, this Court refuses to grant"
"the reliefs prayed in the petition and we dismiss this application without cost."
