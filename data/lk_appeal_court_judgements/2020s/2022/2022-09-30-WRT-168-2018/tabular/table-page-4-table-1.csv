"by him and has only considered the material of the complainant Respondent and thereby has"
"violated the rule of Audi Altrem Partem."
"At the argument stage, the Petitioner complained that the 3rd Respondent’s order violates section"
"7(10) of the Act."
"The Petitioner has prayed for the following relief."
"(b)  issue   a   mandate   in   the   nature   of   a   writ   of   certiorari   to   quash   the   decision   of   the   3 rd"
"Respondent on 08/03/2018"
"(c) issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus against the 3rd and 4th Respondents to"
"accept the 2nd Respondent/ Petitioner as the Tenant Cultivator."
"All  parties  made  extensive  submissions  to this  Court and have  filed  their  respective  written"
"submissions."
"The Complainant-Respondent, as well as the 3rd and 4th  Respondents, took several objections"
"pertaining to the Petitioner’s application and at the argument stage, all the Respondents argued"
"interalia  that there is misrepresentation and willful suppression of material facts and therefore"
"the Petitioner’s application has to fail."
"Both the Claimant-Respondent and the Petitioner are not at variance on the fact that the original"
"owners of half a share of the paddy field were Somapala Mendis and Sugathadas Mendis. The"
"said Somapala Mendis is the father of the Complainant-Respondent. In the year 1996, Somapala"
"Mendis   had   given   his   undivided   ½   share   to   the   daughter,   the   Complainant-Respondent."
"Thereafter   the   said   Sugathadasa   Mendis   too   had   transferred   his   undivided   ½   share   to   the"
"Complainant-Respondent   in   the   year   2005.   Thus,   the   Claimant-Respondent   had   become   the"
"owner of the paddy field in question. Her name has been registered in the paddy land register.1"
"However, it is the contention of the Petitioner that despite the ownership being transferred, the"
"said Somapala and Sugathadasa had remained the landlords of the paddy field. At the argument"
"stage, the Learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the Petitioner, submitted that they are not"
"contesting the ownership of the Claimant-Respondents. It is pertinent to note that the Petitioner"
"himself   has   averred   in   his   petition   that   the   said   Somapala   had   gifted   his   ½   share   to   the"
"Complainant-Respondent in 1996 by way of a deed of gift, leaving the life interest to them."
"However, the said life interest too had been transferred to the daughter on 21.12.2004. It is not"
"disputed that the co-owner Sugathadasa Mendis too had gifted his undivided ½ share to the"
"Complainant-Respondent   on   15.09.2005   making   the   Complainant-Respondent   the   absolute"
"owner of the paddy field. It is also common ground that the 1 st  Respondent-Respondent is the"
"registered tenant cultivator. The parties are not in dispute that the applicable law is the Agrarian"
"Development   Act   No   46   of   2000.   The   parties   are   also   not   in   dispute   that   the   Petitioner   is"
"cultivating the land but is not registered as the tenant cultivator in the agrarian lands register."
"While the Petitioner claims that he is cultivating in the capacity of the tenant cultivator, the"
"Claimant-Respondent   contends   that   he   is   a   sublessee   of   the   1st  Respondent   and   the   1st"
"1 Paddy land register marked P1"
