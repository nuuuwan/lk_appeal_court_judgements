"Hence,  the  learned  High  Court  judge  has  focused  on  the  primary  burden  cast"
"upon  the  appellant  under  the  Act,  a 
fact  upon  which  the  entire  revision"
"application  pivots,  and  has  assessed  the  measures  taken  by  the  appellant  in"
"dispensing such a burden as prima facie inadequate. This determination of the"
"learned High Court judge has led to the conclusion that it is futile to proceed to"
"an  examination  of  the  merits  of  the  case  and  has  dismissed  the  appellant’s"
"application in limine. The appellant has failed to satisfy the learned High Court"
"judge that there exist any prima facie irregularity, illegality or impropriety in the"
"Magistrate Court order dated 19.05.2017 which needs further examination."
"Hence, it is clear that the High Court judge has not been alerted to any ‘glittering"
"circumstances’ which shock the conscience of the Court. Therefore, the learned"
"High  Court  judge  has  used  his  discretion  and  has  dismissed  the  appellant’s"
"application in limine. We do not see the said determination by the learned High"
"Court judge as acting outside his role during the support stage. It is well within"
"the scope of his discretion to dismiss the application in limine, when there is no"
"prima facie case to intervene with the Magistrate’s order."
"At  this  juncture,  it  is  pertinent  to  refer  to  the  Magistrate  Court  order  dated"
"19.05.2017 that was sought to be canvassed before the High Court. The appellant"
"has given contradictory position where evidence revealed that she was aware of"
"the loading of timber on to her vehicle without a valid permit, but claimed she"
"was unaware that such act was illegal. (Vide page 48 and 62 of the Brief). While"
"reinforcing  the  maxim  Ignorantia  juris  non  excusat  (ignorance  of  the  law  is  no"
"excuse), it is the view  of this Court  that the proceedings in  the vehicle inquiry"
"also points to the lack of a prima facie case in seeking to revise the order of the"
"Magistrate dated 19.05.2017."
"In consideration of all the above facts within the context of wide judicial discretion"
"vested with the Court in exercising its revisionary jurisdiction (see Weerasinghe"
"Arachchilage  Deepa  Nandani  v  Officer 
in  Charge,  Police  Station  Marawila"
"CA/PHC/APN/134/20 CA Minute dated 20.07.2021), it is the view of this Court"
"that the impugned order has dismissed the appellant’s revision application for"
