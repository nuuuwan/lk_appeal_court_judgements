"examination of it required a consideration of the merits. The said observation is"
"as follows:"
"“for  example,  admittedly  the  petition  at  paragraph  13  identifies  what  are"
"said  to  be  exceptional  circumstances  but  whether  they  in  fact  amount  to"
"exceptional circumstances requires a consideration of the merits of the case."
"In my view,  it  is inappropriate for a court  to consider whether exceptional"
"circumstances exist in a revision application at the stage of notice for if that"
"is  the correct  approach the issue of exceptional circumstances ends there."
"There  is  no  further  matter  to  be  considered  at  the  stage  of  argument  on"
"exceptional  circumstances.  At  the  stage  of  support,  Court  need  only  to"
"consider whether the petitioner has made out a prima facie case for notice”."
"The counsel for the appellant also referred to Ingiriya Multi-Purpose Co-operative"
"Society  Ltd  v  Kalubalage  Dona  Laitha  Srimathi  CA/PHC/123/16  CA  Minute"
"dated 17.05.2022, which echoed a similar sentiment."
"“When the matter is at the support stage, the court is not required to assess"
"whether  the  purported  exceptional  circumstances  do  in  fact  amount  to  an"
"exceptionality  of  a  nature  that  warrants  the  invocation  of  the  revisionary"
"jurisdiction. That matter must be decided on the merits of the case. In  the"
"instant  matter,  the  petitioner  has  not  patently  omitted  to  aver  exceptional"
"circumstances.  Paragraph  28  sets  out 
the  exceptional 
circumstances"
"averred by the petitioner in the petition. Nevertheless, the impugned order"
"states that there are exceptional circumstances are not apparent. However,"
"the learned Magistrate does not refer to the averments of Paragraph 28 of"
"the petition, nor a determination has been made or reasons given whether"
"they are in fact exceptional circumstances warranting the invocation of the"
"revisionary  jurisdiction  or  mere  substantial  questions  of  law  outside  the"
"revisionary  ambit 
(see  Elangakoon  v  Officer 
in  Charge,  Police  Station,"
"Eppawala 
(2007)  1  SLR  398).  The 
impugned  order  merely  says 
that"
