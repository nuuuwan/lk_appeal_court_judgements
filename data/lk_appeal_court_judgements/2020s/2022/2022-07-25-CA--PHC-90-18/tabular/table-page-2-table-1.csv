"This is an  appeal  filed  against  an order of  the  High Court of  Kegalle dated 14."
"06.2018, which dismissed the revision application of the appellant in limine. The"
"said revision application was filed against an order under the Forest Ordinance"
"as amended by Act No. 65 of 2009 (hereinafter the Act) delivered by the Magistrate"
"Court of  Kegalle  on  19.05.2017,  which  ordered  the  appellant’s  vehicle  (SG  40-"
"5792) to be confiscated. The appellant is the registered owner of the said vehicle,"
"and she has preferred the instant appeal to this Court to assess whether the High"

"examination  could  be  made  and  held  that  those  objections  which  do  not  fall"
"within  that  criterion  will  not  be  dealt  with  at  the  current  stage.  After  the  said"
"assessment,  the  Court  concluded  that  out  of  the  four  objections  raised  by  the"
"respondent, only two amounts to preliminary objections and refused to entertain"

"The counsel for the appellant in the instant matter relies on an observation made"
