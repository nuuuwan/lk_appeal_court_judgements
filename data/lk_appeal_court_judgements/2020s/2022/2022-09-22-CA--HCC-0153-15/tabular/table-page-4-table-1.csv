"On the day the 1st accused-appellant was produced before the Trial Judge, the indictment was"
"not read over and plea was not recorded. The learned President’s Counsel who appeared for"
"the  1st  accused-appellant  argued  that  the  1st  accused  was  not  given  the  Jury  option.  The"
"evidence which had been already led had not been read over and explained to the 1st accused"
"person."
"On  28.02.2013  application  was  made  on  behalf  of  the  1st  accused-appellant  under  Section"
"241(3)  to  call  the  witnesses  who  had  already  given  evidence.  The  learned  State  Counsel"
"objected to that application but he made another application to call PW 01 to identify the 1st"
"accused person. There were no orders made by the learned Trial Judge, regarding the above"
"two applications."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the 1st accused-appellant submitted that on that day the"
"evidence  of  another  Police  witness  namely  Stanley  Peiris  was  led.  The  evidence  which  had"
"been  already 
led  had  not  been  read  over  and  explained  to  the  1st  accused  person.  On"
"30.06.2013 main eyewitness, PW 01 was called to give evidence for the second time. On an"
"application  made  by  the  State,  the  witnesses  PW03,  PW06  and  PW  12  were  called  to  give"
"evidence for the 2nd time. It is clear that the learned Trial Judge had allowed only to call the"
"witnesses needed by the prosecution. Only in respect of the above witnesses, the 1st accused"
"person  had  got  an  opportunity  to  cross-examine.  Therefore,  the  learned  High  Court  had"
"impliedly refused the application of the 1st accused appellant and allowed the application of"
"the learned State Counsel."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  not  given  reasons  to  reject  the  application  of  the  1st"
"accused which was made under Section 241(3).  In this case, the judgment was written  by a"
"learned High Court Judge who did not hear the evidence of the main witnesses. He had stated"
"that the application of the 1st accused person was allowed and the witnesses were called on"
"the application of the Defence Counsel. After the conclusion of the defence case, it was fixed"
"for submissions and at that time the indictment was amended and plea was recorded before"
"the Trial Judge."
"The  learned  President’s Counsel for  the 1st  accused-appellant  says that the  Jury  option  was"
"also  questioned  at  that  stage.  Therefore,  the  proceedings  before  that  stage  should  be"
"considered as null and void. After the defence case was concluded surprisingly, the Learned"
"High  Court  Judge  allowed  the  prosecution  to  lead  the  evidence  of  a  prosecution  witness  in"
"order  to  cover  up  few 
loop  holes.  The 
learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  1st  accused-"
"appellant argued that, way to call witnesses by the prosecution after the defence case is over,"
"by way of evidence in rebuttal. That procedure was not followed by the learned Trial Judge."
"Before commencement of the trial, the evidence of the warrant execution officer was led. He"
"had 
recorded  statements 
from  Gunaseeli 
Indrani  Samaradivakara,  Nissanka  Arachchige"
"Devika  Karunaratne  and  Dissanayake  Appuhamilage  Lillian  Karunaratne,  Warnakulasuriya"
"Mattegoda  Kankanamlage  Sarpinu  Fernando.  The 
learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  1st"
"accused-appellant submitted that the above witnesses were not called but their statements"
"had been marked as ""X"" and produced by the prosecution during the 241 inquiry.  The order"
"to  proceed  with  the  trial  under  section  241  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code  was  based  on"
"inadmissible evidence."
