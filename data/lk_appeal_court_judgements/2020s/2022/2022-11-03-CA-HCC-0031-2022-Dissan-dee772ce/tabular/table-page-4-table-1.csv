"4.","It  was  the  contention  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"","appellant  that,  the  12  years  sentence  imposed  by  the"
"","learned  High  Court  Judge 
is  excessive.  He 
further"
"","submitted 
that, 
the  appellant  was  a 
first  offender"
"","without any previous convictions. The learned Counsel"
"","requested  the  Court  to  reduce  the  sentence,  stating"
"","further 
that, 
there  was  no  permanent  damage  or"
"","permanent  danger  caused  to  the  victim.  The  learned"
"","Counsel further submitted that, the learned trial Judge"
"","could  have  taken  into  consideration  the  fact  that  the"
"","prisons are overcrowded."
"5.","The 
learned 
State 
Counsel 
for 
the 
respondent"
"","submitted  that,  when  considering  the  facts  and  the"
"","circumstances  of 
this  case, 
the  custodial  sentence"
"","imposed  on  the  appellant  by  the  learned  High  Court"
"","Judge  is  justified.  The  learned  State  Counsel  further"
"","submitted that, the appellant has attempted to kill the"
"","victim  when 
the 
victimâ€™s 
daughter 
had 
filed 
a"
"","maintenance  action  against  the  appellant.  That  action"
"","was pending in the Magistrate Court. The post conduct"
"","of 
the 
appellant 
shows 
that  he  was  not 
at 
all"
"","remorseful.  When  the  police  officers  arrived  after  four"
"","hours, the appellant has still been roaming around the"
"","house  with  the  knife.  The  knife  used  by  the  appellant"
"","has been a Rambo knife, and this shows that  it was a"
"","preplanned  assault.  It  is  the  contention  of the  learned"
"","State Counsel that, the appellant being a trained army"
"","soldier,  has  used  the  skills  that  he  obtained  from  the"
"","army training to commit the offence and therefore that"
"","should be considered an aggravating factor."
"6.","The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has  delivered  her"
"","sentencing 
judgment  on  22nd  January  2021.  The"
"","prescribed 
sentence 
for 
the 
offence 
of 
attempted"
"","murder,  in  terms  of  section  300  of  the  Penal  Code  is"
"","imprisonment  of  either  description  for  a  term  which"
"","may  extend  to  20  years  and  a  fine.  The  learned  High"
"","Court  Judge  in  her  sentencing  judgment  delivered  on"
