"was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years of Rigorous Imprisonment for"
"all four charges, ordered to run concurrently, to be carried out in 10 years"
"commencing from the date of sentencing: 22.01.2020 Aggrieved by the said"
"conviction,  the  petitioner  filed  an  application  for  appeal.  Thereafter  two"
"applications  for  bail  pending  appeal  were  preferred.  Both  were  refused."
"The  petitioner  has  made  the  instant  application  to  canvas  the  order  of"
"refusal  delivered  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  dated  24.11.2020."
"Aggrieved  by  such  order,  the  petitioner  has  come  before  the  Court  of"
"Appeal to invoke the Court’s revisionary jurisdiction."
"At  the  outset,  it  must  be  noted  that  the  revisionary  jurisdiction  of  this"
"Court is a discretionary remedy available to a party who is dissatisfied with"
"an  order  or  judgment  of  a  lower  court  due  to  the  presence  of  some"
"irregularity,  illegality,  absurdity  in  such  order  or  judgment.  Hence,  the"
"primary contention to be determined by this Court is whether or not the"
"impugned order of the learned High Court Judge dated 24.11.2020 is in"
"any way improper to warrant the interference of the Court of Appeal acting"
"in revision."
"A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the learned High Court Judge"
"has correctly insisted on the burden of proving the existence of exceptional"
"circumstances 
to  grant  bail 
to 
the  petitioner.  The 
impugned  order"
"examines three exceptional circumstances submitted by the petitioner: her"
"medical  condition, 
the  plight  of 
the  150  students  enrolled 
in 
the"
"petitioner’s  private  school  specializing  in music  and  dancing  occasioned"
"by the petitioner’s incarceration and the expected delay in concluding the"
"application of appeal. The learned High Court Judge correctly dismissed"
"all 3 grounds for want of exceptionality. The medical reports submitted as"
"proof  of  her  condition  are  dated  between  2005  and  2014;  the  petitioner"
"was  sentenced  in  2020.  Even  in  the  rare  occasion  a  medical  condition"
"would be accepted as an exceptional circumstance, the outdated medical"
"reports  cannot  in  any  way,  be  reliable.  The  party  must  prove  the  nexus"
"between the said medical condition and the immediate danger it poses to"
