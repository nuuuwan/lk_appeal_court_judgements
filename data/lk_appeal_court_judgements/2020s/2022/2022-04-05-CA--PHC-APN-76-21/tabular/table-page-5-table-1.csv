"Anoma Polwatte Case (Supra) was occasioned by a case filed before the"
"Magistrate  Court  under  Section  78(1)  of  the  Bribery  Act  whereby  the"
"Supreme  Court  was  sitting  in  its  writ  jurisdiction  determined  on  the"
"application of Section 11 of the CIABOC Act. The Supreme Court quashed"
"the charge sheet against the petitioner on the basis that a valid directive"
"as  per  Section  11  of  the  CIABOC  Act  was  absent.  Gotabaya  Rajapakse"
"Case (Supra)  concerned  a  revision application wherein the institution of"
"proceedings  under  Section  78  of  the  Bribery  Act  was  impugned.  The"
"judgment  went  on  to  discuss  the  nature  of  the  ‘written  sanction’  as"
"envisaged  by  Section  78  of 
the  Bribery  Act.  The  Court  of  Appeal"
"in Gotabaya Rajapakse Case (Supra) held that the existence of a ‘written"
"sanction’ was a   prerequisite to institute criminal action in the Magistrate"
"Court  under  Section  78  of  the  Bribery  Act  and  held  that  the  Bribery"
"Commission cannot independently institute criminal actions. The instant"
"matter deals with a criminal action instituted in the High Court by way of"
"an indictment under Section 11 of the CIABOC Act. The counsel for the"
"petitioner 
failed 
to  elaborate  on  how 
the  determinations  of  Anoma"
"Polwatte Case (Supra) and Gotabaya Rajapakse Case (Supra) affects the"
"circumstances of the instant application where action has been instituted"
"before  the  High  Court  as  opposed  to  the  Magistrate  Court.  (See  B.  A."
"Ranjan  Somasinghe  v  Director  General,  Commission  to  Investigate"
"Allegations  of  Bribery  or  Corruption  CPA  2/21  CA  Minute  dated"
"11.01.2022).  A mere citing of judgments will not entitle a party to benefit"
"under the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal when the burden"
"placed on such party is to prove exceptional circumstances. The counsel"
"for  the  petitioner  failed  to  demonstrate  the  fundamental  nexus  between"
"the  determinations 
in 
the  cited 
judgments,  which  dealt  with  cases"
"instituted  in  the  Magistrate  Court  and  the  instant  application,  which"
"concerns  an  action  filed  in  the  High  Court.  The  burden  placed  on  the"
"petitioner is to prove that the facts and circumstances of the application"
"is of such exceptionality that it shocks the conscience of this Court. This,"
"the petitioner failed to do."
