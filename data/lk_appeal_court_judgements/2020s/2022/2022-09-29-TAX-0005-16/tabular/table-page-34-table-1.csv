"Accordingly, for the purposes of this case, I will answer the third question"
"of  law  dealing  solely  with  the  facts  relevant  to  this  case.  In  the  case  of"
"Commissioner General of  Inland Revenue  v.  Classic  Travels  (Pvt)  Ltd67"
"this Court expressed the following view regarding an Appellant's right to"
"be  heard  in  an  appeal:  ‘the  word  ""appeal""  refers  to  itself  a  right,  in"
"particular,  for  the  Appellant  to  be  heard.  This  intern  means  that  the"
"Appellant must be afforded an opportunity to present a reasoned argument"
"to persuade the authority concern to re considered his case. One must be"
"able to filed a close link between such hearing and the eventual decision if"
"the authority concerned has genuinely afforded such an opportunity to the"
"Appellant’."
"According to the TAC determination68, the appeal was heard on the 28th"
"July 2015 and the Appellant had been represented by its principal officers"
"including  the  Chairman,  General  Manager  and  the  Managing  Director."
"According to the first written submission filed by the Appellant in the TAC,"
"there  had  been  a  hearing  on  the  5th  June  2014  as  well69.  Moreover,  the"
"Appellant had been given the opportunity to file two written submissions"
"on the 4th of July 2014 and 28th August 201570."
"Hence, I am satisfied that the TAC has given sufficient opportunity to the"
"Appellant to present its case and the decision had been given after a proper"
"hearing."
"Accordingly, I answer the third question of law in the negative, in favour"
"of the Respondent."
