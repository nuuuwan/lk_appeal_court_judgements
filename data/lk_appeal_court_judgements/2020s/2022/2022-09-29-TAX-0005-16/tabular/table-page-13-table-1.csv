"As such, the Assessor has to estimate the amount of ‘assessable income’ in"
"his judgment and then assess the person accordingly. It is obvious that in"
"making the assessment, the Assessor must determine the taxable income"
"and calculate the quantum of income tax payable. No doubt can exist that"
"the  word  ‘assess’  in  Section  163  (3)  (b)  means  the  assessment  of  tax"
"payable."
"The term ‘assessable income’ is defined in the interpretation Section of the"
"IR Act, Section 217, to mean; ‘the residue of the total statutory income of"
"any  person,  after  deducting  the  aggregate  amount  of  the  deduction  to"
"which such person is entitled under Section 32’. The term ‘taxable income’"
"is  defined  to  mean;  ‘the  residue  of  assessable  income  of  a  person  after"
"deducting  the  aggregate  amount  of  allowances  to  which  such  person  is"
"entitled under Section 33’."
"According to the Oxford English Dictionary10 ‘estimate’ means ‘to form"
"an approximate notion of (the amount, number, magnitude, or position of"
"anything) without actual enumeration or measurement; to fix by estimate’."
"Thus, the taxable income estimated by the Assessor which is the basis of"
"the assessment could be more or less the actual income."
"Accordingly, under Section 163 (3), the stages of making an assessment"
"are (i) estimate the amount of assessable income (ii) calculate the taxable"
"income and assess the person (iii) communicate reasons in writing for not"
"accepting the return. The Notice of Assessment under section 164 of the"
"IR  Act  stating  the  amount  of  income  assessed  and  the  amount  of  tax"
"charged must be sent only thereafter."
"Consequently,  where  a  person  has  furnished  a  return  of  income,  if  the"
"Assessor  does  not  accept  the  return,  the  Assessor  should  estimate  the"
"amount of assessable income and assess him accordingly. Further, where"
"such an assessment is made, the Assessor should communicate his reasons"
"for not accepting the return to the Assessee."
"A
s  such,  it  is  clear  that  the  Assessor  is  required  to  send  the  letter  of"
"intimation to the Assessee pursuant to the proviso of Section 163 (3) of the"
"IR Act, only after making an assessment in his judgment."
"Appellant has also stated that the letter issued on the 28th November 2011"
"has to be treated as an intimation issued under Section 163 (3) of the IR"
