"the distinction between an assessment and the Notice of Assessment."
"According  to the  Appellant,  the  letter dated 28th  November  2011 issued"

"M.M.R.R.  Mellawa,  Assessor  and  Ms.  Manjula  Gunathunga,  Deputy"
"Commissioner. The Deputy Commissioner Ms. Manjula Gunathunga has"
"put her signature on the same date 28th November 2011, on the first page"
"and  the  Assessor  Mr.  M.M.R.R.  Mellawa  has  put  his  signature  on  the"
