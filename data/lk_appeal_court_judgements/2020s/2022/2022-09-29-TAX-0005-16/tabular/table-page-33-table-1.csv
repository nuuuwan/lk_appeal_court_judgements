"Whether the Respondent failed to determine the nature of Appellant’s"
"undertaking."
"Another argument advanced by the Appellant was that Respondent, CGIR"
"has not given any determination on the question as to whether the nature"
"of Appellant’s undertaking is within the meaning of Section 45 (2) (c) of"
"the  IR  Act.  The  eighth  question  of  law  flows  from  above.  The  basis  of"
"Appellant’s argument is that the statement made by the CGIR at page 6 of"
"his determination65  to the effect that ‘the Appellant has accepted the fact"
"that the business activity of the Appellant company does not fall within the"
"meaning of undertaking for construction of building as defined in Section"
"45 (2) (c) of the IR Act by keeping silence in respect of the second ground"
"of the petition of appeal’ (sic) is factually incorrect. The above matter had"
"been  raised  by  the  Appellant  in  its  appeal  to  the  TAC66.  The  TAC  has"
"considered the above issue and determined that the electrical installation"
"work of the Appellant does not fall within the meaning of Section 45 of the"
"IR  Act.  Therefore,  the  question  to  be  determined  by  this  Court  is  not"
"whether the above statement of the CGIR is factually correct or incorrect."
"It is important to note that the Appellant has not raised the question before"
"the TAC that the CGIR has failed to make a determination on the above"
"issue. The task of this Court is to see whether the TAC erred in making its"
"determination. Be that as it may, the Appellant’s argument is that in terms"
"of Section 165 (14) of the IR Act, every petition of appeal referred under"
"the Section should be agreed to or determined by the CGIR. It is true that"
"in this instance parties have not reached at an agreement. Yet, may be on"
"an  erroneous  footing,  the  CGIR  has  determined  that  the  Appellant,  by"
"keeping silent in respect of the second ground of appeal, has accepted the"
"fact that the business activity of the Appellant company does not fall within"
"the  meaning  of  undertaking  for  construction  of  buildings  as  defined  in"
"Section 45 (2) (c) of the IR Act."
"Therefore, I am of the view that it cannot be held that the appeal on the"
"above point shall be deemed to have been allowed in terms Section 165"
"(14) of the IR Act, upon the failure of the CGIR to arrive at a determination."
