"In the case of C & E Commissioners v. Ley Rififi Ltd40 it was held that the",""
"assessment of the amount due and the notification of it to the taxpayer are",""
"distinct operations and this is important if an assessment is received after",""
"the expiry of the time limit for assessment. To determine if an assessment",""
"has been ‘made’ within the relevant time limit, should establish the date",""
"when it was assessed and not when the assessment was notified. It was also",""
"observed  that  to  establish  when  an  assessment  was  made,  the  internal",""
"records must be inspected. I do concede that that the procedure in England",""
"was different, where the assessment is ‘made’ when the Inspector of Taxes",""
"authorized  to make the assessment sign the certificate in the assessment",""
"book.  That 
is  because  under","the  Taxes  Management  Act,  1970 
the"
"Inspector of Taxes was obliged to maintain an assessment book. However,",""
"there is no such requirement under the IR Act No.10 of 2006. Yet, as I have",""
"already analysed above, even under the IR Act No. 10 of 2006, the time",""
"bar  is  on  ‘making  the  assessment’  and  not  on  sending  the  ‘Notice  of",""
"Assessment’. Hence, it is important for the Respondent to satisfy the Court",""
"that an assessment has been made prior to the deadline. To ascertain the",""
"above fact, the Court to may have to refer to internal records or any other",""
"available documents which manifest in uncertain terms that an assessment",""
"had been made. In my view, the letter communicating the reasons for not",""
"accepting the return (letter of intimation) satisfies that the assessment had",""
"been made on or before the 28th November 2011.",""
"One  may  argue  that  if  the  time  bar  does  not  apply  to  the  Notice  of",""
"Assessment and applies only to making of an assessment, the Assessor will",""
"be  entitled  to  issue  the  Notice  of  Assessment  at  any  time  as  desires.",""
"However, it is the duty of the Inland Revenue Department to collect taxes",""
"quickly and it is up to the Legislature to fill the gaps in the IR Act that",""
"hinder the course of events. It is not the duty of this Court to read words",""
"into the statute and facilitate such a course.",""
"In view of the above analysis, I hold that the assessment made in the instant",""
"case is not made out time and therefore not a nullity. Accordingly, I hold",""
"that  the  TAC  correctly  determined  that","the  assessment  issued  to  the"
"Appellant is not time barred and therefore I answer the first, second, fourth",""
"and fifth questions of law in the negative, in favour of the Respondent.",""
