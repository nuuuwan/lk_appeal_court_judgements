"N.S. Bindra’s ‘Interpretation of Statutes’ states the following regarding the"
"object of an exemption from taxation:"
"‘It is no doubt the object of an exemption is to narrow the effect of general"
"taxing  words.  But  where  the  taxing  words  are  not  general,  but  special,"

"construed strictly  either  because of legislative intention  or on  economic"
