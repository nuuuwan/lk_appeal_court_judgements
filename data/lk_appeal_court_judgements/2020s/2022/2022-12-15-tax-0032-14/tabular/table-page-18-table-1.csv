"“Next as to the rent. A trader who utilizes, for the purposes of his trade,"
"something belonging to him, be it chattel or real property, which he could"
"otherwise let for money, seems to me to put himself to an expense for the"
"purpose of his trade. Equally he does so if he hires or rents for that purpose"
"property belonging to another. The amount of his expense is prima facie"
"what he could have got for it by letting it in the one case and what he pays"
"for it when hiring it in the other. Where he gets something back for it, while"
"employing it in his trade, by receiving rent or hire for it in connection with"
"that trade, the true amount of his expense can only be arrived at by giving"
"credit for such receipt."
"In principle, therefore, I think that in the present case rent foregone, either"
"by  letting  houses,  which  the  brewers  own,  to  tied  tenants  at  a  low  rent"
"instead  of  to  free  tenants  at  a  full  rack  rent  in  the  open  market,  or  by"
"letting houses in the same way, which they hire and then re let at a loss,"
"is money expended within the first rule applying to both of the first two"
"cases of Schedule D and that upon the findings of the special case, which"
"are conclusive, it is “wholly and exclusively expended for the purposes"
"of such trade”."
