"(3) Did the Tax Appeals Commission fail to properly examine and or apply and"
"or appreciate the facts and the law relevant to this matter?"
"In  respect  of  the  Question  No.  (1),  the  appellant  submits  that  the  TAC  never"
"decided  whether  the  expense  was  deductible  under  section  25(1)(k)  because"
"before the TAC, it was never disputed by the respondent that the expense was"
"deductible under section 25(1)(k) and the only argument of the Respondent was"
"that the expense was not deductible due to section 26(2)."
"In respect of Question No. (2) the appellant submits that the issue in the appeal"
"before the TAC was whether an expenditure especially provided for under section"
"25(1)(k)  which  is  a  special  provision  should  be  deducted  notwithstanding  any"
"prohibition under section 26(2)."
