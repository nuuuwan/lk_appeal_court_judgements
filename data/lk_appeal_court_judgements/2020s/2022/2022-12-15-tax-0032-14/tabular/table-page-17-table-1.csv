"In Usher’s Wiltshire Brewery Ltd., vs. Bruce, 1915 A. C. 433,"
"“Where money is paid by a landlord, being a brewer, or allowed by him to"
"the tenant of a tied house, as a necessary incident of the profitable working"
"of the brewery business, the landlord is not prevented from deducting that"
"money, in his estimate of the balance of profits of his brewery business for"
"the  purposes  of  assessment  to  income  tax,  by  reason  of  the  fact  that  it"
"enures also for the benefit of the tenant’s separate trade in the tied house."
"So held on the authority of Smith vs. Lion Brewery Co. [1911] A. C. 150"
"A brewery company, as a necessary incident of the profitable working of"
"their brewery business, acquired and owned licensed houses which they"
"let to tied tenants, who, in consideration of the tie, paid a rent less than"
"the full annual value. The tenants were under an agreement to repair and"
"to pay rates and taxes, but the company in fact did the repairs and paid"
"rates  and  taxes  in  order  to  avoid  loss  of  tenants.  The  company  also  in"
"respect of these houses paid premiums on insurances against fire and loss"
"of licenses and incurred legal expenses in connection with the renewal of"
"the  licenses  and  otherwise.  All  these  sums  were  solely  and  exclusively"
"expended  or  allowed  by  the  brewery  company  for  the  purposes  of  their"
"business:-"
"Held that, in estimating the balance of the profits of their business for"
"the  purpose  of  assessment  to  income  tax,  the  brewery  company  were"
"entitled to deduct all these sums as expenses necessarily incurred for the"
"purpose of earning the profits."

"Decision of the Court of Appeal [1914] 2 K. B. 891 reversed”."
