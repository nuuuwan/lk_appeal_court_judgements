"His  Lordship  also  referred  to  the  following  passage  from  Lord  Sterndale  M.R.’s"
"judgment as well."
"“An  individual  comes  into  existence  for  many  purposes,  or  perhaps  sometimes  for"
"none,  whereas  a  limited  Company  comes  into  existence  for  some  particular  purpose  of"
"carrying out a transaction by getting possession of concessions and turning them to account,"
"then that is a matter to be considered when you come to decide whether doing that is carrying"
"on a business or not.”"
"In Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. The Westleigh Estates Co. Ltd., The South"
"Behar Railway Co. Ltd., The Eccentric Club Ltd., 12 T.C.657, Lord Sumner held,"
"“It is obvious that the Company’s objects have by no means been accomplished. It is"
"obvious, too, that during its present period of dormant life it has very little to do. I do not"
"attach  much  importance  to  the  domestic  operations  of  declaring  and  paying  dividends,"
"remunerating  directors  and  presenting  reports,  but  the  operation  of  receiving  and  thus"
"discharging the annuity payments goes on continuously, and however simple, it is not a mere"
"passive acquiescence. It is the transaction of business between debtor and creditor resulting"
"periodically in the discharge of a debt. The present is not the case of a company existing to"
"do one act only and once and for all. Not only did the company make the agreement of 1906,"
"but  it  plays  its  recurring  part  in  every  payment  and  receipt  of  gains,  and  there  is  here,"
"therefore, that ‘repetition of acts’, which Lord Justice Brett says is implied in ‘carrying on"
"business’ ”."
"Having referred to these judgments, His Lordship Howard C.J. held,"
"“Applying the principles laid down in the English cases which I have cited there can"
"be no doubt that the appellant company, though functioning as an Investment Company only"
"for which purpose it came into existence, has not accomplished its purpose and was carrying"
"on business. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the income derived by the appellant company"
"from dividends and interest fall within the words “profits from any business” under Section"
"6 (1) (a)[of the old Act]”"
