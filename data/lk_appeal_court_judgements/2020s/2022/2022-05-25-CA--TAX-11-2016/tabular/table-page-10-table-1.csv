"(a) a deduction has been made under section 65 in respect of that dividend by the first"
"mentioned resident company;"
"(b) that dividend is exempt from income tax under section 10;"
"(c) such dividend consists of any part of the amount of a dividend received by the first-"
"mentioned resident company from another resident company; or"
"(d) such dividend is a dividend declared by a quoted public company, profits and"
"i
ncome from such dividend shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other"
"provision of this Act, be deemed not to form part of the total statutory income of the second"
"mentioned company."
"For the purpose of this section the profits and income from such dividends which form"
"part of the profits under section 3(a) of this Act, means profits and income after deducting"
"expenses in ascertaining the profits from such business of receiving dividends."
"Therefore, we hold that both the Respondent and the TAC correctly identified that the"
"dividend constituted part of the statutory income and allowed the deduction of expenses."
"It is true that originally the Legislature was of the view that Section 63 exemption"
"applied only to dividend income within Section 3(e) But there was an amendment to the effect"
"that 
if  dividend 
income 
falls  under  Section  3(a)  then  expenses  are  deductible  when"
"determining assessable income."
"When  considering  the  material  before  it,  this  Court  observes  that  throughout  the"
"Appellant wanted to claim the benefit of Section 63(d), by categorizing it under Section 3(e),"
"but to have the expenses incurred in the production of that dividend income to be deducted"
"from their income, which derived from the dividend income. The conduct of the Appellant is"
"an example of the proverb that ‘you cannot have the cake and eat it too’."
"Question  5:  Is  the  amount  assessed,  as  confirmed  by  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission"
"excessive and without lawful justification?"
"Question 6: In view of the facts and circumstances of the case did the Tax Appeals"
"Commission err in law when it came to the conclusion that it did?"
