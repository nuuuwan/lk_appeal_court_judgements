"a carrying out of Port, and thus include carrying commodities"
"from one port to another within the Kingdom (Stockton Ry v."
"Barrett 11 C1. &F. 590: Vth Dwar. 648, 691).”"
"“Exported-  “Exported”  means,  “carried  out”;  therefore,"
"dues on “coals exported” from a Port are payable on coal to"

"L. J. Q. B. 164).”"
