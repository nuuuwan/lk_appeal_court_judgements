"","ridden  by  the  2nd  deceased  Saman  Kumara  (the  deceased  in"
"","count  no.  2)  at  about  7:00  pm.  A  few  minutes  later,  the  2nd"
"","deceased  has  returned  alone  and  started  shouting  in  filth.  The"
"","appellant  has 
then  come  running 
towards 
the  2nd  deceased."
"","Then 
the  1st  deceased  Manjula  Prasanna  Siriwardena  (the"

"","appellant  has  stabbed  the  1st  deceased.  When  the  1st  deceased"
"","fell down, the appellant has cut the 2nd deceased also with the"
"","knife."
"3.  When","the  defence  was  called, 
the  appellant  had  made  an"
