"his  evidence  was  never  challenged  by 
the  defence.  It  was"
"further submitted, that the defence taken up by the appellant in"
"his dock statement  was never put  to the prosecution witnesses"
"in  cross  examination.  It  was  his  contention  that  the  learned"
"High  Court  Judge  has  considered  lesser  culpability,  but  the"
"evidence has not revealed lesser culpability."
"6.  PW4 can be considered as an independent witness who saw the"
"incident.  Although  he  was  cross  examined  at  length  by  the"
"defence  Counsel 
in 
the  High  Court,  his  evidence  was  not"
"challenged.  He  was  consistent.  It  was  his  evidence  that  the"
"villagers  flocked  upon  hearing  the noise  and  got  the  appellant"
"under  control. 
If  not 
for 
the  villagers  who  controlled 
the"
"appellant, 
the 
appellant  would  have 
stabbed 
some  more"
"persons, the witness testified (page 113 of the appeal brief). He"
"has given clear evidence as to how the appellant caused injuries"
"to both the deceased."
"7.  Where the controversy is about veracity of witnesses, immense"
"importance 
attaches, 
not 
only 
to 
the 
demeanour 
of 
the"
"witnesses,  but  also  to  the  course  of  the  trial,  and  the  general"
"impression  left  on  the  mind  of  the  Judge  of  1st  instance,  who"
"saw and noted everything that took place in regard to what was"
"said by one or other witness. It is rare that a decision of a Judge"
"of  1st  instance  upon  a  point  of  fact  purely  is  over-ruled  by  a"
"Court of Appeal. (Fradd v. Brown & CO., LTD. 20 NLR 283)"
"8.  The 1st deceased Manjula Prasanna Siriwardena has received a"
"stab injury on the abdomen, penetrating the cavity. He also has"
"received  another  cut 
injury  on 
the 
right  elbow.  The  2nd"
"deceased  Saman  Kumara  has  received      stab  injuries  on  the"
"neck  and 
the  chest. 
  The  stab 
injuries  caused  on  both 
the"
"deceased  reflects  the  murderous  intention  of  the  appellant.  In"
"his  statement  from  the  dock,  the  appellant  has  admitted  his"
"presence  at  the  scene,  and  has  admittedly  swerved  the  knife,"
"although  he  did  not  admit  causing  injuries  to  the  deceased"
"deliberately."
"9.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  in  his  judgment  has  carefully"
"considered 
and 
analyzed 
not 
only 
the 
evidence 
by 
the"
"prosecution, but also the dock statement made by the appellant."
"In his judgment  at page  27 (page 342 of the appeal  brief), the"
