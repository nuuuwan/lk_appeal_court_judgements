"Even  though  the  Appellants  argued  regarding  the  corpus  in  this  court,  a  perusal  of  the  issue"
"accepted for trial dated 11.01.1989 does not have any issue raised on the identity of the corpus."
"Issue No.1 was raised by Plaintiff regarding the schedule to amend the Plaint, which the learned"
"Judge had answered in the affirmative, giving reasons and referring to documents."
"The  learned  District  Judge  had  discussed  the  pedigree  of  the  Plaintiff,  referring  to  documents"
"produced  at  the  trial  and  emphasising  the  failure  of  the  Defendants  to  show  any  lapses  in  the"
"pedigree. He had discussed the plan marked as “P3” and identified the 3rd schedule, not the Plaint"
"in  “P3”,  which  is  as  way  back  as  1904,  referring  to  case  No.4817/P.  At  the  District  Court  of"
"Panadura,  the  learned  Judge  had  observed  that  documents  produced  in  that  case  by  the  3d"
"Defendant do not depict premises No.333, but the documents of the Plaintiff reveal the existents"
"of the premises in the documents before that case."
"However, referring to case No.4817, the learned Judge had pointed out that the 3rd Defendant’s"
"documents do not speak of premises No.333 mentioned in the case. The learned District Judge had"
"pointed out why the Plaintiff’s claim was more substantial than the claim of the 3rd Defendant."
"The argument  regarding  the  identity of the  corpus placed before  the  court  cannot  be gone into"
"because that was not an issue before the District Court. None of the Appellants had raised such an"
"issue. However, as pointed out above, the District Judge has identified the corpus."
"For the reasons discussed above, I see no reason to disturb the judgment dated 27.09.2000 by the"
"learned District Judge of Panadura entered in case No.14192/L."
"The appeal is dismissed; I make no order for costs."
