"MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J."
"The  instant  appeal  from  143/16  to  163/16  has  been  filed  to  set  aside  the"
"order  dated  06.09.2016  of  the  High  Court  of  Kuliyapitiya.  Therefore  it  was"
"agreed  by  both  parties  that  one  judgment  would  be  applicable  to  all  the"
"appeals from 143/16 to 163/16."
"The appellant in the instant matter has held the power of attorney for a land"
"belonging to his sister who had been residing in the United States of America."
"The appellant is supposed to have obtained the services of the 1st accused of"
"the  case  in  the  magistrateâ€™s  Court  of  Kuliyapitiya  by  the  number  66575  to"
"dispose the land.  Several buyers had come forward to purchase the land and"
"the appellant had signed over the deeds pertaining to those plots. But, several"
"other  persons  had  complained  to  the  police  against  the  first  accused  and"
"three others for taking over their money and not giving the land. Therefore,"
"Police  had  reported  facts  on  numerous  occasions  against  the  said  suspects."
"The Magistrate on several occasions had taken steps to settle the matter, but"
"it  had  failed.  Thereafter,  the  Magistrate  had  for  some  reason  instructed  the"
"police to add the appellant as the 5thaccused in the matter. The appellant had"
"surrendered himself to the Magistrate."
"Therefore,  the  appellant  alleges  that  he  was  added  as  an  accused  without"
"even his statement being recorded."
"Therefore  he  further  averred 
in  Court  that  the  matter 
in  hand  was  not"
"properly  investigated  and  the  Magistrate  did  not  have  sufficient  material  to"
"frame  a  charge  against 
the  appellant.  The  Magistrate  had  charged 
the"
"appellant along with the four others under Section 389 and 403 of the  Penal"
"Code."
