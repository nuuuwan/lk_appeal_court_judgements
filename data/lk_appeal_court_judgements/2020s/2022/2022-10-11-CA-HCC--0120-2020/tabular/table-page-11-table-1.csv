"As  the  grounds  of  appeal  considered  above  have  merits  which  certainly"
"disturb the judgment of the Learned High court judge, it is not necessary to"
"address the remaining ground of appeal further."
"In this case the prosecution has failed to adduce corroborative evidence in"
"material  particulars  by  evidence  from  an  independent  source  which  is,  of"
"course,  a  statutory  requirement  under  Section  163  A  (5)  of  the  Evidence"
"(Special Provisions) Act No.32 of 1999. Further irregular procedure had been"
"followed  by  the  prosecution  in  violation  of  Section  163  A  (3)  (b)  of  the"
"Evidence  (Special  Provisions)  Act,  No.32  of  1999.  As  these  are  substantial"
"facts, it certainly affects the root of the case."
"Considering  all  the  circumstances  discussed  above,  this  court  could  only"
"come to the conclusion that the prosecution has not proven the case beyond"
"reasonable doubt. Therefore, the Appellant is acquitted from the charge."
"The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside."
"The Registrar of this court is directed to send a copy of this judgment along"
"with the original case record to the High Court of Colombo."
