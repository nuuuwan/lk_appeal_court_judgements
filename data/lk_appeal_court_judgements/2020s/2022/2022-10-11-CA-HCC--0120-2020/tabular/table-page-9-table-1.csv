"by the evidence of PW4, PW18 and PW20. But their evidence only shows the"
"“consistency” of the prosecutrix’s evidence which certainly strengthens her"
"credibility. Therefore, I conclude that this ground of appeal has merit."
"In the second ground of appeal, the Learned President’s Counsel contends"
"that  the  prosecution  had 
followed  a  totally 
illegal  procedure  when  the"
"evidence of the prosecutrix was led before the court."
"After tendering the video recorded testimony of the prosecutrix and before"
"the cross examination of the defence, the State Counsel made an application"
"to the trial court to lead some evidence in brief which had not been dealt in"
"the  video  recorded  testimony  of  the  prosecutrix.  Although  the  Court  had"
"granted permission to lead some evidence briefly, the State Counsel had led"
"lengthy  evidence  which  might  have  been  put  in  cross  examination  by  the"
"defence. For this the State Counsel did not seek permission from the court"
"under  Section  154  of 
the  Evidence  Ordinance.  Further,  nowhere 
the"
"prosecution had declared that the victim as a hostile witness."
