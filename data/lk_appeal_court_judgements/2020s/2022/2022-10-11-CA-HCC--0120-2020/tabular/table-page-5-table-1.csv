"required by law as the prosecutrix had gone back on her statement, which"
"had  been  recorded  on  the  video.  Hence  the  learned  President’s  Counsel"
"strenuously argued that the prosecution had not proven the case against the"
"Appellant beyond reasonable doubt."
"Corroborating  evidence  is  the  proof  which  strengthens  or  confirms  the"
"evidence  which  already  exists.  Such  independent  evidence  backs  up  the"
"testimony of a witness."
