"is based on the principle that every man is presumed to be innocent until"
"the contrary is proved, and criminality is never to be presumed.‚Äù"
"In this matter the evidence of the PW-02 had been that when she and the decoy"
"met  the  appellant,  she  told  them  to  give  the  money  to  her  husband  who  was"
"working in the Post Office but later told them to come and meet her at her home."
"It  was  her  evidence  that  when  they  showed  reluctance  to  come,  the  appellant"
"informed them to come near the Post Office and she will be waiting there. When"
"they  could  not  meet  her  at  the  Post  Office,  she  called  the  appellant  using  the"
"phone of the decoy and she was told to give the money to her husband, and when"
"she called again and informed the appellant that the husband was not available,"
"she was instructed to give the money to Wijeratne. It is not clear how the PW-02"
"knew  the  mobile  phone  number  of  the  appellant  as  it  was  not  she  who  was"
"dealing  with  the  appellant,  unless  her  husband  was  also  with  her  or  he  was"
"contacted  before  making  the  calls  to  the  appellant  as  this  was  an  unexpected"
"development. There is no evidence in that regard."
"Contrary to this evidence the position of the decoy had been that when they went"
"and met the appellant, she asked them whether the money was ready and later"
"said come to her home in the evening and when they hesitated told them to come"
"near  the  post  office.  It  was  her  evidence  that  when  they  could  not  meet  the"
"appellant near the Post Office and called her it was informed that the money can"
"be given to Wijeratne. She has failed to say anything about appellant telling them"
"to give the money to her husband as stated by the PW-02 in her evidence."
"I am of the view that given the contradictory nature of the evidence of the PW-02"
"and the decoy in this regard, the stand of the appellant as to what happened on"
"that day cannot be excluded."
