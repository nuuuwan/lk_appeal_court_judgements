"It was held in the case of Alim Vs. Wijesinghe (S.I. Police, Batticaloa) 38 CLW"

"In the case of The Queen Vs. M.G. Sumanasena 66 NLR 350 it was held:"
"“In a criminal case suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt. Nor does"
"the proof of any number of suspicious circumstances relieve the prosecution"
"of  its  burden  of  proving  the  case  against  the  accused  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt and compel the accused to give or call evidence”"
"I  am  of  the  view  that  although  there  are  strong  suspicions  directed  at  the"
"appellant in this case as to the second and the third counts preferred against"
"her, given the above infirmities in the evidence, it is not safe to let the conviction"
"of her in the said counts to stand."
"For the aforementioned reasons, I set aside the conviction and the sentence of"
"the appellant on the third and the fourth counts preferred against her and acquit"
"her of the said counts and allow the appeal up to that extent."
"As I find no reasons to interfere with the conviction of her on the first and the"
"second counts preferred against her as stated earlier, I affirm the conviction on"
"those counts by the learned High Court Judge."
"However, since the appellant is now stands convicted only for the solicitation of"
"a bribe, given the fact that she has had no previous convictions and the fact that"
"she will not be able to enjoy any benefit as a government servant, it is the view"
"of this Court that incarcerating her is no longer warranted."
