"PW-01, his wife PW-02 and their son was there, and PW-02 agreed to participate"
"in the raid."
"The evidence of PW-02 had been that she was at home washing clothes when"
"her husband came and wanted her to take part in the operation. It is clear that"
"she had been a reluctant participant,  but had accompanied her husband and"
"child and met the bribery officials. I find that due to these contradictory evidence"
"as to the way the whole operation was initiated on the 24th of February casts a"

"school office, the appellant has initially failed to recognize the PW-02 as she has"
"met her only once previously. In my view, it is not safe to conclude that a person"
"like the appellant will openly discuss about the money she was expecting from"
"PW-01 with someone not familiar to her who has come with another  stranger,"
"considering  the  behaviour  of  her  when the  solicitation  of  the  gratification  was"
"made."
"If  the  acceptance  of  the  money  was  directly  by  the  appellant  the  necessary"

"was not privy to it."
"It  is  therefore  necessary  for  the  prosecution  to  eliminate  all  the  reasonable"
"doubts that can arise as to the giving of the bribe."
