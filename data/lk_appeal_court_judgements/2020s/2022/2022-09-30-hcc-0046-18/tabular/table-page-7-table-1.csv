"home, but when they showed reluctance again, she had informed that she will"
"be going near the post office and come there."
"Later  in  her  evidence,  PW-02  has  stated  that  she  and  the  decoy  PW-04,  went"
"near the post office to meet the appellant but she was not there. When contacted"
"using the mobile phone of the decoy, the appellant informed her the money can"
"be  given  to  her  husband  Prasanna.  After  inquiring  for  Prasanna  who  was  not"
"there at the post office at that time, PW-02 has taken another call using the same"
"phone of the decoy where the appellant was supposed to have told to give the"
"money to a person called Wijeratne, who is a person working at the post office."
"Although she was reluctant to give the money to the person called Wijeratne, the"
"money has been ultimately given to him after placing it in an envelope obtained"
"from the post office. PW-02 has given evidence stating that to her recollection,"
"the  money  was  in  1000-rupee  denominations.  She  has  also  stated  in  her"
"evidence that when she and the decoy went and met the appellant at her office,"
"she showed them a letter by the relevant Ministry approving the admission of"
"their child to the school."
"At  the  time  of  giving  the  money  to  Wijeratne,  the  officials  from  the  Bribery"
"Commission have come and arrested the said Wijeratne and subsequently, they"
"have gone to the appellantâ€™s house and arrested her for accepting a bribe through"
"the said Wijeratne."
"The earlier mentioned Yapa Wijeratne (PW-03) has given evidence in this action,"
"and has confirmed that he accepted the parcel because Prasanna, the husband"
"of the appellant wanted him to accept that and keep it with him until he come"
"and collect it. He also confirms that, before accepting the parcel, the two ladies"
"who  wanted  to  handover  the  parcel  took  a  call  to  the  appellant  and  she  too"
"informed him to accept the parcel. He has denied that he knew what was in the"
"parcel,  but  has  admitted  that  after  the  raid,  the  contents  of  the  parcel  were"
"shown to him and that there were 5000-rupee notes inside."
