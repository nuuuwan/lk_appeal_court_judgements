 The obligation to approach the Court with clean hands is an absolute"
"obligation and has repeatedly been reiterated by this Court…..”"
"Their Lordships of the Supreme Court further observed,"
"“The person seeking equity must do equity. It is not just the clean hands,"
"but  also  clean mind,  clean  heart  and  clean  objective  that  are  the  equi-"

"become a source of abuse of the process of law by the disgruntled litigant. Careful"

"In the instant case, the Plaintiff successfully litigated the case and obtained"
"judgment in her favour in 2019. After winning the battle, to date, she is deprived"
"of the fruits of that. Is it not an abuse of process to simply file an application for"
"restitutio-in-integrum asking for a stay order depriving the Plaintiff of the fruits"
"of her successful litigation?"
