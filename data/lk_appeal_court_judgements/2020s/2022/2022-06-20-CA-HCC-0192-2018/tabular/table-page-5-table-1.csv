"In the evidence of PW1 it revealed that he had managed a small temple in"
"which to perform rituals intended to ward off demons and evil spirits from"
"an  individual  or  a  location.  As  usual  after  attending  to  his  clients  he  had"
"closed his temple for the public and had been making his way to his house"
"which 
is  also  situated  on  the  same  premises  when  two  persons  had"
"approached  him  with  the  intention  of  getting  a  king  coconut  blessed.  The"
"time  was  between  11.30-12.00  mid  night  on  05/05/1992.  Both  have  had"
"helmets in their possession. Suddenly, the Appellant accusing PW1 of being"
"a  bogus  ritual  performer,  pushed  the  witness  in  to  a  small  boutique  and"
"demanded his gold chain which he usually wore. At that time however, PW1"
"has not been wearing the chain as he had removed it after work. Due to the"
"commotion that ensued, his sons, daughter and his sister had rushed to the"
"scene immediately. The Appellant had then threatened the witness with an"
"object resembling a bomb and the other person had been armed with a pistol."
"The  other  person  too  had  demanded  gold  jewellery  from  the  witness.  The"
"Appellant was standing close to the boutique while the others had stood few"
"steps  away  from  the  witness.  Then  the  Appellant  had  demanded  PW1’s"
"sister’s gold chain and had proceeded to remove it. At that time when this"
"witness had tried to restrain the Appellant, the deceased had come out from"
"his house to save him. Suddenly the other person who had possessed a gun"
"opened fire on the deceased and he had fallen to the ground. As the place of"
"incident was properly lit up with bright lights, he had been able to witness"
"the  sequence  of  events  very  clearly.  When  the  Appellant  along  with  other"
"person  tried  to  escape  after  the  shooting,  the  people 
in  the  area  had"
"apprehended the Appellant and had proceeded to hand him over to the police"
"with the motor bike and the two helmets that had been in the possession of"
"the two perpetrators."
"During cross examination this witness had said that when he grabbed the"
"Appellant the other person had threatened him to release the Appellant."
