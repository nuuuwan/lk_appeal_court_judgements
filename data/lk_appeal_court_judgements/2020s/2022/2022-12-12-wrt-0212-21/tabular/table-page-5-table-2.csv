"permit."

Any  disposition  or  nomination  made  by  a  spouse  in  contravention  of  the"
"provisions of subsection (2) shall be invalid.” [emphasis added]"
"In view of Section 48A (1) of the Land Development Ordinance cited above,"
"upon the death of the initial permit holder K.A. Andrew, his spouse Kirimenika"
"becomes legally entitled to succeed to the land which was alienated to said"
"K.A.  Andrew  as  a  permit-holder 
irrespective  of 
the 
fact  whether  said"
"Kirimenika was the nominated successor to the land or not. It is on common"
"grounds that after the death of the K.A. Andrew his spouse said Kirimenika"
"became the permit holder of the impugned land."
"However, 
in 
the  given  circumstances,  Kirimenika  was 
the  nominated"
"successor of K.A. Andrew to the land in dispute. As such, in terms of Section"
"48A  (2)  read  with  its  proviso,  upon  the  death  of  the  said  K.A.  Andrew,  his"
"spouse Kirimenika was legally entitled to a grant and to succeed to the land"
"alienated  on  the  permit,  free  from  any  conditions  specified  therein.  In  the"
"above context, it is observed that said Kirimenika has been issued with a Deed"
"of Grant (Jaya Bhumi Deed) marked P7 to the Petition by the State. Therefore,"
"any alienation of succession rights of the land in dispute should be devolved"
"on the basis that the Kirimenika was the due owner of the impugned land."
"The  Petitioner’s  contention 
is  that  the  said  succession  rights  should  be"
"devolved  on  the  basis  that  the  initial  permit  holder  K.A.  Andrew  was  the"
"owner of the impugned land. Such an argument would have some weight as"
"per the said Section 48(2)(c) if the initial permit holder K.A. Andrew had not"
"nominated her wife Kirimenika as successor by the P3. Because, in terms of"
"Section 48(2)(c) of the Ordinance, if such K.A. Andrew had in the event where"
"a permit holder passes away without nominating a successor, such property"
