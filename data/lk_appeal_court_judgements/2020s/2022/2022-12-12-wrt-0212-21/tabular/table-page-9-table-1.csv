"denial  of  the  legitimate  expectation  of  the  Petitioner  that  she  would  be"
"appointed as the rightful successor of the land as she is the eldest child of the"
"original permit holder K.A. Andrew. In support of this position, Petitioner drew"
"the attention of this court to the consideration of the recent amendment to"
"the Ordinance by Act No. 11 of 2022. As per the said amendment, Rule 1(d)(i)"
"specifies,  where  any  person 
in  the  order  of  priority 
in  which  they  are"
"respectively mentioned in the subjoined table developed such land, the title"
"to the holding or the land shall not devolve on the older person referred to in"
"paragraph  (b)  but  on  the  person  who  developed  such  land.    However,  the"
"above  amendment  came  into  operation  subsequent  to  the  decision  dated"
"13.02.2019  (P15)  of  the  Divisional  Secretary  and  the  amendment  does not"
"specify  that  it  shall  operate  in  retrospective  effect.  As  such,  the  Divisional"
"Secretary has acted in accordance with the law that prevailed at the time of"
"the decision."
"A legitimate expectation would arise only on a legal basis. In the event, where"
"the law is clear that where an owner dies without leaving behind her spouse"
"and without nominating a successor, the title to the impugned land should"
"devolve to the eldest son of such owner, the Petitioner is not entitled to hold"
"a 
legitimate  expectation  purely  on  an 
illegitimate  basis.  Therefore,  the"
"Petitioner cannot claim that she has a legitimate expectation that she would"
"be appointed as the rightful successor against the said lawful decision."
"It is also note worthy that the Divisional Secretary has offered parties in view"
"of settlement to share the property in dispute and that the same was denied"
"by the Petitioner."
"The Petitioner relies on the decision of the case of Rajapaksha Vs. Temawathie"
"Appeal No. 125/2010 where Saleem Marsoof J. formed an opinion in respect"
"of the table in the third schedule of the Land Development Ordinance to the"
"it,  the  provisions  of  the  third  schedule  appear  to  be 
effect  that,  â€œOn  the  face  of"
"discriminatory on the ground of sex, but was probably fashioned by the assumption that it"
"is  the  men  in  the  family  who  actually  participate  in  cultivation,  the  validity  of  which"
"assumption  may  be  questioned  in  the  context  of  this  case,  where  it  appears  from  the"
"evidence that the respondents, both were females had cultivated the land in dispute with"
"the assistance of the family members including the brothers. I am of the opinion that the"
"provision  has  to  be  reviewed  by  the  policy  makers  in  the  light  of  realities  of  the  day  in"
"particular articular article 12 of the constitution."
