"rendered any service to any person or partnership outside Sri Lanka, and not"
"to  any 
local  branch  office, 
the  Appellant  cannot  be  disentitled 
to 
the  tax"
"exemption  in  section  13  (dddd)  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  on  the  basis  of"
"conditions  for  the  VAT  liability  under  section  7(1)(c)  of  the  VAT  Act  are  not"
"satisfied by the Appellant."
"[82] The Assessor, the CGIR and the TAC have erroneously decided that the"
"Appellant  has  not  provided  any  service  to  Mabey  &  Johnson  Ltd,  UK  and"
"other 
companies 
despite 
clear 
documentary 
evidence, 
including 
the"
"Agreements  and  the  invoices  having  been  submitted  to  the  Assessor  by  the"
"Appellant  during  the  assessment  process.    In  my  view  the  Appellant  has"
"satisfied  that  it  rendered  services  to  Mabey  &  Johnson  Ltd,  UK  and  seven"
"other  companies  outside  Sri  Lanka  and  received  commission 
income 
in"
"foreign currency through a bank. Accordingly, I am of the view that the profits"
"and  income  earned  by  the  Appellant  from  the  provision  of  the  services  to"
"Mabey & Johnson Ltd, UK and  seven other foreign companies fall within the"
"scope  and  ambit  of  the  tax  exemption  in  section  13  (dddd)  of  the  Inland"
"Revenue Act."
"Failure to comply with section 106 (11) of the Inland Revenue Act"
"[83]  The 
learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  however,  submitted  at 
the"
"hearing, without prejudice to his submissions that even if the Appellant is held"
"to be entitled to claim a tax exemption under section 13 (dddd) of the Act, the"
"Appellant  is  not  entitled  to  the  said  exemption,  as  a  result  of  its  failure  to"
"comply with section 106 (11) of the Act."
"[84]  He  concedes,  however,  that  the  non-compliance  with  section  106  (11)"
"was not raised as a specific question of law by the Respondent, but since, the"
"matter was raised by the Appellant in its written submissions, he invited us to"
"deny  the  exemption  for  non-compliance  with  section  106  (11)  of  the  Inland"
"Revenue Act. His submission is that the Appellant has several businesses as"
"detailed 
in 
the  schedules 
to 
the 
financial  statement 
(p.  14-18)  but 
the"
"Appellant has failed to maintain and prepare separate accounts in a manner"
"that 
the  profits  and 
income 
from  each  such  activity  could  be  separately"
"identified."
"[85] He relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in  ICCI Bank Limited v."
"The  Commissioner  General  of 
Inland  Revenue,  CA,  Tax,  Np.  28 
/2013"
"decided on  16.07.2015  in  support  of his  submission. Section 106  (11)  of  the"
"Inland  Revenue  Act,  No.  10  of  2006,  which  applies  in  the  relevant  period"
"reads as follows:"
