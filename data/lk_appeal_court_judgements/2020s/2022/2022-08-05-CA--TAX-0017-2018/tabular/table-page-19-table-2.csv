"Contracting  State,  or  which  carries  on  business 
in 
that  other  State"
"(whether  through  a  permanent  establishment  or  otherwise)  shall  not  of"
"itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other."
"[45]  An  enterprise  cannot  be  deemed 
to  have  created  a  permanent"
"establishment in Sri Lanka in terms of Article 5(3) of the DTTA between UK"
"and Sri Lanka, merely because it has a fixed place of business or it maintains"
"such  a  fixed  place,  unless,  it  carried  on  its  business  through  a  PE  in  Sri"
"Lanka.  The mere registration or existence or maintenance of a fixed place of"
"business, 
including 
the  mere  preparation  or  auxiliary  character 
in 
the"
"business or acceptance of documents,would be insufficient to create a PE in"
"Sri Lanka unless it can be shown that branch office also carries on business"
"in Sri Lanka from that fixed place of business."
"[46] In my view, Mabey & Johnson Co. Ltd, UK cannot be deemed to have a"
"PE  in  Sri  Lanka  merely  because  of  the  existence  of  a  branch  office  in  Sri"
"Lanka under the provisions of the Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007, unless it"
"can be shown that the local branch office carried on business in Sri Lanka."
"[47] In the present case, apart from the fact that Mabey & Johnson Co. Ltd,"
"has  a  branch  office  in  Sri  Lanka  and  it  has  changed  its  address  of  the"
"principal place of business under section 491 of the Companies Act, No. 07"
"of  2007, 
there 
is  absolutely  no  evidence  such  as  bank  statements  and"
"financial statements to show that the branch office carried on any business"
"in Sri Lanka either from its previous address, at Level 8, East Tower, World"
"Trade  Centre,  Colombo  01  or  at  the  new  address  at  No.  85/2,  Main  Street,"
"Battaramulla."
"[48]  The  TAC  has  taken  the  erroneous  view  that  the  mere  presence  of  a"
"branch office in Sri Lanka, based on the clause 10.3 of the Contract, the form"
"issued under section 491 of the Companies Act and the letter of the Director,"
"RDA, ipso facto established that Mabey & Johnson Co. Ltd had a PE in Sri"
"Lanka. The TAC clearly expanded the scope of section 13 (dddd) by adding"
"the 
the  words  “completely  outside  Sri  Lanka”,  which  arenotused  by"
"Legislature.  Such  hypothetical  construction,  in  my  view  is  inconsistent  with"
"the object and the policy of the Inland Revenue Act."
"[49]  The  TAC,in  my  view 
totally 
failed 
to  consider 
that 
there 
is  no"
"documentary evidence whatsoever, to  show that the local branch carried on"
"its  business  in  Sri  Lanka  and  unless,  it  carried  on  business  in  Sri  Lanka,  it"
"cannot constitute a permanent establishment in Sri Lanka within the meaning"
"of  the  definition  of  “permanent  establishment”  in  Article  5  (1)  of  the  DTTA"
"between the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka."
