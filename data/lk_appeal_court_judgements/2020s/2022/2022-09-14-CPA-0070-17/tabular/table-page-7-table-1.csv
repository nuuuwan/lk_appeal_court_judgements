"6  must  be  read 
in  consonance  with 
the  rest  of  the  Ordinance.  Had  the"
"legislature  intended to import  the  recognition as an  ‘archaeological  site’ within"
"Section  6,  the  legislature  would  have  referred  to  Sections  24  or  33  of  the"
"Ordinance.  The 
former  refers  to  prohibited  areas 
in  the  vicinity  of  certain"
"monuments designated by regulations, and the latter archaeological reserves as"
"specified  by  Gazette  notifications. 
Instead,  a  blanket  recognition  has  been"
"against  unlicensed  excavations,  either  on  private  land  or  otherwise,  for  the"
"purpose of discovering antiquities. Hence, going by the precise, unambiguous"
"wording of Section 6 of the Ordinance, the existence or otherwise of antiquities"
"in the excavation site is immaterial for a conviction under Section15(1)(a) of the"
"Ordinance. No distinction has been made in Section 6 of the Ordinance between"
"‘archaeological  sites’  and  ‘non-archaeological  sites’,  but  rather  the  legislature"
"has  focused  on  the  mental  element  of  the  person  conducting  the  excavation,"
"i.e.,  purpose.  In  assessing  what  constitutes  the  ‘purpose’,  one  must  note  that"
"the  inability  to  achieve  the  result  of  the  purpose  does  not  vitiate  the  purpose"
"itself. Hence, the question that needs to be answered is whether the respondent"
"has excavated for the purpose of discovering antiquities."
"The respondent in his written submissions has failed to provide any reasons as"
"to why the respondent ‘intended’ to excavate the site in the first place, if not for"
"the  purpose  of  discovering  antiquities. 
In  any  event, 
the  purpose  of 
the"
"excavation  can  be  ascertained  from  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case."
"The  respondent 
is  a 
labourer  at 
the  Department  of  Archaeology.  This 
is"
"indicative  of 
the  respondent’s  knowledge  of 
the  gravity  of  conducting  an"
"unlicensed  excavation  for  the  purpose  of  discovering  antiquities.  Unlike  an"
"ordinary  person,  the  respondent  ought  to  know  that  antiquities  cannot  be"
"restored  once  damaged  or  otherwise  removed.  The  respondent  has  pleaded"
"guilty to the charges levelled against him under the Ordinance, and it is hard to"
"assume  that  he  was  unaware  of  the  nature  and  gravity  of  the  offence  he  has"
"been  charged  with.  Moreover,  the  respondent  has  paid  off  the  fine  imposed"
"upon  him  by  the  Magistrate.  Added  to  this  knowledge,  the  location  of  the"
"excavation, which is in close proximity to an ancient tank, the premeditation as"
