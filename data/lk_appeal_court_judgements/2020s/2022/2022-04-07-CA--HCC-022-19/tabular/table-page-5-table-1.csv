"produced to her to identify. The learned Senior State Counsel contended"
"in reply that as PW1, PW4 and PW5 have identified the said production,"
"not  producing  the  same  to  be  identified  by  PW7  does  not  cause  any"
"prejudice to the prosecution case."
"A
s  the  PW7  had  recovered  production  from  the  possession  of  the"
"appellant, it is better if she had also identified the production. However,"
"PW7 has not examined the contents that were in the pink colour bag"
"she 
found.  So  even 
if 
the  productions  are  presented 
to  her 
for"
"identification, she can only identify that it was the pink colour bag that"
"was on the outside of the parcel. PW1, PW4 and PW5 were there at the"
"time of recovering the productions. Those 3 witnesses have  identified"
"that  the  pink  colour  bag  which  was  produced  in  court  was  the  bag"
"recovered  from  the  possession  of  the  appellant  in  which  Heroin  was"
"found  inside  subsequently.  Therefore,  not  identifying  the  pink  colour"
"bag by PW7 has not caused any prejudice to the prosecution case."
"I
n  the  instant  action,  the  learned  counsel  appeared  for  the  accused-"
"appellant in the High Court has informed that the appellant does not"
"admit the  chain of  productions. At least,  the learned counsel did not"
"admit  the  Government  Analyst  Report  without  calling  an  officer  from"
"the  Government  Analyst  Department 
in  evidence.  Therefore, 
the"
"prosecution had to call the retired Government Analyst to give evidence."
"However,  neither  her  evidence  nor  the  contents  of  the  Government"
"Analyst report were challenged when she was cross-examined. Only six"
"questions have been asked in cross-examination. Those questions are"
"also relevant to the percentage of the weight of the Heroin. Therefore, it"
"is  precisely  clear 
that 
the  Government  Analyst  Report  was  not"
"challenged in any manner and the said report could have been easily"
"admitted without calling the retired Government Analyst to the courts."
"A
t this stage, it is pertinent to note that trial Judges do not make use"
"of amended Section 414 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Section"
"5"
