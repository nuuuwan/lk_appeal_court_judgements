"showing cause as to why the vehicle should not be confiscated, only the person who"
"was in possession and control of the vehicle could give evidence to the effect that the"
"offence was committed without his knowledge and he had taken necessary steps to"
"prevent the commission of the offence.‚Äù"
"Therefore, the same doubt in ownership relied upon by the learned Magistrate and"
"the learned High Court Judge to confiscate and affirm the confiscation of the"
"vehicle has been established before this Court as well. The appellant has"
"contradicted himself in proving the control and possession of the vehicle during the"
"cross-examination. From the evidence given by the appellant, it is unclear whether"
"the appellant was in actual possession and control of the vehicle, to regard him as"
"the owner under the Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance."
"Therefore,  this  Court  finds  no  reason  to  intervene  with  the  order  of  confiscation"
"delivered by  the learned  Magistrate  dated  03.08.2016  and  the judgment  affirming"
"the same delivered by the learned High Court Judge of Kandy."
"Appeal dismissed"
