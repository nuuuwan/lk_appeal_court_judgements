"Inasmuch as the court has to approach the issue relating to the liberty of the"
"subject by giving a strict interpretation of the law and the same approach"
"has  to  be  aimed  at  resolving  the  issues  relating  to  the  legality  of  the"
"confiscation orders as well…….”."
"On the other hand, the role of the judge in applying the law related to the"
"confiscation of property under the Act is to ensure that legislative intention"
"is not undermined, which in its essence sought stringent legal measures"
"to  safeguard  forests  and  the  environment  at  large,  whilst  safeguarding"
"individual rights."
"Based on the above reasoning, it is the considered view of this Court that"
"the appellant has conducted himself as a reasonable man in satisfying this"
"Court that he had taken all precautionary measures to prevent the use of"
"his vehicle  for  the  commission of  an offence under the Act.  Order dated"
"02.11.2017  of  High  Court  of  Kuliyapitiya  dated  02.11.2017  and  order"
"dated 15.09.2016 of Magistrate’s Court of Kuliyapitiya on 15.09.2016 are"
"hereby  set  aside  and  this  Court  orders  the  vehicle  be  released  to  the"
"appellant and the bond be discharged."
"Appeal allowed."
