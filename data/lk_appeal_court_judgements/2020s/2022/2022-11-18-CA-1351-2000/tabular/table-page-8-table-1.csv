"The learned Judge's Judgment had answered contest No.1 in the affirmative, which deals with the"
"identification but nowhere in the Judgment had he discussed the evidence, documentary or oral"
"and explained how he came to identify the land. Until the land is identified, devolution of shares"
"or exclusion of land cannot be considered."
"The primary duty of the Judge is to identify the land to be partitioned clearly, and he must express"
"his opinion with a proper evaluation. In the present case, there is no indication of how the learned"
"Judge identified the land. When he had not correctly identified the land, he cannot conclude the"
"claims of the 3rd or 17th (a) Defendant-Appellants."
"For reasons set above, we allow the Appeal of the 3rd and 17th (a) Defendant-Appellants and set"
"aside  the  Judgment  of  Additional  District  Judge  of  Gampaha  entered  in  case  No.27222/P  on"
"24.11.2000."
"No order of cost is made. We direct the Registrar of this Court to communicate this Judgment to"
"the District Judge of Gampaha."
