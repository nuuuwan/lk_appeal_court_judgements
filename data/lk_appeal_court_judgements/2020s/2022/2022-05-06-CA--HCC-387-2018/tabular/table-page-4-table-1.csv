"the  deceased  who  was  present  at  the  police  station  pointed  him  to  the  police  officers."
"Thereafter,  the  police  officers  questioned  him  about  the  incident.  As  a  result,  he  had  to"
"divulge the actual incident to the police."
"The  statement  of  this  witness  is  belated.  But  he  gives  a  clear,  justifiable  and  reasonable"
"explanation for the delay in stating the police. It is in fact, a coincidence that the police were"
"able to record a statement from this witness. It is human nature that a person will not come"
"forward to state in respect of a crime. He was not interested and he was a person who could"
"be  much  reluctant  to  get  involved  in  a  legal  process.  The  defence  in  cross-examination"
"challenged the credibility of the said witness."
"The defence suggested that the witness in his statement had never mentioned whether the"
"accused had told him ""පිහියෙන් ඇනල මැරුවා"". But the witness consistently had maintained"
"that the accused had told him the exact way the deceased was murdered. The fact remains"
"that the accused confessed to these witnesses that he murdered the deceased. During the"
"trial,  the  knife  recovered,  based  on the  statement  given  by the  accused  to the police  was"
"shown to the witness. He could not identify the said knife as belonging to the accused. When"
"testifying he had said that he had seen the accused person always carrying a knife attached"
"to his waist."
"He had further said that he had a close relationship with the accused. His son had attended"
"the  wedding  of the  accused’s  son  as  a  page  boy.  To prove  the  said fact, he had  marked a"
"photograph of the wedding as P 2 at the trial. The witness had also stated that his elder sister's"
"daughter previously had a love affair with the accused. According to his evidence, the accused"
"had confessed to him about the murder in a firm voice."
"The evidence of PW 2 and PW 4 strongly corroborate the fact that the accused was present"
"in the vicinity. The deceased's body with 14 stab injuries was recovered 300 meters to 350"
"meters away from the house of the almsgiving. The houses of the accused and the deceased"
"were situated nearby."
"The  learned  Senior  Deputy  Solicitor  General  for  the  respondent  argued  that  there  was"
"absolutely  no  reason  for  PW4  to  wrongly  or  maliciously  implicate  the  culpability  of  the"
"accused.  Hence,  he  further  stated  that  the  confession  made  by  the  accused  to  PW  4  was"
"evaluated by the learned trial Judge according to the provisions of law. The chief investigating"
"officer (PW 7) recovered a knife based on the statement given by the accused-appellant. He"
"had made observations at the crime scene."
"District  Medical  Officer  Dr.  Hewapathirana  (PW  5)  had  conducted  the  post  mortem.  He"
"observed fourteen stab injuries on the deceased's body. He opined that the death was caused"
"due to the injuries inflicted on the neck and chest regions and excessive loss of blood."
"The accused, in his dock statement has denied any involvement but has not challenged the"
"evidence of PW 4."
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  stated  that  the  learned  trial  Judge  having  duly"
"considered the evidence led before him had come to a correct legal finding. He had given"
"reasons for his Judgement as stipulated in section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act."
