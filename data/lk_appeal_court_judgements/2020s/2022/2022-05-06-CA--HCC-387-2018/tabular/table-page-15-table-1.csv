"predecessors of the new Judge who had taken over the trial. However, after concluding the"
"evidence of PW 9 and PW 7 investigation officers, the learned trial Judge had adopted the"
"evidence. Therefore, provisions of section 48 of the Judicature Act  had not been complied"
"with when the evidence of PW 9 and PW 7 were led in the present case."
"The proviso to section 48 is specifically for criminal trials and it was enacted to ensure a fair"
"trial for the accused. According to section 48 of the Judicature Act, the accused must be given"
"an opportunity either to consent to adopt the proceedings and continue with the trial or to"
"make an application to start the trial de novo when a successor of the previous trial Judge was"
"appointed to hear the trial. Therefore, it is intensely relevant to note that the learned high"
"court Judge must follow the 'Cardinal Rule' of affording a fair trial to the accused."
"Basnayake Mudiyanselage Gunaratne vs The Attorney General - CA HC 36-37/2016, decided"
"on 26.06.2018 has specifically explained how the non-compliance of section 48 would violate"
"the right to a fair trial of an accused."
"""On  a  plain  reading,  section  48  makes  transitional  provisions  from  one  Judge  to"

"The non-compliance with section 48 of the Judicature Act is a failure of justice. Section 48 is"
"not a mechanical process and therefore, one cannot avoid the instances of non-adoption of"
"section 48 since it is a statutory right of an accused. The right to a fair trial is a fundamental"
"right guaranteed under the Constitution of our country and apart from the Constitution of Sri"
