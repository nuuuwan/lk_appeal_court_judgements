"therefore, steps had been taken by the Divisional Secretary of Hanwella to recover the"
"possession  of 
it  under 
the  Government  Quarters  (Recovery  of  Possession)  Act."
"According to the learned State Counsel, the reasons for not sending the personal file of"
"the Petitioner to the Pensions Department are the failure of the Petitioner to handover"
"the vacant possession of the quarter and as long as the Petitioner is in possession of the"
"quarter, it is impossible to calculate the arrears and payments which the Petitioner is"
"liable to pay in respect of the quarter to the State to recover the same from the Petitioner."
"The learned State Counsel appearing for the Respondents argued that the Petitioner is"
"well aware that it is a government quarter, which is reserved for the use of the police"
"officers attached to the  Avissawlla police station but  the Petitioner  has  intentionally"
"suppressed and misrepresented those facts. Therefore, the learned State Counsel argued"
"that  on 
the  ground  of  suppression  and  misrepresentation  of  material  facts, 
this"
"Application should be dismissed."
