"When  considering  all  the  above  stated  facts  and  circumstances,  the  Court  can  be"
"satisfied  that  the  Petitioner  is  occupying  a  government  quarter,  which  is  under  the"
"control  of  the  Divisional  Secretary  and  reserved  for  the  use  of  the  police  officers"
"attached to the Avissawella Police Station. It has been reserved for the Petitioner when"
"he  was  serving  in  the  Avissawella  Police  Station  and  even  though,  he  had  been"
"transferred  out  from  the  Avissawlla  Police  Station,  he  had  not  vacated  the  quarter."
"Therefore, the HQI Avissawella had requested from the Divisional Secretary to take"
"steps to recover the possession of the quarter. For the reason that the Petitioner has not"
"handed over the vacant possession of the quarter, in terms of rules and regulations of"
"the Police Department, the Respondents had not sent the personal file of the Petitioner"
"to  the  Pensions  Department.  The  facts  stated  above  are  the  material  facts  to  this"
"Application of the Petitioner. But he had suppressed and misrepresented those facts."
"It is established law that discretionary relief will be refused by Court without going into"
"the merits, if there has been suppression and/or misrepresentation of material facts. It"
"is relevant to refer to the following portion of the judgment of Justice Pathirana in W."
"S. Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi1,"
