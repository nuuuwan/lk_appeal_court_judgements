"2.  Mabey & Johnson Ltd, UK as the principal and the Appellant as the Agent"
"entered  into  an  Agency  Contract  and  the  Appellant  agreed  to  provide"
"services to the said Mabey & Johnson Ltd, UK. There is nothing to show"
"that  the  Appellant  agreed  or  provided  any  service  to  the  local  branch"
"office of the said Company;"
"3.  The  very  existence  of  a  branch  office  in  Sri  Lanka  cannot 
ipso  facto"
"constitute  a  permanent  establishment  and  disentitle  the  Appellant  to  the"
"tax  exemption  unless  the  services  were  provided  to  the  local  branch"
"office;"
"4.  The  TAC  wrongly  disallowed  the  exemption  on  the  basis  that  Mabey  &"
"Johnson  Ltd  is  not  a  person  completely  outside  Sri  Lanka  and  read  into"
"section  13 
(dddd)  words  which  were  not 
there.  The  TAC 
failed 
to"
"conclude  that  the  said  Company  was  not  a  person  outside  Sri  Lanka,"
"instead,  it  came  to  the  conclusion  that  it  was  not  completely  outside  Sri"
"Lanka;"
"5.  The  Appellant’s  documentary  evidence,  including  the  contracts,  invoices"
"and 
the  documents  produced  during 
the  assessment  process  clearly"
"established that the Appellant provided services to Mabey & Johnson Ltd,"
"UK  and  other 
foreign  companies  outside  Sri  Lanka,  and  received  a"
"commission income in foreign currency, which was remitted  to Sri Lanka"
"through a bank."
"[15]  Mr.  de  Silva  referred 
to 
the  decision  of 
the  Court  of  Appeal 
in  The"
"Commissioner-General  of  Inland  Revenue  v.  Aitken  Spence  Travels  Limited"
"CA  Tax/04/2016  decided  on  13.11.2018 
in  support  of  contention 
that 
the"
"phrase  “person  outside  Sri  Lanka” means  a  person  who  is  physically  outside"
"Sri  Lanka.  Mr.  de  Silvasubmitted  therefore,  that  the  Appellant  who  provided"
"services to Mabey & Johnson Ltd, UK and other companies outside Sri Lanka"
"is entitled to the tax exemption in section 13 (dddd) of the Inland Revenue Act."
"[16] On the other hand, Mr. S. Balapatabendhi, the learned Additional Solicitor"
"General who appeared for the Respondent submitted that the TAC was correct"
"in holding that the Appellant is not entitled to the tax exemption in section 13"
"(dddd) of the Inland Revenue Act for the following reasons:"
"1.  Mabey & Johnson Ltd is incorporated in the UK and has a registered place"
"of  business  within  Sri  Lanka  as  it  is  apparent  from  the  form  35  issued"
"under  section  491  of  the  Companies  Act,  No.  07  of  2007  and  therefore,"
"being 
an 
overseas 
company 
in  Sri 
Lanka, 
it 
has 
a 
permanent"
"establishment in Sri Lanka;"
