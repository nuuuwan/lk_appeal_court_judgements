"under section 11, the Act has not made provision for one Commission member ""acting alone"""
"to give such a direction. Therefore, to constitute a valid direction, the said direction must be"
"issued by all three members of the Commission."
"It  must  be  noted  that  prosecutions  can  be  instituted  by  Director  General  with  a  written"
"sanction of the commission. ""Commission"" is not defined as an independent decision, as it"
"comprises of 3 members."
