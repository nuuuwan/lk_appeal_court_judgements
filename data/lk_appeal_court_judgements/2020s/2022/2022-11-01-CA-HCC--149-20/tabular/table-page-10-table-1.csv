"On perusal of the above judgment, it is evident that even in a case the absence of a"
"member does not make the Commission ineffective and therefore the objection raised"
"by the defence should be dismissed."
"Learned counsel for the respondent invited the attention of this court to the effect of the 19th"
"Amendment to the Constitution"
"The 
investigation  of  this 
indictment  was  conducted  when  the  19th  Amendment  to  the"
"Constitution was in force.  Article 156 A, which provided for the Commission to Investigate"
"Allegations  of  Bribery  or  Corruption  reads  thus;  Parliament  shall  by  law  provide  for  the"
"establishment of a Commission to investigate allegations of bribery or corruption. Such law"
"shall provide for the appointment of the members of the Commission by the President on the"
"recommendation of the Constitutional Council;"
" 
The  powers  of  the  Commission, 
including  the  power  to  direct  the  holding  of  a"
"preliminary inquiry or the making of an Investigation into an allegation of bribery or"
"corruption,  whether  of  its  motion  or  on  a  complaint  made  to  it,  and  the  power  to"
"institute  prosecutions  for  offences  under  the

in  force  relating  to  bribery  or"
"corruption;"

"Until  Parliament  so  provides,  the  Commission  to 
investigate  Allegations  of  Bribery  or"
"Corruption Act, No. 19 of 1994 shall apply, subject to the modification that it shall be lawful"
"for the Commission appointed under that Act, to inquire into, or investigate, an allegation of"
"bribery or corruption, whether on its motion or a written complaint made to it."
"The  supreme 
law  of  the  country  at  the  time  of  the 
investigation  and 
Institutions  of"
"proceedings has recognized that 'making of an investigation into an allegation of bribery or"
"corruption, whether of its motion or on a complaint made to it and the power to institute"
"prosecutions for offences under the law in force relating to bribery or corruption are a power"
"of the Commission. Article 156 A (2) of the Constitution has provided that the CIABOC Act of"
"19 of 1994 shall apply on this behalf."
"Having analysed Section 2(8), 3 and 5 of the Commission Act No 19 of 1994, the Supreme"
"Court  held  in the  Anoma  Polwatte  case  that  'When  looking  at  the  provisions of  the  above"
"three provisions of the Act it is clear that by the above provisions, a clear distinction had been"
"made between the powers of the Commission and functions of the Commission. As identified"
"in  section  3  referred  to  above,  when  an  offence 
is  disclosed  after  an 
Investigation,"
"Commission  shall  direct 
the 
institution  of  proceedings  and 
the  said  conduct  of 
the"
"Commission had been identified within the Functions of the Commission. The powers of the"
"Commission have been identified under, section 5 of the Act and under section 2 (8), such"
"powers of the Commission may exercise by its members either sitting together or separately."
