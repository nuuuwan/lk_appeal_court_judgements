"In the backdrop of the above legal principles enunciated by the Constitution and the Apex"

"conducting  an  investigation  into  alike  allegation  is  a  power  of  the  commission  and  not  a"

"of the CIABOC Act 19 of 1994 subject to the modifications of Article 156 A of the Constitution."

"it is sufficient to have a directive even of one commissioner to conduct an investigation since"
"the investigation is recognized as a power of the Commission by the 19th Amendment.  If a"
"necessity arises the Respondent is ready to submit the said directive of the Commission for"
"the perusal of this court."
"In  the premise  of the  above  legal principles,  the  Respondent  submits that the preliminary"
"objection of the Appellant is not tenable."
"The requirement contained in section 11 of Act No. 19 of 1994 is a prerequisite condition for"

"the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law, No. 1 of 1975."
"Section 11 of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act, No. 19"
"of 1994 reads as follows;"
"Section 11"
