"within the plenary jurisdiction of the court, if no objection is taken, the court will then have"
"jurisdiction to proceed and make a valid order."
"In the present case, the objection to jurisdiction was raised for the first time when the matter"
"was being argued in the Court of Appeal and the learned counsel for the respondent says that"
"the objection had not even been taken in the petition filed before this court."
"In  Attapattu  v.  Punchi  Banda  40  NLR  169  It  was  held  that  the  Magistrate  was  right  in"
"proceeding  to  determine  the  case  as  the  objection  had  been  taken  at  a  time  when  the"
"irregularly could not have been cured."
"Learned counsel for the respondents submitted further that the Legal objection was not taken"
"up at the proper forum. To challenge a criminal investigation conducted by the Commission"
"to  Investigate  Allegations  of  Bribery  or  Corruption,  the  accused  person  should  invoke  the"
"jurisdiction of the Supreme Court by way of a Writ Application in terms of section 24 of the"
"Bribery  Commission  Act No  19  of  1994,  a  remedy that  had  been  available for  the  accused"
"since 2015. Therefore, the learned Deputy Solicitor General argued that this is not the forum"
"to decide upon the legality of a criminal investigation conducted by a law enforcement agency"
"like the Commission to Investigation Allegations of Bribery or Corruption."
"Section 24 of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Act"

"Constitution  shall,  in  respect  of  applications  in  which  relief  is  sought  against  the"
"commission be exercised by the Supreme Court and not by the Court of Appeal"""
"Learned counsel for the respondent cited a recent judgement, Director General of CIABOC Vs."
"Lalith Kumara LTA /06/2016 Decided on 23.02.2022, where it was held that the validity of the"
"direction  given  by  the  Bribery  Commission  to  institute  proceedings  in  the  relevant  court"
"cannot be challenged in the Court of Appeal as section 24 of the CIABOC Act provides that"
"any relief against the Bribery Commission should be sought by way of a Writ Application, file"
"in the Supreme Court."
"The respondent has denied part 02 of the preliminary grounds of appeal. It was stated in the"
"petition of appeal and written submission filed by the accused-appellant as follows;"
"""Despite the Supreme Court ruling in the case of Anoma Polwatta v others SC Writ 01"
"/2011 (supra) that it is illegal to initiate an investigation without the direction of all"
"three members of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption,"

"Learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  submitted  that  this  contention  of  the  accused  person  is"
"completely  erroneous  and  the  statutory  law  does  not  support  the  version  of  the  accused"
