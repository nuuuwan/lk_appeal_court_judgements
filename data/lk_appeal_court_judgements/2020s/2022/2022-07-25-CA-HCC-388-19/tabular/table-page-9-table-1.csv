"of lack of consent. The lack of consent has been corroborated by the"
"doctor's expert opinion. The appellant did not raise the defence of lack"

"fail. For these reasons, and for the reasons stated in the Judgment of"
"the learned High Court Judge, I hold that the conviction is correct in"
"law."
