"debt  may  be  taken  in  some  cases  by  the  creditors,  in  order  to  compel  the"
"debtors  to  pay  the  debt  or  discourage  its  debtors  from  committing  similar"
"defaults. The decision to take legal action depends on whether the anticipated"
"costs of litigation or whether the debtors have assets to be recovered or the"
"debtors died without leaving any assets or estate, from which the debt can be"
"recovered, or the debtors have become bankrupt or in liquidation."
"[

"not a requirement before a deduction for a bad debt is claimed provided that"
"the  sufficient  other  information  referred  to  above  is  provided  to  show,  that"
"reasonable steps based on sound commercial considerations were taken by the"
"taxpayer to recover the debt.  In my opinion, it is not possible to contend that"
"bad  debts  cannot  be  deducted  at  all  in  every  case,  until  the  legal  action  has"
"been  taken  or  such  action  has  failed  or  the  asset  is  seized  where  sufficient"
"information has been provided to show that reasonable steps based on sound"
"commercial considerations were taken to recover the debt."
