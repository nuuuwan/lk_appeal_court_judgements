"On perusal  of the  case record,  the learned High  Court Judge  concluded that  the Appellant  had"
"failed to show cause by filling documents or submissions. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge"
"had found no reason to disturb the learned Magistrate's order dated 24.07.2009.he had emphasised"
"that it was the duty of the Appellant to file all original documents or certified copies when applying"
"for the revisionary jurisdiction."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  considered  that  the  Magistrate's  order  was  pronounced  on"
"24.07.2009 when the Appellant moved in revision to the High Court court filing papers to set aside"
"the  order  made  in  her  absence,  which  was  rejected  on  07.08.2009.  The  second  order,  which"
"confirms the demolition order on 24.07.2009, was not canvassed at the High Court."
"According to the learned High Court Judge, even in the petition for revision, the Appellant had"
"mentioned an Affidavit  which is  not part  and parcel  of the  papers petitioners filed at the High"
"Court, which is non-compliance within the meaning of Rule 3(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate"
"Procedure)  Rules  1990.  Dissatisfied  by  the  judgment  delivered  on  30.10.2012,  the  Appellant"
"lodged Appeal papers at the Court of Appeal."
"The main question in this Court is to consider the judgment of the learned High Court Judge. The"
"Appellant must satisfy this Court that the reasoning of the learned High Court Judge is wrong or"
"that she had filed all necessary papers, which the learned Judge overlooked."
"However, having that to the last Appellant took up the position that summons was not served on"
"her by the learned Magistrate. According to the Magistrate's Court case record, the summons was"
"issued over eleven months. Then, by substituted service. She should have urged this matter at the"
"Magistrate's Court."
"A position not taken up at the Magistrate's Court or the High Court cannot now be taken up even"
"though a high emphasis was made that the learned Magistrate had to follow Section 3(a) of Act"
"No.44  of  1984.  An  application  that  should  have  been  taken  before  the  Magistrate  at  the  first"
"Instance available if not taken is estopped by making the application now."
