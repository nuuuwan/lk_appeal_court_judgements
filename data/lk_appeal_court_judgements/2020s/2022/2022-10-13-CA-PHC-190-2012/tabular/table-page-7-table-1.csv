"by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  if  papers  were  filed  according  to  the  stipulated  appellate"
"procedure."
"It was the duty of the Appellant to be vigilant regarding his case. There are many lapses on the"
"part of the Appellant. When she knew she had a final date to file objections, she had not even taken"
"care to get the service of a lawyer, which made the learned Magistrate come to a conclusion on"
"07.08.2009. She had not paid due diligence when filling the revision papers at the High Court."
"Now  in  this  Court,  she  points  out  the  illegality  of  the  Intervenient  parties'  intervention.  An"
"objection should have been made on the day intervention was allowed. Time has now passed to"
"make that application. She fails to show how the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of"
"Ratnapura  dated  30.10.2012  is  not  according  to  Rule  3(1)  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  (Appellate"
"Procedure) Rules of 1990."
"It is accepted that our courts will not help those who sleep upon their rights."
"I see no reasons to disturb the judgment delivered on 30.10.2012. The Appeal is dismissed. No"
"order for costs is made."
