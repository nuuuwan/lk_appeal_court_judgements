"first schedule of the VAT Act, which is applicable to the taxable period"
"commencing  on  or  after  1st  January  2004  has  been  introduced  by  VAT"
"(Amendment) Act No. 15 of 2008. Therefore, the VAT Guide cannot be"
"valid for the amended item (b) (xxiii) of Part II of the First Schedule."
"Yet,  the  phrase  unprocessed  agricultural  products  had  been  there  even"
"before the amendment (in the aforesaid item (i) (a) of Part I of the First"
"Schedule). Therefore, one may argue that the VAT Guide is still valid in"
"interpreting this term. Be that as it may, this Court is not bound to follow"
"the guidelines issued by the Department of Inland Revenue unless those"
"are given statutory force through a specific provision in the VAT Act."
"In D. M. S. Fernando and Another v. Mohideen Ismail,14 Samarakoon C.J.,"
"citing Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edition p.160) stated that:"
"“Then again it is said that to discover the intention of the Legislature it is"
"necessary to consider (1) the law as it stood before the Statute was passed,"
"(2) the mischief if any under the old law which the Statute sought to remedy"
"and (3) The remedy itself.”"
