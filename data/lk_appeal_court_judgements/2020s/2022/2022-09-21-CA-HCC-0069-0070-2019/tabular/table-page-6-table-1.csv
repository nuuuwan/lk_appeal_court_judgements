learned  High  Court  Judge  has  come  to  the"
"above  conclusion  on  the  assumption  that,  both  the"
"appellants  were  apprehended  by  the  crowd  when"
"they  were acting together.  None  of  the  persons  who"
"apprehended  the  appellants  have  given  evidence."
"The  only  evidence  in  that  regard  is  that  the  two"
"suspects were brought to the scene by the crowd of"
"persons.  In  their  evidence  at  the  trial,  witnesses"
"PW1  and  PW3  have  failed  to 
identify  any  of  the"
"appellants  to  be  those  who  were 
involved 
in  the"
"robbery.  However,  the  PW2  has  identified  only  the"
"1st appellant to be a person who was involved in the"
"robbery at the police station. (Page 223 of the brief)."
