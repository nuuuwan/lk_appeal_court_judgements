"the meaning of ""forthwith"" has been discussed and the following passage therein, in my"
"view, is very much pertinent;"
"""The question is substantially one of fact. It is impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule"
"as to what is the meaning of the word 'immediately', in all cases. The words 'forthwith' and"
"'immediately'  have  the  same meaning.  They  are  stronger  than  the  expression  'within  a"
"reasonable time', and imply prompt, vigorous action, without any delay, and whether there"
"has been such action is question of fact, having regard to the circumstances of the particular"
"case""."
