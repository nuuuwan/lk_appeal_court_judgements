"Conclusion."
"For  these  reasons,  I  hold  that  the  impugned  decision  (‘P5’)  of  the  3rd  Respondent  to"
"interdict  the  Petitioner  is  not  eminently  irrational  or  unreasonable  or  is  guilty  of  an"
"illegality. As to the impugned charge sheet (‘P10a’), the Petitioner has failed to submit a"
"viable ground for review. It is ex-facie not apparent on the application of the Petitioner"
"that the Respondents who made the decision to interdict the Petitioner and to issue the"
"charge sheet have acted ultra vires or acted contrary to the rules of Natural Justice or have"
"not complied with mandatory provisions of law."
"In the circumstances, I am of the view that the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs"
"prayed for in the prayer of the Petition."
"Application is dismissed. I order no costs."
