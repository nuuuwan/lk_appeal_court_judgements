"ground. She had not seen anything else. Hence it is incorrect to say that the"
"evidence of the eye witness had been contradicted by the evidence of PW1."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge 
in  his 
judgement  had  considered  the"
"probability factors of this case very extensively. Further, he had analysed the"
"eye witnessâ€™s evidence in its correct perspective and correctly believed and"
"satisfied his evidence to come to his decision."
"The Learned Counsel for the Appellant also argued that the Learned Judge"
"was  deprived  of  observing  the  demeanour  and  deportment  of  the  sole  eye"
"witness."
"It 
is  correct  that  the  evidence  of  the  eye  witness  was 
led  before  his"
"predecessor of the learned judge who wrote the judgment. The Learned High"
"Court Judge who wrote the judgment had properly adopted the evidence led"
"up to that point with the consent of both parties on 08/02/2016.There had"
"been no application by the defence to re-call PW2 in terms of Section 48 of"
"the  Judicature  Act.  Once  the  proceedings  are  adopted  and  continued,  the"
"deprivation of observing the demeanour and deportment cannot be taken as"
"an appeal ground. Further, the Learned Trial Judge who wrote the judgment"
"had very correctly considered the evidence of eye witness with utmost care"
"and caution. He had reasoned for the acceptance of his evidence as reliable"
"and  trustworthy.  Hence,  even  though  the  Learned  Judge  who  wrote  the"
"judgment  did  not  have 
the  benefit  of  observing 
the  demeanour  and"
"deportment  of  the  eye  witness,  he  had  very  extensively  considered  his"
"evidence without causing any prejudice to the Appellant."
"Finally, 
the  Counsel 
for 
the  Appellant  had 
contended 
that  as 
the"
"identification  parade  was  held  after  nearly  a  month  from  the  date  of  the"
"incident and no specific feature of the accused being mentioned by the eye"
"witness, 
the  acceptance  of 
the 
identification  parade  notes  creates  a"
"reasonable doubt about the identity of the Appellant."
