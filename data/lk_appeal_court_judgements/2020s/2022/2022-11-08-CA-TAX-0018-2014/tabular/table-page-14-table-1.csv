"","[39] The next question is to decide, whether from the facts and circumstances",""
"","of the case,  the Appellant can be treated as the manufacturer of the products",""
"","in  question  within  the  meaning  of  section  3(1)(a)  of  the  VAT  Act,  No.  14  of",""
"","2002.  At the hearing  Dr. Kanag-Isvaran submitted that in terms of section 3",""
"","of the VAT Act,  the wholesale and retail supply of goods is exempted from the",""
"","VAT  unless  the  said  wholesale  or  retail  supply  of  goods  is  carried  out  by  a",""
"","manufacturer  or  importer  of  such  goods  sold  by  the  retailer  or  wholesale",""
"","supplier.  Dr. Kanag-Isvaran further submitted that section 83 of the VAT Act",""
"","defines  the  term  “manufacture”,  and  in  terms  of  the  definition,  it  must  be",""
"established  by 
the  Respondent","that 
the  Appellant 
is  engaged 
in","the"
"","manufacturing activity of making of an article. His contention was such activity",""
"","shall  relate  to  the  assembling  or  joining  of  an  article  by  whatever  process",""
"","adapting for sale any article, packaging, bottling, putting into boxes, cutting,",""
"","cleaning, polishing, labelling or in any other way preparing an article for sale",""

"","[40] Dr. Kanag-Isvaran submitted that no part of the agreement entered into",""
"between  RMCC/PSL  with","the  Appellant 
indicates 
that 
the  Appellant","is"
"","undertaking  a  manufacturing  function,  and  the  manufacturing  function  is",""
"","undertaken by RMCC and PSL. His submission was that the Appellant has not",""
"","in any way participated or engaged in any of the activities referred to, under",""
"","the definition “manufacture” in section 83 of the VAT Act. He submitted that",""
"","RMCC and PSL who run their own business in their own facilities and purchase",""
"","their raw material and manufactured the products in question with their own",""
"","labour and own expertise. He contended that in the present case, RMCC and",""
"PSL 
are  physically 
engaged 
in","contract  manufacturing 
activities,","and"
"","manufactured products on their own and the Appellant has merely purchased",""
"goods manufactured by contract manufacturers.","",""
"","[41]  Dr.  Kanag-Isvaran’s  submission  was  that  the  Appellant  only  provided",""
"","specifications, moulds and colours or ingredients to be added on, in order to",""
"","differentiate  the  shape  of  the  products  which  are  the  usual  practices  in  any",""
"","field of business. Dr. Kanag-Isvaran however, argued that such practices cannot",""
"be  construed 
to  classify","the  Appellant  as 
the  manufacturer.  He","further"
"","submitted  that  RMCC  and  PSL  are  contract  manufacturers,  and  a  contract",""
"","manufacturer is in law regarded as the manufacturer. His contention was that",""
"in 
the  absence  of  any","statutory  provision,","the  concept  of  a  deemed"
"manufacturer cannot be applied in respect of the supply of goods.","",""
