"face to be intended to govern the relationship between them necessarily falls"
"within  a  particular 
legal  description  or 
labelling  or  categorization  of  a"
"relationship governed by the said written contract."
"[71] The Supreme Court held that: (i)  when deciding on the categorization of"
"a relationship governed by a written agreement, the label or labels which the"
"parties have used to describe their relationship cannot be conclusive and may"
"often be of little weight; (ii) where the agreement which appears on its face to"
"be  intended  to  govern  the  relationship  between  them,  it  is  necessary  to"
"interpret the agreement in order to identify the parties’ respective rights and"
"obligations;  and  (iii)  it  shall  be  done  in  relation  to  its  legal  and  commercial"
"nature  of  the  relationship  unless  it  is  established  that  it  constitutes  a  sham."
"Lord Numberger stated in paragraph 32 as follows:"
"“32.  When  interpreting  an  agreement,  the  court  must  have  regard  to  the"
"words used, to the provisions of the agreement as whole, to the surrounding"
"circumstances 
in  so 
far  as 
they  were  known 
to  both  parties,  and 
to"
"commercial  common  sense.  When  deciding  on  the  categorization  of  a"
"relationship governed by a written agreement, the label or labels which the"
"parties  have  used  to  describe  their  relationship  cannot  be  conclusive,  and"
"may often be of little weight. As Lewison J. said in A1 Lofts Ltd v. Revenue"
"and Customs Commissioners [2010] STC 214, para 40, in a passage cited by"
"Morgan J:"
"“The  court  is  often  called  upon  to  decide  whether  a  written  contract  falls"
"within a particular legal description. In so doing, the court will identify the"
"rights and obligations of the parties as a matter of construction of the written"
"agreement; but it will then go on to consider whether those obligations fall"
"within  the  relevant  legal  description.  Thus,  the  question  may  be  whether"
"those  rights  and  obligations  are  properly  characterized  as  a  licence  or"
"tenancy (as in Street v. Mountford [1985] AC 809); or as a fixed or floating"
"charge  (as  in  Agnew  v. 
IRC  [2001]  2  AC  710),  or  as  a  consumer  hire"
"agreement (as in TRM Copy Centers (UK) Ltd v. Lanwall Services Ltd [2009] 1"
"WLR 1375). In all these cases the starting point is to identify the legal rights"
"and  obligations  of  the  parties  as  a  matter  of  contract  before  going  on  to"
"classify them.”"
"[
72] Prof. C.G. Weeramantry in his Treatise “Law of Contracts, Vol. II, referring"
"to the local cases  states at para 618:"
"“A court of justice in construing a document should have less regard to its"
"letter  than  to 
its  general  sense  and 
intention.  This  rule  constitutes  an"
"important modification of the rule discussed in the preceding section. Thus"
"the  court  will  not  consider  the  mere  name  given  to  a  transaction,  but  will"
