"[124]  In  the  Bombay  High  Court  in  Commissioner  of  Income-Tax  v.  Penwalt"
"India  Ltd,  [TS-5495-HC-1991  (Bombay)  -OJ,  the  manufacturing  process  was"
"carried out under the direct supervision of the assessee, and one Turner Hoare"
"manufactured machinery as per the instructions of the assessee. The Revenue,"
"admitted  that    (i)  it  was  not  necessary  for  a  person  to  be  engaged  in  a"
"manufacturing activity, that he should undertake all manufacturing activities"
"by  himself;  (ii)  it  would  be  enough  if  he  engages  himself  in  part  in  the"
"manufacturing  activity  and  gets  the  rest  of  it  done  through  the  agency  of"
"others. The Revenue, however, contended that no part of the manufacturing"
"activity  was  done  by  the  assessee  as  everything  concerning  was  done  by"
"Turner Hoare."
