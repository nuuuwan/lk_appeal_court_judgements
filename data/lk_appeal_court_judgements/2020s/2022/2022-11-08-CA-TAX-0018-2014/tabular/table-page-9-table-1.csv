"","will operate from the date on which the Appellant submitted to the jurisdiction",""
"","of the Board of Review according to the Appellant, on receipt of the Petition",""
"","of Appeal by the Board or from the date of the oral hearing. Section 140 (10)",""
"","of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 as amended by Section 52 of the",""
"","Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003 contained 2 provisos, and",""
"","the intention as regards time limit is reflected in the second proviso to section",""
"","140 (10), which reads as follows:",""
"","“Provided, however, the Board shall make its determination or express its",""
"opinion  as","the  case  may  be,  within  two  years","from 
the  date  of"
"","commencement of the hearing of such appeal.”",""
"","[23]  The  submission  of  the  Appellant  in  that  case  was  that  the  legislative",""
"","intention was to dispose of both appeals within a total period of four years",""
"","and the time limit of 2 years will begin to operate from the date on which the",""
"","Petition of Appeal is received by the Board of Review, and not from the date",""
"","of the oral hearing. The State argued however that the legislative intention",""
"","by the use of the word “hearing” in section 140(10) of the Inland Revenue Act,",""
"","No.  38  of  2000  means  an  “oral  hearing”  and  no  more”.  His  Lordship",""
"","Gooneratne J. answered this question at pp. 176-177 as follows:",""
"","“It is very unfortunate  that it took almost 6  ½ years or more to  reach its",""
"","conclusion from the date of filing the Petition of Appeal in the Board. But",""
"","the oral hearing commenced on 21.06.2006. This of course is well within the",""
"","time limit and I would go to the extent to state that the Board has been very",""
"","conscious of early disposal of the appeal. The Board cannot be faulted for",""
"","getting the appeal fixed for hearing as stated above, since it is the duty and",""
"","function of the Secretary of the Board to fix a date and time for hearing and",""
"","to notify the parties. If it was the intention of the legislature that hearing",""
"","should be concluded within 2 years from the date of filing the petition or",""
"","that  the  time  period  of  2  years  begins  to  run  from  the  date  of  filing  the",""
"","petition, there could not have been a difficult to make express provision, in",""
"","that regard. I do agree with the view of the State Counsel. Hearing no doubt",""
"","commences from the date of oral hearing. I would as such answer this",""
"","question  in  favour  of  the  Respondent  and  endorse  the  view  of  the",""
"Board  of  Review.","It","is  not  time  barred  as  the  Board  arrived  at  the"
"","determination within 2 years.” [Emphasis added]",""
"","[24]  For  those  reasons,  His  Lordship  Gooneratne  J.  having  considered  the",""
"","question involved (Question No. 2), held with the Respondent on the basis that",""
"","the hearing for the calculation of time limit of 2 years specified in section 140",""
"","(10) commences ‘from the date of the oral hearing’ and ‘not from the date of",""
"","filing of the petition of appeal’. I have no reason to deviate from the view taken",""
