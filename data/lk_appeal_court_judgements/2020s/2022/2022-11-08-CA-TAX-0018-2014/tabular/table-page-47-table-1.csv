"[141] In my view, the Appellant need not own or possess the manufacturing"
"plant or machinery or raw materials, or physically involve in the manufacturing"
"process, before it could be said to be a manufacturer of goods provided that"
"he is a person by whom or under whose direction,  supervision, control and"
"deep and effective involvement in the manufacturing activity, the goods are"
"made. In the Bombay High Court case of CIT v. Neo Pharma (P) Ltd. (1982) 28"
"CTR  (B0m.)  223,  it  was  held  that  it  is  not  necessary  that  the  manufacturing"
"company must manufacture the goods by its own plant and machinery as its"
"own  factory,  if,  in  substance,  the  manufacturing  company  has  employed"
"another  company  for  getting  the  goods  manufactured  by  it  under  its  own"
"supervision and control."
"[142] The Appellant’s exclusive ownership of the finished products is further"
"manifested from the Articles of the two agreements between the Appellant"
"and RMCC/PSL. The agreement between the Appellant and PSL provides that"
"upon the termination of the agreement, PSL shall have no right whatsoever,"
"to keep plastic moulding tools owned by the Appellant, and any finished work"
"in progress at the time of termination shall be handed over to the Appellant"
"(Article 7.3)."
"[
143] In the case of RMCC, the agreement provides that RMCC can own plant"
"and  machinery,  and  dispose  of  them  to  any  person  of  their  choice  (Article"
"10.3).  The  agreement  provides,  however,  that  RMCC  shall  discontinue  the"
"manufacture 
and 
production 
of 
products 
as 
per 
formulations 
and"
"specifications of the Appellant carrying trademarks, wrappers, cld’s, pouches,"
"bags, packaging permitted by the Appellant to be used during the operation"
"of the agreement (Article 10.5). Further, the agreement provides that RMCC"
"shall  hand  over  all  relevant  documents  to  the  Appellant  (Article  10.5).  The"
"agreement further provides that upon termination, RMCC shall sell or hand"
"over all finished products to the Appellant or dispose of products after duly"
"removing  trade  name,  label,  design  or  copyright  used  by  RMCC  on  such"
"products (Article 10.8)."
"[144] In the present case, although the plant and machinery employed for the"
"purpose  of  manufacture  belonged 
to  RMCC  and  PSL  and  services  of"
"employees were also utilized in that process, all obligations of RMCC and PSL"
"under 
the  agreements  were  performed  under 
the  supervision,  control,"
"direction  and  effective  and  deep 
involvement  of 
the  Appellant.  The"
"manufacturing activity was really that of the Appellant and the Appellant as"
