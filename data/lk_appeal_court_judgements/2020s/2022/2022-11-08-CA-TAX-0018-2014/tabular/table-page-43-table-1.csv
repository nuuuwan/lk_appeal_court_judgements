"someone under its supervisory control or direction."
"[128] Although some Indian cases were decided under the Finance Act, 1996,"
"IT Act, 1961 of India and the Sales Act, the fundamental issue that arose in all"
"those cases was whether activity carried out by the assessee was engaged in"
"the  manufacturing  process  or  carrying  on  a  manufacturing  activity,  which"
"resulted in making the goods. The Courts held that the question as to whether"
"the assessee is engaged in the manufacturing process, or not has to be seen"
"in the context of the control exercised by the assessee."
"[129] The mere use of the word “manufacturer” in any of the manufacturing"
