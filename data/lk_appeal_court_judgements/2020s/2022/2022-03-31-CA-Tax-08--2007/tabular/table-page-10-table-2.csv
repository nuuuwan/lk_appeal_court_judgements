"Definition of the term”export”"
"[28]  As  the  VAT  Act  does  not  provide  a  statutory  definition  to  the  term"
"“export”, this Court has to decide what is envisaged by the term “export” for"
"the purpose of Section 7 (1) (a) of the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002.  It has now"
"become necessary to construe the scope of the term “export”  by using its"
"ordinary  or  literal  meanings  in  common  parlance  as  understood  in  its"
"natural  and  grammatic  manner  in  the  context  in  which  it  occurs  for  the"
"application of Section 7 (1) (a)  of the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002 (as amended)."
