"Act 1 of 1969; and (ii)  the moment the accused-respondent landed in Sri"
"Lankan soil with gold, the act of importation was complete,  if he failed to"
"produce  the  requisite  permit  for  possession  of  that  gold.  Accordingly,  it"
"was held that   he has contravened the provisions of Section 21(1)."
"[78]  In  all  three  criminal  cases,  the  accused  was  considered  to  be  an"
"exporter  on  the  basis  that  he  was  himself  involved  physically  importing"
"prohibited goods into a foreign country without a permit in violation of a"
"criminal statute either under the Customs Act or Imports and Exports Act."
"Here, the issue is whether or not the supply of the bunker fuel to a ship"
"that visits a port of Sri Lanka can constitute an export for the purpose of"
"zero rated status under Section 7 (1) (a) of the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002."
"[79] The other argument of the Appellant was that as the consumption of"
"bunker fuel occurs mid-voyage in international waters of another country,"
"the  question  of  Bill  of  Lading  or  Insurance  Contract  does  not  arise  and"

"Appellant was that the mere supply of bunker fuel to a foreign ship and"
"utilization  of such bunker fuel in the  international waters constitutes  an"
"export within the meaning of Section 7 (1) (a) of the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002."
"[80] The charging provision in Section 2 is the prime purpose of the VAT"
"Act, and it shall control the profits and income that  are chargeable with"
"income tax subject to the provisions of the said Act. As noted, the charging"
"Section is not controlled by the measure of tax levied under the provisions"
"of the Imports and Exports (Contriol) Act or the Customs Ordinance. The"
"relevant  statutory  provisions  with  regard  to  levy  of  customs  duties  are"
"found in the Customs Ordinance and the relevant statutory provisions with"
"regard to the charging of VAT are found in the VAT Act."
"[81] The principles of charging VAT and the principles of charging customs"
"duty  are  distinct,  different    and  independent  of  each  other.  The  VAT  is"
"charged on  the  fulfilment  of  the  conditions  specified  in  Section  2  of  the"
"VAT Act, subject to the provisions of the VAT Act and the VAT rates  vary"
"subject to the provisions of the VAT Act. Customs Duty is a tax imposed on"
