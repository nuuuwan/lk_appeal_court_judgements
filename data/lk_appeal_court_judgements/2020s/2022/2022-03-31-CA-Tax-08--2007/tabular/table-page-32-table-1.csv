"bunkering  industry.  So  that  foreign  going  ships  will  visit  the  Ports  of  Sri"
"Lanka and receive bunker fuel for navigation on the high seas in the course"
"of its journey to the next foreign destination Port and such supplies will"
"receive the zero-rated status under Section 7 (1) (a) of the VAT Act."
"[96]  The 
term 
'export' 
in  Section  7 
(1) 
(a)  of 
the  VAT  Act  signifies"
"etymologically 
'to  take  out  of  Sri  Lanka 
into  the  territory  of  another"
"country, and therefore, means to take out of Sri Lanka, goods to a territory"
"of  another  country.  Now  the  term  ""export  ""  for  the  purpose  the  taking"
"bunker fuel out of Sri Lanka means â€œtaking out of Sri Lanka to any  place"
"(destination  point)  in  the  high  seas  outside  the  territorial  waters  of  Sri"
"Lanka. In this sense, any ""place"" beyond the territorial waters of Sri Lanka"
"would be a place outside the country. The test is that the sending of  the"
"bunker fuel out of the country is satisfied when the bunker fuel, which is"
"directly  delivered  to  the  operator  /owner  of  the  foreign  going  vessel  for"
"navigation on the high seas has a foreign destination  point. The resulting"
"position is that the ownership of the bunker fuel will be  transferred to the"
"owner/operator of the vessel by the supplier from a taxable activity and"
"the  vessel  will  use  those  bunker  fuels  for    navigation  on  the  high  seas"
"intended for a foreign destination point out of the Sri Lankan territorial"
"waters  (the next foreign port). In short, to earn the zero rated status, the"
"goods must have a foreign destination point where they can be said to be"
"taken out of Sri Lanka  to constitute an export under Section 7 (1)(a) of the"
"VAT Act."
"[97] At the hearing, the learned Additional Soliciter-General submitted that"
"in order for a transaction to qualify as export, there should be a recipient"
"for such goods in another jurisdiction as an importer and as there was no"
"corresponding importer in another country to physically receive the goods,"
"the transition in the present case does not constitute an export. Bunker"
"fuel supplied to a foreign going vessel for navigation occasions an export"
"and eligible for the zero rated status under Section 7 (1) (a) of the VAT Act"
"if  it  is  delivered  by  the  supplier  directly  to  a  foreign  going  vessel  and"
"received by its owner/operator for navigation on the high seas out of Sri"
"Lanka,  with  evidence  of  a 
foreign  destination  point.  Once 
these"
"requirements are  fully satisfied with the supplier,"
