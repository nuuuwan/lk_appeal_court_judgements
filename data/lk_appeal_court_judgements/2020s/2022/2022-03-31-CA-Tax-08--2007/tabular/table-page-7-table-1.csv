"not  outside  Sri  Lanka.  She 
further  submitted  that 
in  any  event,  the"
"Appellant had no control over the ships’ journeys; and thus, it is manifest"
"that  the  goods  have  remained  within  the  territorial  waters  of  Sri  Lanka,"
"indefinitely."
"[14]  Referring  to  the  test  of  international  sale  of  goods  transaction,  she"
"argued that the Appellant has failed to produce a single document such as"
"a Bill of Lading, Marine Insurance, invoices and letters of credit, and that"
"the  Appellant’s  documents  do  not  support  that  its  transaction  could  be"
"chaterertised  as 
international  sale  of  goods 
transaction.  She  argued,"
"therefore, that the supply of bunker fuel was no export within the meaning"
"of Section 7 (1) (a) of the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002."
"[15] The Board of Review in holding that the bunker fuel supplied by the"
"Appellant to ships travelling from Sri Lanka cannot constitute an export in"
"the  absence  of  a 
foreign  destination,  relied  on 
the 
test  adopted  by"
"Hidayatullah J.  in the Indian Supreme Court case in Burmah-Shell Oil Storage"
"& Distribution Company Ltd v. Commercial Taxing Office and Othes [1961]1SCR"
"902. That was a case relating to the sale and delivery of aviation spirits to"
"Aircrafts  proceeding  abroad  and  belonging  to  several  companies.  The"
"question  arose  was  whether  the  sale  and  delivery  of  aviation  spirits  to"
"Aircrafts constitutes an export."
"[16]  In  Burmah-Shell  Oil  Storage  &  Distribution  Company  Ltd  v.  Commercial"
"Taxing Office and Othes [supra),  the Indian Supreme Court held that in the"
"context and setting in which the expression “export out of the territory of"
"India” occurs in Part XII of the Constitution, it was not sufficient that goods"
"were  merely  moved  out  of  the  territory  of  India,  but  that  it  was  further"
"necessary  that  the  goods  should  be 
intended  to  be  transported  to  a"
"destination  beyond  India,  so  that  aviation  spirit  sold  to  an  aircraft  for"
"enabling it to fly out of the country was not “exported” out of the country."
"Referring  to the word “export”, Hidayatullah J.,   further  stated that (i) the"
"test is that the goods must have  a foreign destination where they can be"
"said to be imported; (ii)  the crucial fact is the sending  of the goods to a"
"foreign destination where they would be received as imports; and (iii) the"
"two notions of export and import, thus, go in pairs.... and as long as it does"
"not  satisfy  this  test,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  sale  was  in  the  course  of"
"export. ..” Under such circumstances, Hidayatulla J. stated at paragraph 37:"
