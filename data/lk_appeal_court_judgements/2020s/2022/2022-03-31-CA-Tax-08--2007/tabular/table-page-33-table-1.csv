"[98] I do not think that given the nature of the goods being the bunker fuel,"
"which is supplied to the operator/owner of the ship for navigation on the"
"high  seas  for  the  next  foreign  destination  point,  the  requirement 
in"
"traditional  export  of  cargo  where  the  goods  are  exported  to  a  specified"
"recipient 
in  another  foreign 
jurisdiction 
is  necessary  to  constitute  an"
"export under Section 7 (1) (a) of the VAT Act. The above-mentioned second"
"illustration  that  goods  put  on  board  a  streamer  bound  for  a  foreign"
"country,  but  jettisoned  can  still  be  said  to  have  been  “exported”,  even"
"though they do not reach their destination vividly explains this proposition"
"in case of bunker fuel which is supplied for navigation. Another illustration"
"is  where goods shipped from Colombo intended for delivery in Bombay"
"proceeded  on  a  voyage, 
leaving  the  Sri  Lankan  territorial  waters,  but"
"developed engine trouble and returned and ran aground in the Sri Lankan"
"territorial waters at Hambantota Port. In this illustration, the ship intended"
"to deliver the goods at Bombay Port (destination point) and moved out of"
"the Sri Lankan territorial waters and the export was  complete  when the"
"goods  were  taken  beyond  the  territorial  waters  of  Sri  Lanka  with  the"
"intention of delivering at Bombay Port. The fact that the ship was brought"
"back  to  Sri  Lanka  did  not  affect  as the goods sold were intended to be"
"taken to that foreign destination point, namely, the Bombay Port."
"[99] I hold that the zero-rated status under Section 7 (1) (a) of the VAT Act"
"in  the  present  case  applies  to  the  bunker  fuel  directly  supplied  to  the"
"operator or owner of the foreign going vessel to be used for navigation on"
"the high seas (out of the territorial waters of Sri Lanka) and intended to a"
"destination point of another country. This finding is limited to this case and"
"it shall  not in any way be construed as  an application to other  goods in"
"respect of which zero rated supply is claimed under the provisions of the"
"VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002."
"[100] How can the Appellant satisfy that that the ship carrying bunker fuel"
"for navigation was taken out of the Sri Lankan territorial waters?  It must"
"be shown that the supply of bunker fuel was delivered to the foreign going"
"ship’s tanks by the Appellant to be used for navigation on the high seas"
"with a foreign destination point of another country."
