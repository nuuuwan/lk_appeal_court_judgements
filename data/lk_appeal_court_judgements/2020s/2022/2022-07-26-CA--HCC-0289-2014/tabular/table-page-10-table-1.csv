.  If  upon  a  consideration  of  the  proved  items  of  circumstantial  evidence  the"
"only  inference  that  can  be  drawn  is  that  the  accused  committed  the  offence,"
"then they can be found guilty."
"In the case Kusumadasa vs State [2011] 1 SriLR  pg 25,Justice Sisira de Abrew"
"held that; “in a case of circumstantial evidence, if an inference of guilt is to be"
"drawn,  such  inference  must  be  the  one  and  only  irresistible  and  inescapable"
"inference.”"
"In  the  instant  case,  as  some  facts  are  compatible  with  the  innocence  of  the"
"appellant and some facts are not consistent with his guilt,the inference that the"
"appellant is guilty cannot be drawn."
"Hence, I hold that the conviction is not safe and cannot allow to stand."
"I therefore,  set aside the conviction and the sentence and acquit the appellant"
"of the charge with which he was convicted."
"The appeal is allowed."
