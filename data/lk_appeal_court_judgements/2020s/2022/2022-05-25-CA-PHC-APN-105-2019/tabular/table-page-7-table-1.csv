"In the case of Sunil Chandra Kumara Vs. Veloo [(2001) 3 SLR 91] it has been held that revision"
"is available even where there is no right of appeal, but not as of a right, and only on the indulgence"
"of Court to remedy a miscarriage of justice."
"S
ince, revision is a discretionary remedy, it is not available as of right. This power that flows from"
"Article 138 is exercised by the Court of Appeal, on application made by a party aggrieved or ex"
"mero motu and this power is available even where there is no right of appeal. The Petitioner in a"
"revision application only seeks the indulgence of Court to remedy a miscarriage of justice. He does"
"not assert it as a right. Revision is available, unless it is restricted by the Constitution or any other"
"Law."
"T
he need for confirming the scope of this exceptional remedy to miscarriage of justice was aptly"
"reasoned in  Dharmaratne  and another  Vs.  Palm Paradise Cabanas  Ltd and  others  [(2003) 3"
"SLR 24] in page 29 by His Lordship Gamini Amarathunga J. after considering several authorities"
"where he expressed the following view:"
"‘The requirement of exceptional circumstances for the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction is not a"
"requirement statutorily laid down anywhere.’"
"A
s Gunawardana J. himself has referred to Abrahams CJ. in Ameen Vs. Rasheed [38 NLR 288]"
"explained the rationale for insisting on the existence of exceptional circumstances for the exercise"
"of revisionary jurisdiction."
"A
ccording to Abrahams CJ, revision of an appealable order is an exceptional proceeding and a"
"person seeking this method of rectification must show why this extra-ordinary method is sought"
"rather than the ordinary method of appeal. As Hutchinson CJ. stated in Perera Vs. Silva [supra],"
"it is not possible to contend that the power ought to be exercised or that the legislature could have"
"intended that it should be exercised so as to give the right of appeal practically in every case."
"T
hus, the existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the Court selects cases"
"in  respect  of  which  this  extra-ordinary  method  of  rectification  should  be  adopted.  If  such  a"
"selection  process  is  not  there,  revisionary  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  will  become  a  gateway  for"
