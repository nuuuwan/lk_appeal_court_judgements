"appellant was still present in the house stating that because of the reputation"
"the appellant had as a Kapu Mahaththaya who can do evil things, she had no"
"courage to do so, but informed of what happened no sooner he left the house."
"She  has  also  admitted  that  she  was  not  a  virgin  at  that  time  because  of  the"
"previous  sexual 
relationship  she  had  with  her  boyfriend.  She  has  also"
"explained 
that  although  she 
felt  dizzy  at 
the 
time,  she  could  see  and"
"understand what the appellant was doing and what happened to her."
"The  stand  of  the  appellant  had  been  that  this  was  a  false  complaint  against"
"him because of the prosecutrix’s failure to pay him his fees for the performance"
"of  the  ritual  which 
led  to  a  verbal  confrontation  with  the  brother  of  the"
"prosecutrix."
"Confirming the position of the prosecutrix the sister-in-law (PW-02) has stated"
"that  no  sooner  the  appellant  left,  she  was  informed  of  what  happened,  but"
"waited till the alms-giving is over to make a complaint to the police. It was her"
"evidence  that  rupees  7500/-  was  paid  to  the  appellant  and  there  was  no"
"dispute  as  to  the  payments  as  alleged,  and  that  there  was  no  reason  for  her"
"sister to fabricate a story against the appellant."
"PW-10 was the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who examined the prosecutrix on"
"30-06-2012 at 4.30 pm. in the teaching hospital Anuradhapura. His report has"
"been  marked  as  P-01  at  the  trial.  When  examining  her  genital  area,  he  has"
"observed  a  fresh  healing  deep  posterior  hymeneal  tear  at  6  O’  clock  position"
"and was of the opinion that it was a result of recent sexual penetration. He was"
"firm  in  his  opinion  that  this  type  of  an  injury  occurs  when  a  female  is  in  a"
"sleeping position facing upwards and a male person inserting a penis from top"
"of her, considering the place of injury to the hymen of the prosecutrix."
"Under  cross  examination,  the  JMO  has  stated  that  in  the  space  where  the"
"short  history  given  by  the  patient  needs  to  be  mentioned  in  P-01,  what  was"
"written was a short summary in his words in English and not the exact words"
"spoken by the prosecutrix."
