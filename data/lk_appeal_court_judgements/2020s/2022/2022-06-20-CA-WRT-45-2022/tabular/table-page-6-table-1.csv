"incuriam. Moreover, as stipulated in the judgement of Gupta Sugar Works vs. State of"
"U.P., AIR 1987 SC 2351, it is important to note that the non-reference of earlier decisions"
"in the judgement does not indicate non-consideration of those cases in the judgement."
"Therefore, it is necessary to examine whether the order made by this Court on 03.02.2022"
"was made carelessly by not taking any terms of a statute into consideration or whether the"
"said  order  does  not  reconcile  with  a  previously  pronounced  judgement  or  any  other"
"relevant law/rule."
"The Petitioner states in his purported ‘Revision Petition’ that the “prerogative writs issued"
"in terms of Article 140 by the Court of Appeal are rights exclusively affecting a person or"
"a class of people who seeks relief under the said Article and therefore, the law does not"
"allow intervention in any manner by a third party in writ application and as a result the"
"order made by this Court is void per incuriam in limine”. As I have mentioned before, no"
"order  has  been  made  by  this  Court  allowing  any  intervention  other  than  allowing  the"
"learned Counsel for the parties who sought to be intervened to make submissions."
"Furthermore, the Petitioner states that this Court has made a flawed reference about the"
"Petitioner’s appearance in the relevant order referring to the Supreme Court Rule 70. It"
"should  be  noted  that  this  Court  has  not  made  any  order  referring  to  the  Petitioner’s"
"appearance other than mentioning in the relevant order, a portion of the submissions made"
"by the learned Counsel (for the parties sought to be intervened) against the Petitioner based"
"on Rule No.70 of the Supreme Court Rules."
"The articulation on per incuriam developed in Young vs. Bristol Aeroplane Co. (1944) 2"
"AH E. R. 293., in my view, is of much relevance to the instant application. The dicta in"
"the  said  case  has  been  followed  even  by  Lord  Evershed  M.  R.  in Morelle, Ltd. vs."
