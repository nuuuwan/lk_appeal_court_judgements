"In M. Gomes Vs. W.V.D Leelaratne 66 NLR 233 it was stated that:"
"“A Judge in determining the proper sentence should first consider the gravity"
"of the offence as  it  appears from  the nature of the  act  itself. Should have"
"regards to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or the Statute under"
"which he is charged.”"
"When the sentence imposed upon the accused by the learned High Court Judge"
"is considered, it needs to be mentioned that for an offence of this nature where"
"the offender has caused serious injuries to the victim, he shall be liable to an"
"imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 20 years and"
"shall also be liable to a fine."
"Given the facts and the circumstances of this case, this Court is of the view that"
"the  term  of  imprisonment  imposed  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  to  the"
"appellants is very much adequate. In imposing the sentence, the Learned High"
"Court Judge has considered the mitigatory circumstances as well as the gravity"
"of the offence. Hence, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the sentence"
"of the learned High Court Judge."
"The appeal against the sentence is dismissed as this Court finds no merit in the"
"appeal. The conviction and the sentence affirmed."
