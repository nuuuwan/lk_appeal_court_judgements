"Act or what action was taken pertaining to the workforce."
"This Court finds the Petitioner has failed to give a sufficient explanation to this question nor has"
"he explained the action of removing the business name with effect from a prior date namely about"
"7 months before the date he actually informed the registrar. However, the Petitioner contended that"
"subsequent  to  their  removing  the  business  name,  Jayalath  Padmalal  had  taken  over  part  of  the"
