"However, the Petitioners contended that the  Petitioner being a partner, should have been  issued"
"with a separate notice. The said contention is based on the premise that under the Partnership Law"
"of Sri Lanka, if action is instituted against partners, it should be against all partners. To substantiate"
"this submission, he has extensively relied on the  judgment of this Court in Oretra Enterprises"
"and others v Wijekoon (2003) 3 SLR  page 1 where the court held, under the  Civil Procedure"
"Code, if action is instituted against the partnership all partners should be made parties to the case."
"Therefore, it was his argument that the whole inquiry that resulted in the determination P9 should"
"be annulled for violation of rules of natural justice as far as the 2nd Petitioner is concerned, as he"
"had not been sufficiently notified."
