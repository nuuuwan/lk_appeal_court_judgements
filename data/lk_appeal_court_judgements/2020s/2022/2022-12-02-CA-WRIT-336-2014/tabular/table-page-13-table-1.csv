"The  impugned  order  P9  has  been  signed  by  W.  L.  J.  U  Wijeyweera  Acting  Commissioner  of"
"Labour. The 2nd Petitionerâ€™s position is the said order could be signed only by the Commissioner"
"of Labour which would not include an acting appointment. It is his contention that the Court should"
"not give a wider interpretation to the Commissioner of Labour to include an acting appointment."
"It is also his contention that only the holder of the permanent post is empowered under the Act to"
"sign the order. Considering the relevant section, we find that sections 6 and 6A of the Termination"
"of  Employment  of  Workmen  (Special  Provisions)  Act,  give  the  power to the  Commissioner  to"
"issue orders in instances where the employer terminates the scheduled employment of a workman"
"in contravention of the provisions of this Act."
