"(Special Provisions) Act. Therefore, in our view, the 2nd Petitioner has had sufficient notice of the"
"inquiry pending before the inquirer."
"When we come to this conclusion, we have also considered the fact that the 2nd Petitioner has not"
"submitted to this Court that he was unaware of the happenings in the partnership nor has he said"
"that he was a silent or a sleeping partner and not taken part in administration or investing money"
"in the partnership. In the absence of such, it is safe for this Court to come to the conclusion that"
"the  2nd  Petitioner  was  aware of  the  facts  and  was  aware of  the  inquiry  especially  when  Ruwan"
"Lankan  Garments 
itself  has  nominated  a  representative,  an  attorney-at-law  to  represent  the"
"employer before the inquiring officer."
"It is also pertinent to note that when the registrar of business registration is informed of the removal"
"of the business entityâ€™s name from the register the said removal is informed to both the Petitioners."
"It  is  also  pertinent  to  note  that  the  removal  of  the  business  name  from  the  register  took  place"
"subsequent  to  the  commencement  of  the  inquiry  under 
the  Termination  of  Employment  of"
"Workmen (Special Provisions) Act before the commissioner."
"Therefore, we are unable to agree with the contention of the Petitioner that there was no sufficient"
"notice issued to the 2nd Petitioner pertaining to the inquiry and therefore there is a violation of the"
"rules of natural justice as contemplated under section 17, thereby making the impugned order P9"
"bad in law. Accordingly, the said contention has to fail."
"We have also considered the fact that the Petitioner has failed to submit to this Court whether they"
"had complied with the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act  when"
"the business entity Ruwan Lanka Garments was removed from the registration of Business Names,"
"on  the  request  of  both  the  Petitioners.  The  Petitioners  have  failed  to  submit  to  this  Court  any"
"material to demonstrate as to whether they obtained the permission of the commissioner prior to"
"their actions stated above especially the closure of the business.  The only material that is before"
