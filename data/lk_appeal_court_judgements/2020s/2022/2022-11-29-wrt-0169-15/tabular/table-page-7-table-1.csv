"summary trial and upon its findings, had been severely reprimanded. This incident occurred in the"
"year 2014. In 2014 December, the Petitioner had been issued with a letter stating that his services"
"are no longer required (P4) which is marked as A8, which the Petitioner is seeking to quash by"
"way of a writ of certiorari."
"Does the Petitioner fall in to the category of an airman?"
"The  Petitioner  contended  that  he  being  a  warrant  officer  cannot  fall  under  the  category  of  an"
"airman. However, the Petitioner did not strenuously pursue this contention at the argument stage."
"Nevertheless, this Court will now consider the ground whether the Petitioner falls in the category"
"of  an  airman.   Parties  are  not  at  variance  on the ground that the  Petitioner’s  last  held  post  was"
"Warrant Officer. At the argument stage, the Petitioner contended that a ‘Warrant Officer’ does not"
"fall under the category of an airman. The answer to this can be found in the interpretation section"
"of the Airforce Act. Section 161 of the Act defines an airman as, “airman"" does not include an"
"officer  as  defined  by  this  Act,  but,  subject  to  the  special  provisions  in  this  Act  contained  in"
"relation to warrant officers and non-commissioned officers, does include a warrant officer and"
"a non-commissioned officer…”"
"Also, it is pertinent to note that the Petitioner himself in his amended petition in paragraph 16 has"
"acknowledged that the rank of a warrant officer is categorized as an airman."
"Accordingly, the argument by the Petitioner that he does not fall under the category of an airman"
"has to fail."
"Can the Petitioner be tried in a summary trial?"
"The  Respondents  submitted  the  proceedings  of  the  summary  trial  marked  R3.  As  per  the  said"
"document,  the  Petitioner  has  been  charged  under  section  129(1)  and  the  Respondents  had"
"7"
