"Air  Force  Regulations  depicted  in  Table  B  XIII  of  the  Fifth  Schedule,  do  not  allow  the"
"discharge of a Warrant Officer."
"Petitioner  contends  that  he  being  a  warrant  officer,  cannot  be  subject  to  Table  B  of  the  Fifth"
"Schedule of the Regulations as  it does not permit the discharge of a warrant officer but applies"
"only to an airman. However, this contention was not pursued by the Counsel at the argument. As"
"submitted by the Respondents, it is pertinent to note that item 13A of the Regulations applies to"
"an airman. As held above this Court elsewhere in this judgment has referred to the definition under"
"section  161,  and  held  that  a  Warrant  officer  falls  within  the  definition  of  an  airman.  It  is  also"
"pertinent to note that Regulation item 13B under ‘Special instructions’ stipulates that it applies to"
"an airman other than a warrant officer class 1 with less than 14 years of service. The plain reading"
"of  item  13A  and  13  B  clearly  distinguish  that  even  though  in  item  13B  a  warrant  officer  is"
"excluded, under 13A it is not so. It only refers to an airman as stated earlier which encompasses a"
"warrant officer. Thus, the Petitioner’s argument that he will  not be captured under item 13A of"
"Table B has to fail."
"Now we will consider the objections raised by the Respondents."
"Suppression of material facts"
"It is pertinent to note that the Petitioner subsequent to him being punished for being absent without"
"official leave in the years 1994 and 1997 (R7 and R8) had been issued with a warning letter (R9)."
"The caption to the said letter states as follows, ගුවන් හමුදා ප්‍රමිතීන්ට අනුකූල සනාවන"
"භටසයකුට සදනු ලබන අවවාද and he has been warned as follows,"
"15"
