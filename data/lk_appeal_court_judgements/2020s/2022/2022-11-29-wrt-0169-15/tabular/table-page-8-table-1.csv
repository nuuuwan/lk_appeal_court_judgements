"proceeded with a summary trial under section 40(1)(b) (II) and section 42 of the Air Force Act. It"
"is the contention of the Petitioner, that the Petitioner being a Warrant Officer cannot be charged"
"under  section  42  in  a  summary  trial  and  his  punishment  under  Regulations  13B  of  the  Fifth"
"Schedule, Table B is bad in law as the said Regulation applies only to an airman."
"This Court observes that section 40 (1) empowers the Commanding Officer to investigate a charge"
"and the Commanding officer has the discretion to decide whether the person in custody should be"
"charged by proceeding with a court martial or whether he can be summarily tried. Section 40 (b)"
"(ii) reads as follows,"
"“…….. (b) if he in his discretion decides that the charge should be proceeded with, shall..."
"(ii) where that person is an officer of a rank below that of Wing Commander or is a warrant"
"officer, refer the case to be dealt with summarily by the Commander of the Air Force or by such"
"officer not below the rank of Group Captain as may thereto be authorized by the Commander"
"of the Air Force, or….”"
"The  said  section  in  our  view,  clearly  empowers  the  Commanding  Officer  to  decide  whether  a"
"person  should  stand  trial  at  a  court  martial  or  by  way  of  a  summary  trial  and  the  said  section"
"captures the post of a Warrant Officer. Thus, referring the Petitioner to stand a summary trial is"
"provided for by the Air Force Act. The short title of Section 42 states as follows,"
"“Summary trial of accused who is an officer of a rank below that of Wing Commander or is a"
"warrant officer”."
"Accordingly, we uphold the Respondents submission that the decision to hold a summary trial as"
"well as proceeding with the summary trial against the Petitioner has not violated the provisions of"
"the Air Force Act."
