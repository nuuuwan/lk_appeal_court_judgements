"The Petitioner cannot be discharged under section 129 (1) read with section 42 of the Air"
"Force Act, as for a discharge under the said section, there should be a conviction consequent"
"to a court martial."
"The Petitioner argues that if he was charged under section 42, the punishment that can be meted"
"out is also given in the said section. As per the said punishments, he cannot be discharged from"
"the service. He also contends that he has also been charged under section 129(1). The said section"
"broadly  deals  with  conduct  prejudicial  to  air  force  discipline.  The  first  part  of  the  said  section"
"which describes the offence states as follows,"
"Section 129(1) subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section every person subject to"
"this  act  who,  by  any  act,  conduct,  disorder,  or  neglect,  prejudices  good  order  and  air  force"
"discipline shall be guilty of an air force offence and shall……"
"As submitted by the Respondents, this Court observes that section 42 does not describe an offence,"
"but section 129 (1)  describes the offence. In this  instance, it was submitted that the Petitioner’s"
"offence  is  described  under  section  129  (1).  However,  as  discussed  earlier,  section  42  permits  a"
"Warrant officer to be charged with any offence to be dealt with summarily. It is also pertinent to"
"note as submitted that section 129 (1) does not contemplate of a situation where a person charged"
"under the said section should be necessarily tried by a court martial. It was further submitted that"
"the punishment that can be meted under section 129 is stipulated under section 133."
"It is the contention of the Petitioner that for the Petitioner to be convicted under section 129 (1)"
"and punished, he should  have  been  found guilty  by a court martial. If  he was  found guilty of a"
"court martial then under section 133 (1), depending on the severity of the offence he could have"
"been  dismissed  from  the  air  force  or  meted  out  punishment  as  stipulated  under  section  133."
"However, it is his contention that since he had not been convicted by a court-martial, he cannot be"
"discharged from the air force in pursuance of section 129(1)."
