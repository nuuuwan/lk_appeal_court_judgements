"Police  had  recorded  statements  from  other  inmates  who  were  inside"
"the same cell at that time to substantiate the position."
"Hence the suspect had been in remand ever since and the counsel for"
"the suspect is canvassing bail on the ground of the period in remand as"
"being exceptional."
"According  to  the  provisions  of  the  Act  under  which  the  suspect  been"
"produced, bail can be considered only under section 10 (1) of the said"
"act, on exceptional ground by the Court of Appeal."
"The  term  exceptional  has  not  been  defined  in  the  act  but  it  had  been"
"considered  and  had  been  defined  to  be  that  it  should  be  considered"
"according to the facts of each case by our legal luminaries."
"In the instant matter what has been urged as exceptional is the period"
"in remand."
"But the Counsel appearing for the respondents urged that the nature of"
"the  offence  and  the  manner  in  which  it  had  been  committed  and  the"
"place  of  incident  clearly  demonstrate  the  scant  disregard  the  suspect"
"has had for the judicial system. Therefore the respondents vehemently"
"objected for bail being granted to the suspect."
"The  objective  the  Act  in  the  instant  matter  has  been  well  defined  in"
"section 2(a) of the same which reads as,"
"“Set out to uphold and enforce the rights and entitlements of victims"
"of  crime  and  witnesses  and  to  provide  for  a  mechanism  to  promote,"
"protect, enforce and exercise, such rights and entitlements...”"
