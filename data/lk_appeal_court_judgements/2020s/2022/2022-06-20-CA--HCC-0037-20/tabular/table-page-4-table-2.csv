"(e)  There is a steady increase in the number of sexual offences being committed in Sri"
"Lanka and there is a significant increase in the cases relating to child abuse."
"It was the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent that the Previous conviction"
"report on page 48 of the Appeal brief of the accused-appellant amply demonstrates that the"
"accused-appellant has been imposed suspended sentences on 6 occasions by courts of law"
"and  such  leniency  has  had  no  positive  effect  on  him.  The  previous  conviction  report  also"
"indicates that the accused-appellant qualifies to be imposed long sentences under section 6"
"of the Prevention of Crimes Ordinance."
"The offences relating to this case have been committed during the operative period of one of"
"the suspended terms of imprisonment. The learned counsel for the respondent submits that"
"the callous disregard demonstrated by the accused-appellant to the numerous opportunities"
"given by courts of law to reform himself and reintegrate into society and repetitions of crimes"

"offence  of  Statutory  Rape  has  been  the  prevention  of  sexual  exploitation  of  children  and"
"protection of children. A child of 15 years does not have the mental maturity or perception"
"to give consent to an act of sexual intercourse. The child is not mindful of the gravity of the"
"consequences attendant upon the physical act of intercourse and therefore the criminal law"
"has  protected  that  child  by  declaring  that  the  act  of  intercourse  per  se,  whether  there  is"
"consent or not, constitutes rape."
"The legislature in it its wisdom has also expressly provided that persons below the age of 18"
"years,  who  themselves  fall  within  the  definition  of  ""child""  will  not  attract  the  minimum"
"mandatory sentence if sexual intercourse has been committed with ""consent""."
