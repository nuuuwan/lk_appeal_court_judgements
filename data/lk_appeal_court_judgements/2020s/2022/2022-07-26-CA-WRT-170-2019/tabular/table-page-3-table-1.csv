"plan bearing No. NU/SG/2018/29 made by the Surveyor Superintendent"
"of Nuwara Eliya, to the Respondent before 30-04-2019."
"The Petitioner states that the said Indenture of Lease marked as ‘C’ is still"
"in operation and valid up to 17-06-2045, and has not been terminated at"
"all.  As  such,  the  Respondent  is  not  entitled  in  law  to  interfere  with  the"
"Petitioner’s possession of the said estate or any part thereof so long as the"
"said lease is in operation. The Petitioner pleads that in terms of the said"
"lease agreement the possession of the Petitioner is lawful and justified and"
"thus the Respondent is not entitled to form an opinion that the Petitioner’s"
"possession  of  any  portion  of  Pedro  Estate  is  unlawful  in  terms  of  the"
"provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act."
"In these circumstances, the Petitioner pleads that the said Notice to Quit"
"marked as ‘D’ issued on the basis that the Petitioner is in unauthorized"
"possession of a portion of the said “Pedro Estate” is unreasonable, mala-"
"fide,  unlawful  and  ultra  vires,  and  therefore,  the  same  is  liable  to  be"
"quashed in-limine."
"The Contention of the Respondent."
"The Respondent in his objections moves for a dismissal of the Petitioner’s"
"application on the footing, inter-alia, that,"
