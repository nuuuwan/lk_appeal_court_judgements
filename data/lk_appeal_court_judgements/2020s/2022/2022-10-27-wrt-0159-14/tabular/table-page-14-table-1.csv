"It is common ground that a liquor license is valid for a period of 1 year thus, it has to be extended"
"annually by the respective parties on submitting a fresh application with the required documents"
"as per the Excise Ordinance and the Regulations. Once the said application is received, the 1 st"
"Respondent has to be satisfied with the information submitted, and thereafter if all the criteria"
"necessary for the granting of a license are fulfilled, a license will be issued pertaining to the duly"
"filled application form."
"In our view, the Petitioner is attempting to overcome the said provisions by seeking a court order"
"to obtain the liquor license by way of a writ of mandamus. There is a clear procedure laid down"
"in the Excise Ordinance and the Excise Regulations, which the Petitioner should follow and after"
"that,  if there is  an unjust refusal, only the Petitioner  should consider applying  for a writ of"
"mandamus.  The Petitioner has not satisfied this Court with any material to demonstrate that he"
"has  followed   the  procedure  laid  down  under  the   Excise  Ordinance  and  the   Regulations  and"
"applied   for   a   new   license.   This   Court   is   also   mindful   that   as   per   Regulation   13   (b),   the"
"Commissioner General has the right to be satisfied with ownership, before the issuance of a"
"license and the same Regulations empower the Commissioner General to hold an inquiry in the"
"event of receiving a complaint for violation of the said Regulations. A writ of mandamus is a"
"discretionary  remedy  that the  court  grants. In the absence  of any refusal  or any material  to"
"demonstrate that the Petitioner has made an application to obtain a new license fulfilling the"
"criteria,   and   in   compliance   with   the   provisions   of   the   Excise   Ordinance   as   well   as   the"
"Regulations, this Court is not inclined to use its discretion in favor of the Petitioner."
