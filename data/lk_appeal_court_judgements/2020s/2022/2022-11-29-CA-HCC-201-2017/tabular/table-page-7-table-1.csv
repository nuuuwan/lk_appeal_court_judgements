"knew both accused from childhood. The first and third accused were going on a"
"bicycle  at  that  time.  The  third  accused  was  riding  the  bicycle,  and  the  first"
"accused was sitting on the bicycle. The second accused had asked PW3 to slow"
"down the three-wheeler. When the three-wheeler slowed down near the bicycle,"
"the  second  accused  asked  the  first  accused  to  get  into  the  three-wheeler.  At"
"page 158, PW3 stated as follows:"
"ප්‍ර: 
නීල් චමින්ද කියන  1 කවනි විත්තතිෙරු අකත්ත කමානවා හරි දකින්න තිබුණාද?"
"උ: 
ඒ කවකල් කිසි කදයක්ෂ කපකනන්න  තිබුකන් නැහැ"
"Counsel for the appellant argued that this piece of evidence should have been"
"considered  in  favour  of  the  appellant.  However,  PW3  said  that  when  the  first"
"accused got down from the three-wheeler,  the first accused had a sword, and"
"at  the  same  time,    PW3  categorically  said 
(on  page  154)  that  the  second"
"accused  did  not  have  anything  in  his  possession.  PW3  further  said  that  the"
"first  and  second  accused  ran  after  getting  down  from  the  three-wheeler.  The"
"three-wheeler  was  not  stopped  but  only  slowed  down.  The  evidence  of  PW3"
"does not support the version of the appellant. The evidence of PW3 was that at"
"the time when the second accused got into the three-wheeler at the place of the"
"incident,  he  did  not  have  anything  in  his  possession;  PW3  noticed  that  the"
"appellant (first accused) had a sword in his possession at the time when he got"
"down  from  the  three-wheeler.      The  first  accused  got  into  the  three-wheeler"
"about 400 meters away from the place of the incident."
"The sword was recovered in consequence of the information of the appellant. As"
"per the police evidence, the sword  was  not  in  a place  where it  could be easily"
"recovered if the appellant did not give the information."
"Counsel argued that even though the weapon could be found, it was not proved"
"the connection it had with the first accused. The evidence of PW3 revealed that"
