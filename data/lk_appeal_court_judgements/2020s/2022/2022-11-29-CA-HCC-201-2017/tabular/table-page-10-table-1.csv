"When considering the evidence of the case as a whole, the evidence proves the"
"charge  against  the  appellant  beyond  reasonable  doubt.  Therefore,  I  am  of  the"
"view that any shortcoming in the judgement has not prejudiced the substantial"
"rights of the appellant or occasioned a failure of justice."
"Considering  the  above,  I  see  no  reason  to  disturb  the  conviction  and  the"
"sentence imposed on the appellant."
"For the above-stated reasons, the appeal is dismissed."
