"For the reasons I have stated earlier one can come to the conclusion that the heirs"
"and successors in title of Podina and the heirs and successors in title of Podiya had"
"not acted upon on the compromise effected between Podina and Podiya in court"
"and they have abandoned the settlement by their conduct. They have waived off"
"the terms of settlement by their subsequent conduct. Therefor the learned District"
"Judge had come to a correct conclusion when she answered the issues number 5,"
"6 and 7 in the affirmative in favour of the Plaintiff. The learned District Judge has"
"given to the successors in title of Podiya (5th, 6th,7th, 8th and 9th Defendants) the"
"entire 5/12 share which had been transferred to Podiya by Abanchiya. The learned"
"District Judge had given to the successors in title of Podina the entire 1/8 share"
"which  had  been  transferred  to  Podina  by  Abanchiya.  Both  those  deeds  can  be"
"accommodated  within  the  pedigree  disclosed  by  the  Plaintiff.  The  5th  and  9th"
"Defendants cannot ask the court to prevent Podinaâ€™s successors in title from getting"
"their  undivided  rights  because  of  a  compromise  which  the  parties  and  their"
"successors in tittle had waived off by their conduct. Therefore, the appeal of 5th and"
"9th Defendants must necessarily fail."
