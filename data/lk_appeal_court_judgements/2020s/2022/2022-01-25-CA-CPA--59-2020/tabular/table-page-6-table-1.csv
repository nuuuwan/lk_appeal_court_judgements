"As  such  this  Court  is  unable  to  accept  the  contention  put  forward  by  the"
"learned Counsel for the petitioner that there was no proper charge framed."
"But in view of the documents filed by the petitioner marked as V1 and V2 it"
"is very clear  that the petitioner had been running  a rent a car service and"
"the  said  Sunil  had  rented  out 
the  vehicle 
from  him  and 
in 
the  said"
"agreement  the  petitioner 
  had  added  a  clause  stating  that  the  vehicle"
"should  not  be  used  for  any  illegal  activities  and    just  3  days  prior  to  the"
"expiration of the contract the alleged incident had taken place, therefore  it"
"is the opinion of this Court that the probability of the petitioners knowledge"
"of the alleged incident  is very unlikely because the physical control of the"
"vehicle was not with the petitioner."
"As such according to the provisions of the relevant act before confiscating"
"the tools used in an offence the claimant of the said tools has to be heard"
"and  he  has 
to  prove  on  acceptable 
terms 
to  Court 
that  he  had  no"
"knowledge of the incident."
"In 
the 
instant  matter 
the  knowledge  of 
the  petitioner  has  not  been"
"adequately considered by the learned High Court Judge and the Magistrate."
"As such  the instant application for revision is allowed and the impugned"
"orders of the High Court and the Magistrate Court are hereby set aside."
