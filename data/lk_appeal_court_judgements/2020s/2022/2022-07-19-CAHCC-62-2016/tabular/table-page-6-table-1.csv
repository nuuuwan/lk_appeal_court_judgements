"the  Appellant  on  the  day  of  the  incident  with  the  bright  light  condition."
"Also,  she  had  described  the  physique  of  the  Appellant  when  she  made  a"
"statement to the police."
"PW2  had  vehemently  denied  the  query  posted  by  the  defence  to  the  effect"
"that the Appellant was shown to her at the police station and that she was"
"shown  his  photograph  before 
the 
identification  parade.  The  witness"
"endorsed  the  fact  that  she  had  clearly  identified  the  Appellant  when  he"
"attacked  the  deceased  with  a  long  knife  without  any  contradictions  or"
"omissions."
"At  the  identification  parade  two  persons  had  been  paraded  but  PW2  had"
"properly 
identified  the  Appellant  as  the  perpetrator  of  the  crime.  It 
is"
"pertinent  to  note  that  PW2  had  told  the  police  that  she  could  identify  the"
"person  if  she  sees  him  again.  This  too  proves  that  PW2  had  correctly"
"identified the Appellant at the crime scene."
"The Learned High Court Judge had accurately discussed the circumstances"
"upon  which  PW2  had 
identified  the  Appellant.  She  had  very  correctly"
"disregarded  the  one  and  only  contradiction  marked  on  the  evidence  given"
"by PW2, stating that the said contradiction is not forceful enough create a"
"doubt about the identity of the Appellant."
