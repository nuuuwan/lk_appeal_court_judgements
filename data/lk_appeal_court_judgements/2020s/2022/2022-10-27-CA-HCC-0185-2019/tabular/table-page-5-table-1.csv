"In case of Haramanis v. Somalatha [1998] 3 Sri L.R"
"365, it was held;"
"“…The  law  in  its  wisdom  requires  that  the"
"statement  should  be  made  within  a  reasonable"
"time.  The  test  is  whether  it  was  made  as  early"
"as 
could 
reasonably 
be 
expected 
in 
the"
"circumstances  and  whether  there  was  or  was"
"not 
time 
for 
tutoring  and  concoction. 
It 
is  a"
"question  of 
fact  depending  on 
the  attendant"
"circumstances of the case. No hard and fast rule"
"can  be 
laid  down  as  to  when  a  statement 
is"
"sufficiently contemporaneous. …”"
