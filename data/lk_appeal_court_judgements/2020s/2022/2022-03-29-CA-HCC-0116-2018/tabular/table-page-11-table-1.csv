"Road and the officers had inquired about his acquaintance with Mohamed"
"Murshid Anwer. He had stated that it was the first time he went on a hire"
"with  Mohamed  Murshid  Anwer  on  that day.    At  that  time  the  other  police"
"officers  had  arrived  after  dropping  Mohamed  Murshid  Anwer’s  daughter."
"Both had been taken to Armour Street but only Mohamed Murshid Anwer"
"had been made to accompany the officers on the house searches thereafter."
"Therefore, the appellant was not taken for the house searches at that time."
"Thereafter  they  had  been  taken  to  Police  Narcotic  Bureau,  his  signature"
"obtained on a white coloured paper and had been detained there for seven"
"days  in  two  separate  cells.  Mohamed  Murshid  Anwer’s  wife  and  family"
"members  had  visited  him  during  his  detention  almost  every  day  and  had"
"maintained friendly chats with the officers at Police Narcotic Bureau. During"
"this time Mohamed Murshid Anwer was taken out several times for further"
"investigation. He was neither taken along with Mohamed Murshid Anwer nor"
"has  he  been  allowed  visits  from  his  family  members.  After  his  detention"
"period was over, he was produced before the Magistrate and remanded for"
"this case. After that only had he come to know that Mohamed Murshid Anwer"
"had  been  discharged  form  this  case.  According  to  him  he  was  remanded"
"instead of Mohamed Murshid Anwer."
"As discussed above, the conduct of PW1 after the arrest of the Appellant and"
"Mohamed Murshid Anwer was very suspicious. Both had been taken to and"
"detained at the Police Narcotic Bureau. But only the Appellant was taken to"
"various places for further investigation not by the PW1 and his team but by"
"a new team of the Police Narcotic Bureau. This position was admitted by PW1"
"in  his  evidence.  The  Appellant  had  never  been  taken  out  for  the  further"
"investigations. Even though, as claimed by the police the Heroin pertaining"
"to this case was detected from the Appellant, further investigation was not"
"done  as  to  clarify  the  method  of  transfer  of  Heroin  to  the  Appellant.  This"
"lethargic  conduct  of  the  police  creates  a  serious  doubt  in  the  prosecution"
"case."
