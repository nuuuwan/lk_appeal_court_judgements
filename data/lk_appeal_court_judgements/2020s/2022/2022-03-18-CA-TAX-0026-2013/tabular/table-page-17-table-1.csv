"shall be allowed for any disbursements or expenses not being money expended"
"for the purpose of producing the income. Can it be said that the management"
"expenses were disbursements expended for producing the dividends received"
"by   the   appellant   Company   from   investments   in   other   Companies?   I   do   not"
"think it can be. In England by virtue of section 33 of the Income Tax Act, 1918,"
"the management expense of any Company whose business consists mainly in"
"the   marking   of   investments   are   deductible.   No   such   provision   exists   in   the"
"Ceylon Ordinance and having regard to its absence I am unable to say that"
"management  expenses  can be deducted  in order  to ascertain the assessable"
"income.”"
"Hence as per Howard C. J., business expenses could not be deducted."
"In Ceylon Financial Investments Limited vs. Commissioner of Income Tax"
"Soertsz J., said,"
"“In regard to the next contention of the Acting Solicitor General that even if the"
"appellant company was carrying on a business and for that reason, came under"
"section   06(1)(a)   and   was   entitled   to   claim   deductions   on   account   of   the"
"management   expenses   of   that   business,   under   section   09(1)   yet   as   the   gain"
"derived by it from “dividends and interest” falls within the words “dividends,"
"interest or discounts” of section 06(1)(e) as  well, the crown is entitled to elect"
"under which of these heads 06(1)(a) or 06(1)(e) it will make its assessment, I"
"greatly regret that I cannot assent to the view taken by My Lord the Chief Justice"
"in   upholding   that   contention.   On   that   point   while   I   agree   with   my   brother"
"Keuneman that the crown has no such option and that “it was the intention of"
"the Ordinance to regard dividends, interest or discounts as a separate source”. I"
"venture to differ when he says that,"
