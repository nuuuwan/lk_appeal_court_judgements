"27. Although the appellant invited the court to distinguish the judgment in"
"Stafford Motor  Company  (Private) Limited  vs.  Commissioner  General  of"
"Inland Revenue CA (TAX) 17/2017, that case was in respect of an appeal"
"directly   made   to   the   Tax   Appeal   Commission   and   the   provisions   with"
"regard to time limits in that case are different. Hence distinguishing the"
"judgment in that case, which basically decided the question whether the"
"time limits are directory or mandatory does not arise."
"28. The  same reason applies  to Kegalle Plantations PLC  vs.  Commissioner"
"General of Inland Revenue CA (TAX) 09/2017 too."
"29. Hence   even   if   the   appellant   had   a   vested   right   on   the   appeal   being"
"determined by 07.03.2013 as it argues, it is vitiated by the revival, if not"
"resurrection, of the appeal by the provisions of section 15 of the second"
"amendment."
"30. If the argument of the Tax Appeal Commission that a “few days delay” in"
"sending notice of assessment is immaterial is accepted, the assessor only"
"has   to   make   the   assessment   within   the   stipulated   time   but   he   can"
"indefinitely delay the sending of the notice of assessment."
"31. But section 163(1) refers to “assess the amount….and shall by notice in"
"writing require such person to pay forthwith….” Section 163(1) also says"
"subject   to  the   provisions   of  subsection   (3)  and  (5).   It   is   section   163(5)"
"which has the time limit. Hence sending of notice also has to be done"
"within the prescribed time."
"32. Furthermore,   E.   Goonaratne   says   in   “Income   Tax   in   Sri   Lanka”,   first"
"edition at page 393, “Making an assessment culminates in the notice on"
"the   person   assessed.   An   assessment   is   made   when   the   assessment   is"
"sent”."
"33. Honig and others (administrators of Emmanuel Honig) vs. Sarsfield (H."
"M.   Inspector   of   Taxes)   cited   by   the   Tax  Appeal   Commission   has  to  be"
"distinguished because in England there was a book or a register to enter"
"the assessment, which is not the case in this country."
