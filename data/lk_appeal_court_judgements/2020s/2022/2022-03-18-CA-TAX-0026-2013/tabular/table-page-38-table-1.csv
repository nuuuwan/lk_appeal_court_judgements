"case,   “I   am   therefore   of   the   opinion   that   the   income   derived   by   the"
"appellant   company   from   dividends   and   interest   fall   within   the   words"
"“profits from any business” under section 6(1)(a)”."
"9. The question in that case was, that since the company was only a holding"
"company, management expenses on which income tax has been charged"
"could   be   deducted,   the   deduction   being   possible   only   if   the   dividend"
"income could be classified under section 6(1)(a)."
"10. Hence the assessee or the appellant wanted to argue that what it does is"
"“business”."
"11. It must be said that in the present case the learned President’s Counsel"
"for the appellant does not argue that what the appellant receives does not"
"form part of profits under section 3(1)(a). His position is that even if it"
"falls under that section, section 63 will make him not liable for income"
"tax."
"12. The assessor and the Commissioner of Income Tax argued in that case"
"that the appellant came under section 6(1)(e) which is “dividends, interest"
"or discounts which is same as section 3(1)(e) of the present Act."
"13. The   provisions   in   section   3(1)(a)   and   3(1)(e)   of   the   present   Act   are"
"ipsisima   verba  (similar   in  verbatim)   to   the  corresponding   provisions  in"
"section   6   of   Ordinance   No.   02   of   1932   under   which   that   case   was"
"decided."
"14. In   that   case   the   decision   was   in   favour   of   the   appellant   since   it   was"
"decided that the appellant is doing “business” it earns “profits” and it can"
"deduct “management expenses” from the “profits”."
"15. The learned Chief Justice said, “If the business of a company consists in"
"the receipt of dividends, interest or discounts alone or if such a business"
"can be clearly separated from the rest of the trade or business, then any"
"special provisions applicable to dividends, interest or discounts must be"
"applied”."
