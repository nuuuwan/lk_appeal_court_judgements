"If   what   was   said   in   the   present   judgment   is   summarized   it   will   appear   as",""
"below,",""
"1.","It is true that all income whether business or dividend income is income"
"","liable for income tax, as the State argues."
"","2. But   section   63   of   the   Inland   Revenue   Act   No.   10   of   2006   exempts   a"
"","dividend received from a residential or non residential company, if such"
"","dividend has been either tax paid, tax exempt or tax excluded from the"
"","statutory income of the receiving company."
"","3. A   further   clause   to   this   section   was   added   by   section   23   of   Inland"
"","Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 09 of 2015 which read,"
"","“For   the   purpose   of   this   section   the   profits   and   income   from   such"
"","dividends  which  form   part   of  the  profits  under  section   3(a) of  this  Act"
"","means profits and income after deducting expenses in ascertaining the"
"","profits from such business of receiving dividends”."
"","4. The amendment made in 2015 will have no sense if section 63 had no"
"","application to the dividends received that formed part of business income"
"","within the contemplation of section 3(a) of the Act."
"","5. The Tax Appeal Commission in its determination said that “Section 63"
"","does not have a bearing where the dividend income is earned as part of"
"","statutory income falling under section 3(a) of the Inland Revenue Act No."
"","10 of 2006”."
"","6. There   was   no   basis   for   the   Tax   Appeal   Commission   to   say   what   was"
"","stated in 05, since that is what section 63 said in plain language."
"7.","If the legislature was of the view that section 63 applied only to dividend"
"","income under section 3(e), there will be no necessity to amend section 63"
"","because no expenses are deductible when determining dividend income"
"","under section 3(e)."
"","8. The respondent cited the case of Ceylon Financial Investment Limited vs."
"","Commissioner of Income Tax as the learned Chief Justice decided in that"
