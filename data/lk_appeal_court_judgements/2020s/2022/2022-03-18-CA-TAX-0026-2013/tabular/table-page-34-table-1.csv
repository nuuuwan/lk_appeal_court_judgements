"that   “notice”   or   the   “assessment”   can   be   sent   “at   or   about   the   time”.   This"
"intrinsic defect  is even seen in the last quoted passage from Justice W.N.D."
"Perera’s   judgment.   In   the   aforequoted   passage   the   first   sentence   refers   to"
"“reasons” while the second sentence refers to the “assessment”. This is, with"
"respect,   the   inherent   defect   in   that   decision.   The   extrinsic   reason   for   the"
"inability of this court to apply that decision lies in the difference between the"
"relevant   revenue   legislations   then   and   now.   The   case   of   Philp   Upali"
"Wijewardene   (appellant)   vs.   C.   Kathiragamer   and   another   (respondent)   1992"
"was   decided   on   Inland   Revenue   Act   No.   04   of   1963   as   amended   by   Inland"
"Revenue (amendment) Law No. 30 of 1978. The said amendment dealt with the"
"duty to give reasons for not accepting the return which was not a requirement"
"in the law as existed prior to the said amendment. Giving of the notice was"
"referred to in section 95(1) of the Act which said,"
"“95."
