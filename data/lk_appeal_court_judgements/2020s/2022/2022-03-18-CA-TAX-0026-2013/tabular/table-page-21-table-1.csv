"Keuneman J., agreed with Howard C. J. (although it was not said expressly,"
"because   as   it   would   be   recalled   the   Chief   Justice   also   came   to   the   same"
"conclusion on the said point) although Soertsz J., has not agreed on that point."
"But De Kretser J., (who did not write a separate judgment) and Wijeyewardene"
"J.,   (who   gave   his   lordship’s   conclusions   in   point   form)   have   agreed   with"
"Keuneman J. Hence 04 judges out of 05 have agreed on that point, which is"
"hence the decision in that case."
"That is that, if dividends, etc., comes under source (e) as well as source (a), if"
"the business of the company consists in the receipt of dividends, etc., alone, or"
"if the business of receiving dividends, etc., can be clearly separated from the"
"rest   of   the   trade   or   business,   then   any   special   provisions   applicable   to   the"
"dividends, etc., must be applied without there been any question of an option."
"Thus  the  case  of  Ceylon  Financial Investments   Limited  vs.  Commissioner   of"
"Income   Tax   although   cited   for   the   respondent,   to   show   that   the   company"
"receiving dividends, etc., only was decided to be coming under section 06(1)(a)"
"of   the   Ordinance,   in   its   ratio   decidendi   has   assisted   the   appellant   in   the"
"present case."
"It may be noted that Keuneman J., further said, ‘"
"“It is no doubt true that the divisions into “sources” under section 06(1) does not"
"appear to be scientific and it is difficult to see on what grounds the division is"
"made. But we must take the Ordinance as we find it”."
"Thus the majority of the 05 judge Bench classified the appellant in that case"
"under   source   (e)   as   well   as   source   (a)   and   also   decided   that   any   special"
"provision applicable to dividends, etc., must apply."
"Hence the question of law No. 01 must be decided in favour of the appellant."
