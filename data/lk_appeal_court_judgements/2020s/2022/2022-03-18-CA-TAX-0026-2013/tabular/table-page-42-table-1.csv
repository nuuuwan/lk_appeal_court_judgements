"34. Philip   Upali   Wijewardene   vs.   C.   Kathiragamer   and   another   cannot   be"
"accepted for two reasons, one is intrinsic whereas the other is intrinsic."
"The   intrinsic   reason   is   that   in   that   case   the   court   referred   to   the"
"“reasons”   and   “assessment”,   interchangeably   due   to   confounding   what"
"was said in D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail regarding “at or about"
"the time”, which is a case specifically dealt with the duty to send reasons"
"and   not   the   duty   to   send   notices   within   the   time   limit.   The   extrinsic"
"reason is that unlike section 163(1) in the present Act where the making"
"of the assessment  and sending  of notices  are included  in one and the"
"same provision, which is also subject to the time limit, in that case under"
"the law No. 30 of 1978, which was the relevant legislation there was a"
"separate section 95 dealing with notice."
"35. Hence the decision of the Tax Appeal Commission that a “few days delay”"
"will not make the assessment invalid, is in violation of the provisions of"
"section 163(1) read with section 163(5)."
