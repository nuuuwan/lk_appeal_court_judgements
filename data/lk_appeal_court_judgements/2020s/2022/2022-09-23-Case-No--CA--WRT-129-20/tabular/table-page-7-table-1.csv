"The  Petitioner  Company  by  a  letter  dated  4th  October  2007  (marked  “R1”)  to  the"
"Central  Environmental  Authority  states  that  this  condition  is  “practically  impossible  to"
"maintain as the 80% of the year, the river flow will be less than 500 l/s”. A request is made"
"to revise the expected minimum discharge from the weir to more pragmatic levels."
"In the Counter Affidavit, it is stated that fixing the e-flow at 500 l/s is a “fundamental"
"flaw and defeats the basic norm scientifically determined by experimental verifications”. The"
"Petitioner  Company  contends  that  the  scientific  details  arrived  at  using  e-flow  at  500"
"liters/sec. is erroneous. Much ink was spilled trying to prove to this Court that this condition"
"is erroneous and lacks scientific reasoning."
"The Petitioner Company may or may not be right in this contention. Yet, for a Court"
"of law exercising its supervisory jurisdiction, it is well beyond our institutional competence"
"to make such a determination. As mentioned above, our supervisory role is circumscribed to"
"the ordinary grounds of judicial review. In the absence of an allegation of the same, we cannot"
"step into the shoes of an expert. This is a well-established position in Administrative Law,"
"the reason being that this Court does not have the benefit of expert evidence to help arrive"
"at the right conclusion. This is a matter that must be litigated in a forum in which  expert"
"opinion may be tried and tested."
"Another factor that  disentitles the Petitioner Company to claim the relief sought is"
"the fact of futility. Suppose if this Court were to quash the decisions of the 2nd Respondent to"
"refuse  environmental  approval  for  the  project  and  the  4th  Respondent’s  affirmation  of  the"
"decision of the 2nd Respondent to refuse project approval, the Petitioner Company would still"
"be unable to meet this “impossible” condition. There is no undertaking that this condition can"
"be met."
"In the case of P.S. Bus Co. v. Members and Secretary of Ceylon Transport Board 61"
"NLR 491 his Lordship Sinnetamby J. held:"
"“The prerogative writs are not issued as a matter of course and it is in the discretion"
"of Court to refuse to grant it if the facts and circumstances are such as to warrant a refusal."
"A writ, for instance, will not issue where it would be vexatious or futile.”"
