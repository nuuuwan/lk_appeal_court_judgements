"His Lordship held, “The organs of the State are guardians to whom the people have"
"committed  the  care  and  preservation  of the  resources  of  the  people.  This  accords  not  only"
"with  the  scheme  of  government  set  out  in  the  Constitution  but  also  with  the  high  and"
"enlightened conceptions of the duties of our rulers, in the efficient management of resources"
"in the process of development.”"
"Her  Ladyship  Shiranee  Tilakawardane  J.  in  Sugathapala  Mendis  v.  Chandrika"
"Kumaratunga [2008] 2 SLR 339 summarises the “Public Trust Doctrine” thus:"
"“The ""Public Trust Doctrine"" is based on the concept that the powers held by organs"
"of government are, in fact, powers that originate with the People, and are entrusted to the"
"Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary only as a means of exercising governance and"
"with the sole objective that such powers will be exercised in good faith for the benefit of the"
"People of Sri Lanka. Public power is not for personal gain or favour, but always to be used to"
"optimize the benefit of the People. To do otherwise would be to betray the trust reposed by"
"the  People  within  whom,  in  terms  of  the  Constitution,  the  Sovereignty  reposes.  Power"
"exercised  contrary  to  the  Public  Trust  Doctrine  would  be  an  abuse  of  such  power  and  in"
"contravention of the Rule of Law.”"
"Thus,  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  and  other  environmental  agencies  as"
"organs of the state must remember that the environment must be protected and preserved"
"for the benefit of the present generation and generations yet unborn. It is worth reiterating"
"Article  27(14)  of  the  Constitution  which  provides:  “The  State  shall  protect,  preserve  and"
"improve the environment for the benefit of the community”. Although it is expressly declared"
"in the Constitution that the Directive principles and fundamental duties  “do not confer or"
"impose legal rights or obligations and are not enforceable in any Court of Tribunal” Courts"
"have linked the Directive principles to the public trust doctrine and have stated that these"
"principles should guide state functionaries in the excise of their powers. (Vide Environmental"
"Foundation Ltd. v. Mahawali Authority of Sri Lanka [2010] 1 SLR 1)"
"Thus, we are unable to grant the relief prayed for because it is beyond this Court’s"
"institutional competence to make a judgment as to the environmental impact this project can"
"cause, as claimed by the Respondents. Even if the waterfall is ‘listed’, its close proximity to"
"one that is, and the potential or actual impact on the environment is a matter for a more"
"appropriate forum."
