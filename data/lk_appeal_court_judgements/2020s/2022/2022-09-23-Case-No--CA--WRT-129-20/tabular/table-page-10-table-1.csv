"I am mindful that the outcome of this project is said to be effective for 100 days of the"
"year,  and  the  need  for  a  continuous  supply  of  electricity  to  meet  the  country’s  daily"
"requirement and the Court should not be an obstacle in a genuine effort to meet that demand."
"However, when compared to the potential or actual environmental destruction, whether the"
"right balance in the cost-benefit analysis has been struck is doubtful."
"The Indian Supreme Court in Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India 2000 (10)"
"SCC 664 held:"
"“When there is a state of uncertainty due to lack of data or material about the extent"
"of damage or pollution likely to be caused then, in order to maintain the ecology balance, the"
"burden of proof that the said balance will be maintained must necessarily be on the industry"
"or the unit which is likely to cause pollution. On the other hand where the effect on ecology"
"or  environment  of  setting  up  of  an  industry  is  known,  what  has  to  be  seen  is  that  if  the"
"environment is likely to suffer, then what mitigative steps can be taken to off set the same."
"Merely because there will be a change is no reason to presume that there will be ecological"
"disaster.  It  is  when  the  effect  of  the  project  is  known  then  the  principle  of  sustainable"
"development would come into play which will ensure that mitigative steps are and can be"
"taken to preserve the ecological balance. Sustainable development means what type or extent"
"of  development  can  take  place  which  can  be  sustained  by  nature/ecology  with  or  without"
"mitigation.”"
