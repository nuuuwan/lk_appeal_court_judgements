"“It is thus acknowledged in this country that a mere statement from the bar that"
"a
 
particular counsel or registered attorney has no instruction is not enough to constitute"
"a
 
non appearance of the party. It is yet an appearance of the party. If it is intended that"
"the recognized agents I have mentioned above do no longer appear for the party, they"
"must inform Court that they do not appear for the party.”"
"The Registered Attorney present in Court at the time when the case is called must"
"clearly state that she is not appearing for the party concerned. Merely stating that the"
"Registered  Attorney  has  no  instructions  will  not  suffice.  A  clear  utterance  that  the"
"Registered Attorney is not appearing is what a plethora of case law has time after time"
"held to be the requirement."
"I
n terms of Section 88(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, there is a statutory right to"
"appeal against an order refusing to vacate the ex parte judgment and decree. However,"
"when  the  original  order  of  the  learned  District  Judge  to  hear  the  matter  ex  parte  is"
"erroneous  and  goes  to the  root  of the  case it is  a  nullity.    Consequent  orders  would  be"
"nullified as well. As his Lordship A.H.M.D. Nawaz J. in CA Case No. 994/1997(F) (supra)"
"put it: “If there was no default to purge, there could not be a purge default inquiry.”"
"When injustice and grave prejudice has occurred to the party applicant as a result"
"of the Court’s erroneous application of the law this Court can exercise its restitutionary"
"jurisdiction to remedy that injustice caused."
"T
herefore, we set aside the entire proceedings from the 21st of June 2011 and direct"
"the learned District Judge to recommence the trial inter-partes and further direct that"
"this matter is tried expeditiously. We make no order for costs."
