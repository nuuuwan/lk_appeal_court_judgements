"High Court-Administrative Court), the Court has quashed the Town Council’s decision to"
"impose  sanctions  on  the  Claimant.  So,  the  Claimant  was  the  successful  party  in  that"
"application. The Court departing from the general rule on costs, the conduct of the parties"
"in dealing with the dispute once it had arisen has been taken in to consideration and been"
"evaluated for the interest of justice. Finally, the Court in that case has made an order that"
"the said Council should pay the Claimant’s costs up to and including the 19th March 2016"
"and further, that the Claimant is liable for the costs that the Council incurred on and after"
"20th March 2016."
