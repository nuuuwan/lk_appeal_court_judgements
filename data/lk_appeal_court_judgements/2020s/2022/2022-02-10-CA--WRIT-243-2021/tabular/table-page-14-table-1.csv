"","in any event, no evidence adduced by the Applicants to demonstrate the same;’"
"iii.","‘the Arbitrator erred in fact and in law in purporting to determine that even with"
"","the cancellations of the special allowance, with effect from 01.12.2010 (by the"
"","letter dated 17.12.2010), the salary discrepancy in the executive Grades of the"
"","Petitioner company did not cease and still continued, whereas, the said finding/"
"","determination  cannot  withstand  objective  scrutiny  and 
indeed  cannot  be"
"","reconciled by any parity of reasoning, the same is patently erroneous, and is"
"","accordingly, vitiated in law;’"
"iv.","‘the Arbitrator erroneously purported to determine inter alia, that in making the"
"","impugned award, he has taken into consideration the financial impact on the"
"","Petitioner  company,  and  that  the  impugned  award  in  fair  by  the  Petitioner"
"","company, whereas, the impugned Award indicates to the contrary, and cannot"
"","be  reconciled,

the 
total  Award  amounts 
to  as  much  as"

"","ceased to exist, and now, by the impugned Award, the Petitioner company is"
"","effectively  being  compelled  to  retrospectively  grant  a  discontinued  special"
"","allowance to the 4th to 43rd Respondents;’"
"vi.","‘the Arbitrator erred by failing to take cognizance of the fact that, in any event,"
"","no seniority of any employee was violated, and nor was there any continuation"
"","of the payment in issue, warranting the impugned Arbitration Award;’"
"vii.","‘the Arbitrator erred by failing to take cognizance of the fact that in as much as"
"","the purported discrepancy was subsequently accepted as causing issues, and the"
"","allowance was discontinued in a bona fide endeavour by the subsequent Board"
"","of 
the  Petitioner  Company, 
the  Applicants 
thereafter,  had  no  remaining"
"","purported  cause  of  action,  nor  grievance 
in 
terms  of 
the 
law,  nor  most"
"","significantly, any legitimate expectation, and the only matter outstanding if at"
"","all, was the recovery of the additional payment from the said employees, which"
"","in any event, the Arbitrator conceded, was beyond the scope of his mandate;’"
