"The Supreme Court further held as follows."
"63. It would be a travesty of justice to allow the conviction on the two counts of"
"Rape and two counts of Kidnapping which had not been established, to remain."
"No  reasonable  court,  by  any  stretch  of  imagination  could  have  convicted  the"
"Accused of those offences had the trial proceeded to a conclusion."
"65.  I  am  reminded  of  the  words  of  his  Lordship  Justice  Soza  in  the  case  of"

"The provisions of law, especially in terms of Article 138 and Article 145, is wide"
"enough for this court to intervene to prevent what otherwise would be a serious"
"miscarriage of justice."
"The provisions of Articles 138 and 145 of the Constitution are as follows."
