"Although this aspect has been considered by the learned High Court Judge, I am"
"not  in  a  position  to  agree  with  his  finding  that  there  was  no  basis  for  him  to"
"convict the appellants on the basis of section 297 of the Penal Code."
"As pointed out correctly by the learned Counsel, I find that if considered in the"
"correct perspective, there was sufficient evidence before the learned High Court"
"Judge to consider this matter in terms of exception 4 of section 294 of the Penal"
"Code."
"As I have determined earlier, there was clear evidence that this incident was a"
"result of a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel. It is also"
"clear that there was no premeditation of any kind on the part of the appellants."
"The weapon used had been a knife which may have been available at the house"
"when  this  incident  happened,  which  shows  that  the  assailant  had  not  taken"
"undue advantage."
"For the reasons adduced as above, I am of the view that this is not a case where"
"the appellants should have been convicted for the offence of murder."
"Accordingly, I set aside the conviction of the appellants on count one and convict"
"them for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under section"
"297 of the Penal Code on the basis of a sudden fight in terms of exception 4 of"
"the section 294 of the Penal code."
"Having considered the facts and the circumstances of this case, I sentence the"
"1st and the 2nd accused appellants for a term of 10 years rigorous imprisonment."
"In addition, the first and the second accused appellants are ordered to pay a fine"
"of Rs. 20000/- each. In default, I direct that they should serve 6 months each of"
"simple imprisonment."
"The  sentence  imposed  on  the  1st  accused  appellant  in  relation  to  the  second"
"count preferred against him shall remain the same."
