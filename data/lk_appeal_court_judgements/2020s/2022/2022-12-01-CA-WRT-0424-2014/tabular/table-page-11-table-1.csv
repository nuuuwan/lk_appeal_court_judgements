"paragraph 18 of the petition and there is no evidence to show that no questions"
"regarding the Petitioners’ area of work other than their present duties and the"
"profits shown in the last year were put to them and the interview board was not"
"bothered to check the certificates they had. The Petitioners state that in allotting"
"marks for personality the board neither sought any relevant certificates nor did"
"question  regarding  their  area  of  work.  When  testing  for  personality  it  is  not"
"necessary to examine the certificates or question regarding their area of work."
"It is always not necessary to carry out a test in order to arrive at a fair and a"
"satisfactory evaluation of the personality of the candidates."
"There is no material to show that the 30th and 31st Respondents were not eligible"
"to  apply  for  the  promotion  and  the  1st  –  8th  Respondents  had  denied  that"
"allegation. There is also no material to show that the 32nd Respondent had not"
"applied for the promotion. The Respondents had denied that allegation also. The"
"learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioners  has  made  an  attempt  to  introduce  new"
"evidence by way of written submissions. He has stated that the 9th Respondent"
"had been fined Rs.250 and therefore did not have a satisfactory service. New"
"material  had  been  introduced  in  respect  of  the  period  of  service  of  the  36th"
"Respondent. Based on that new material the learned Counsel for the Petitioners"
"has submitted that the 36th Respondent should have been allotted less marks."
"Similar evidence had been introduced in respect of the period of service of the"
"39th Respondent to show that he had only a period of 08 years in service. The"

"and they become facts which are not supported by an affidavit. Therefore, those"
"facts cannot be treated as evidence and they cannot be taken into consideration"
"at this stage."
"The Petitioners, in their petition and affidavit had stated that the junior officers"
"have been promoted, disregarding the Petitioners, on the basis that they have"

"promoted had exceeded the minimum mark necessary for the selection with the"
"aid of marks obtained for the personality evaluation. The 1st Petitioner who had"
"got  30  marks  (full  marks)  for  the  experience  had  got  only  04  marks  in  the"
"personality evaluation. The 3rd Respondent who had also got 30 marks for the"
"experience had got only 05 marks in the personality evaluation. But it is  also"
"important to note that the 2nd Petitioner had obtained 17 marks for personality"
"evaluation  and  the  5th  Respondent  also  had  got  16  marks  for  personality"
"evaluation.  Both  had  scored  comparatively  less  marks  for  the  service.  That"
