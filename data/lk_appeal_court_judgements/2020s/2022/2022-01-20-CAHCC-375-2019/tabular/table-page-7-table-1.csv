"PW-01 has not seen the initial incident where a relative of him  was  assaulted"
"and  has  not  spoken  about  any  involvement  of  the  appellant  to  that  incident."
"What he has seen was the presence of the appellant near the parked lorry and"
"him driving towards him."
"The  evidence  led  in  this  action  clearly  establishes  that  the  PW-01  and  his"
"mother had gone to the place where the appellant resided in order to meet him"
"after  hearing  about  a  dispute  the  appellant's  brotherâ€™s  children  had  with  a"
"relative  of  PW-01.  By  the  time  they  reached  the  place,  the  initial  incident"
"appears to have been over. It is evident that PW-01 had to run back towards to"
"Colombo-Galle  main  road  in  order  to  avoid  being  assaulted.  According  to  the"
"own admission of the appellant it was the lorry driven by him that crashed into"
"the people, including the Police officers who were on the pavement of the main"
"road, although it was his position that they fell onto the road."
"I am unable to find any reason to find the evidence of PW-01 as not credible in"
"the given the circumstances, hence, I find no merit in the ground of appeal."
"Second Ground of Appeal: -"
"It has been proved that the byroad from where the appellant entered the main"
"road was only a short distance away from the place of the incident. Hence, the"
"appellant ought to have had the clear knowledge that in all probabilities death"
"or  serious  injuries  would  occur  to  the  people  on  the  road  when  the  lorry  was"
"driven in the manner he did."
"In  his  judgment  the  learned  trial  judge  has  considered  the  evidence  based  on"
"the  intention  to  conclude  that  the  appellant  is  guilty  of  murder.  I  am  of  the"
"view that even if one can argue that there was no intention on the part of the"
"appellant  to  commit  murder,  the  appellant  can  still  be  found  guilty  based  on"
"his knowledge as per the fourth limb of section 294 of the Penal Code as rightly"
"pointed out by the learned DSG and as the facts speaks for itself."
