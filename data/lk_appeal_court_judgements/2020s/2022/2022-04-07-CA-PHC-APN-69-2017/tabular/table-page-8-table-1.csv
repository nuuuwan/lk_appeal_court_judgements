"16.12.2016 acquits the respondent on charges under the Bribery Act on"
"the  basis  that  the  prosecution  failed  to  establish  the  charges  beyond"
"reasonable doubt.  We are in agreement of this determination."
"It is clear from the above examination that the prosecution has failed to"
"prove,  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  that  the  respondent  has  committed"
"bribery offences.  This is  evinced  by  the  failure  to  satisfactorily  establish"
"the  purpose 
for  which 
the  money  was  solicited/  accepted  by 
the"
"respondent on the date of the raid. Furthermore, credibility of PW01, the"
"virtual complainant has been shaken and it is evident that she has lodged"
"the  complaint  against  the  respondent  due  to  her  demotion 
from  an"
"instructor to a labourer in the Palmyrah Development Board."
"Taking into consideration all of the above, it is the considered view of this"
"Court  that  the 
impugned  order  dated  16.12.2016  does  not  warrant"
"interference under the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal."
"Application dismissed."
