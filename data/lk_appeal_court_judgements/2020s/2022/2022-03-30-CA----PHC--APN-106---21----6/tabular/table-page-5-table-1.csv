"In the case of CA/PHC/APN68/2021 this bench has considered the delay in"
"commencing the trial in a similar matter and it was held that the delay in"
"commencing the trial had been reasonably explained which does not constitute"
"exceptional circumstances."
"According to Chapter III, Article 13(4) of the Constitution which says that ‘’ No"
"person shall be punished with death or imprisonment except by order of a"
"competent court, made in accordance with procedure established by law."
"The arrest, holding in custody, detention or other deprivation of personal"
"liberty of a person, pending investigation or trial, shall not constitute"
"punishment.”"
"Therefore, it has been enshrined in the Constitution itself that a person under"
"arrest should not be detained in custody depriving his personal liberty, pending"
"investigation or trial without a justifiable reason."
"The same has been very lengthily discussed by the former Chief Justice Sarath"
"Silva in the judgment of Sumanadasa Vs. Attorney General (Sri Lanka Law reports"
"2006 pg 202) where he has stated that “…fundamental rights of the petitioners"
"guaranteed by the Article 13(2) have been infringed … being detained in custody"
"merely upon being produced in courts and incarcerated without a remedy until"
"the conclusion of their trials."
"As such in view of the facts and the law cited above this Court is of the opinion"
"that the instant application for revision should be allowed and the impugned"
"order dated 18.3.2021 be set-aside and the petitioner namely Norbert"
"Oadmanadanalis Robert be enlarged on suitable conditions of bail to the High"
"Court."
"As such we direct the learned High Court Judge to enlarge the petitioner on"
"suitable conditions of bail and the Registrar of this Court is directed to convey the"
"above order to the relevant High Court."
