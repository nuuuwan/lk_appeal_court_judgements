"Hence up to now what has evolved is that the exceptionality would be decided by"
"the facts of each case, but in the case of Carder vs. OIC Narcotics Bureau 2006 3"
"SLR 74 Eric Basnayake J had said that,"
"“these types of offences affect the society at large and the law should not be"
"made impotent that it does not serve the society  and the anty social elements"
"should not be given license to create havoc in the society” citing the case of"
"Abdul Hamidkari Path and etc vs. the State of Gujarat and other 15 476."
"Therefore while making note of the law pertaining to the instant matter this"
"Court takes in to consideration the numerous times the substantive case has"
"gone down on numerous occasions without trial being taken up due to the"
"applications of the prosecution."
"The law pertaining to the instant matter has provided for the accused person to"
"be remanded until the conclusion of the trial if not for exceptional circumstances,"
"but it is not meant to be used to keep the accused persons in remand for"
"uncertain lengthy periods violating the basic right of a person for free movement"
"provided for by the Constitution itself."
"The proceedings in the High Court clearly indicates the lack of preparation by the"
"prosecution on numerous occasions, which were sometimes unavoidable and"
"sometimes due to sheer lack of preparedness for the case which this Court notes"
"with disappointment. (As per proceedings dated 7.6.2019, 19.9.2019, 10.12.2019)"
"According to the petitioner he had been in remand for nearly 7 years."
"But the respondents have stated very vehemently that Court should take in to"
"account the serious nature of the charge and that trial has already commenced"
"and the petitioner has not stated any exceptional grounds."
"But this Court is very much aware of the seriousness of the charge and the"
"sentence if convicted, but that does not provide for any person to be incase rated"
"for long periods of time without the trial concluding."
"Therefore there is a delay in the proceedings against the accused and in the"
"judgment cited by the petitioner by KumidiniWickramasinghe J the term delay"
"has been considered very illustriously and it has concluded that a delay of 7 years"
"as being ‘excessive and oppressive”."
