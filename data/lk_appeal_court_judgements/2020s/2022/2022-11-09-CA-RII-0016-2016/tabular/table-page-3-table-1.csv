"As per the Written Submissions of the petitioner petitioner (who is not a party in"
"the  partition  action)  the  Preliminary  Plan  is  No.  1468  dated  18.01.1984  and"
"31.01.1984. It is marked as X.2A. The judgment was entered on 13.12.2004. The"
"Interlocutory  Decree  was  entered  on  25.02.2016.  The  Commission  for  Final"
"Scheme was issued to Mr. Malith M. de Silva, L.S. His Final Plan is No. 2705"
"dated 07.04.2016 and 18.05.2016. It is marked as X.13. Hence, X.13 was made"
"32 years after the making of X.2A."
"The petitioner’s position is that the “Wal Ehela Tree”, which was shown in X.2A"
"as “out” (outside the Northern Boundary) has come into the land shown in X.13."
"He says that Mr. Malith de Silva, L.S., has shifted the Northern boundary"
"towards North encroaching upon a private road."
"The plaintiff denies that there was a widening of Daladawatte Road. His position"
"is that Mr. Malith de Silva has not shown the “Wal Ehela” tree since it is not on"
"the  boundary.  Denying  that  there  was  any  widening  of  Daladawatte  road,  the"
"plaintiff  states  that  Mr.  Malith  de  Silva has  not  included  in  his  plan  the  land"
"towards the North of the land shown in the Preliminary Plan."
"Hence the basic question is, whether in X.13 the Northern boundary was shifted"
"towards North."
"The  petitioner  states  that  X.14  “a  sketch”  was  prepared  by  Mr.  W.  R.  M."
"Fernando, L.S. on 05.10.2016. As per the petitioner Mr. Fernando has surveyed"
"the private road towards the North of the subject matter."
"The said “Sketch” has been prepared at the request of Thushara Gunethilake,"
"who  is  the  petitioner.  His  “Sketch”  shows  the  Northern  boundary  of  X.2A  in"
"“blue”. It shows Northern boundary of X.13 in “green”.  It shows the Southern"
"boundary of Lot. 4 I and drain shown in plan No. 2 dated 16.06.1997 made by"
"A.M.R.  Jayasekera  L.S.,  (X.10)  in  “red”.  It  shows  the  resurvey  of  the  existing"
"boundaries of Lot. 4 I of the said plan in “black”."
