"Hence at this juncture this Court refers to a judgment by His Lordship S.N.Silva CJ The"
"Attorney General vs. Joseph Aloysius and others Sri Lanka Law Reports 1992 PAGE 264"
"where it was held that the evidence at an identification parade “….is a means by"
"which evidence of identity is obtained. But it is certainly not the only means by which"
"it could be established that a witness identified the accused as the person who"
"committed the offence”"
"It has also been considered in the case of Keerthi Bandara vs. Attorney General 2000 2"
"Sri L.R. 266 that whether a witness at the trial could state before Court that he"
"identified the accused at the parade, and it has been stated by Jayasuriya J that there"
"has to be a distinction between the evidence at the trial identifying the accused and"
"the evidence at the parade identifying the accused. In the same judgement Jayasuriya"
"J had cited a cursus curiae emanating from the Supreme Court of India laying down"
"the principle that the results of an identification parade do not constitute substantive"
"evidence””"
"Hence in the instant matter the evidence led at the trial the witnesses had only"
"mentioned about the accused being identified at the parade and not in Court."
"Hence although the Counsel for the petitioner has averred strenuously that the"
"sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge is grossly inadequate in view of the"
"gravity of the offence, this Court sees no reason to interfere with the sentence"
"imposed by the trial judge in view of the non-identification of the accused in Court"
"and the time period which has elapsed from the date of offence to up to date which is"
"nearly 16 years and the period in remand of the accused leading up to the trial.."
"As such this Court sees no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment of the trial"
"judge; as such the instant application for revision is dismissed."
