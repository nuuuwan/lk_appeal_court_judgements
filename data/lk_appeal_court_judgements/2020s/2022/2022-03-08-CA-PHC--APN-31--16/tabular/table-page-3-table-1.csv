"The accused respondents (hereinafter referred to as the respondents) were indicted"
"for the offences of 380 and 383 of the Penal Code."
"The accused respondents had pleaded not guilt and trial had commenced and half way"
"through the respondents had tendered a plea of guilty and the Learned High Court"
"Judge had proceeded to accept the plea and had sentenced the respondents as follows,"
"1st respondent, 1st charge 12 months RI suspended for 10 years and a fine of Rs 2500"
"with no default term,"
"2nd charge 12 months RI suspended for 10 years with a fine of Rs 2500 with no default"
"term and with Rs 100000 compensation for the 1st witness with a default term,"
"2nd and 3rd respondents 1st charge 2 years RI suspended for 10 years, no fine but with"
"compensation to be paid to the 1st witness of the prosecution."
"The petitioner being aggrieved by the said sentencing had lodged the instant application"
"for revision."
"It is a well understood principle of law that if a party files a revision application the party"
"filling the same must satisfy this Court that there are instances of grave miscarriage of"
"justice which shocks the conscious of this Court."
"The main contention of the petitioner is that the sentence imposed by the learned High"
"Court Judge is grossly inadequate."
"The learned High Court Judge in her judgment has considered the age the previous"
"convictions of the 1st and the 3rd accused and the fact that some of the robbed items"
"have been recovered and returned to the owners."
"According to the facts of the case the respondents had been armed with firearms and"
"had entered the place of business and had tied the sales girls and had robbed the"
"electronic items belonging to the place around 3 in the afternoon."
"On perusing the evidence adduced it is very clear that lay witnesses and the evidence of"
"the police had been led but the lay witnesses only refer to an identification of the"
"accused at a parade and not in Court. Hence the identification of the accused is solely"
"based on the identification at the parade. Hence the question arises whether that is"
"sufficient to find an accused person guilty of an offence"
