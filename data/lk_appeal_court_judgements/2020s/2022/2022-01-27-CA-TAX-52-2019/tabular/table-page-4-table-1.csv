"to the TAC in violation of Section 9 (2) of the TAC Act. Regardless of this"
"claim,  the  Appellant  has  tendered  the  relevant  documents  to  this  Court"
"along  with  the  motion  dated  24th  June  2020,  with  the  agreement  of  the"
"Respondent. Although the learned Senior State Counsel reserved the right"
"to raise objections, if any, with regard to the said motion, no objections"
"were raised until this matter was fixed for judgment. Therefore, this Court"
"is obliged to conclude that the Respondent does not have any objections"
"regarding the reception and consideration of those documents."
"It was argued by the learned Counsel for the Appellant that all taxes impose"
"or create a burden on the subject and therefore, no tax, rate or levy shall be"
"imposed except by or under the authority of a law passed by Parliament."
"Citing Vallibel Lanka (Pvt) Limited v. Director General of Customs and"
"three others,1 it was submitted that the intention to impose duties and/or"
"taxes must be shown by clear and unambiguous language and cannot be"
"inferred by ambiguous words. Also cited in support was Article 148 of the"
"Constitution of Sri Lanka which provides that no tax, rate or any other levy"
"shall  be  imposed  except  by  or  under  the  authority  of  a  law  passed  by"
"Parliament. The learned Counsel also cited Maxwell on The Interpretation"
"of Statutes, where it is stated that:2"
"‘It is a well settled rule of law that all charges upon the subject must be"
"imposed by clear and unambiguous language… There is no presumption"
"as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied.’"
"Having cited the aforesaid material, the leaned Counsel for the Appellant"
"argued that the sum which is subject to the assessment, assumed to be in"
"the hand of the Appellant, is not taxable in terms of the Inland Revenue"
"Act. He contended that only the ‘profits or income’ as defined in the Act,"
"derived from a source specified in the Act and calculated in accordance"
"with  the  provisions  of  the  Act  can  be  taxed.  The  phrase  ‘profits’  or"
"‘income’ is defined in Section 217 and the sources of income subject to"
"income tax are set out in Section 3 of the Act."
