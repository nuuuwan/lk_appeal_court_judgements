"The  Respondents  filed  objections  to  the  said  writ  application  of  the  Appellant  and  after  filing"
"written submissions by both parties, the learned High Court Judge made an Order dismissing the"
"said  writ  application  on  the  basis  that  no  irregularity,  irrationality  or  procedural  impropriety"
"committed in the course of arbitration."
"B
eing  aggrieved  by  the  said  Order  dated  08.12.2015  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  the"
"Appellant preferred this appeal on the following grounds."
"a)  The Order dated 08.12.2015 is unjust and contrary to Law."
