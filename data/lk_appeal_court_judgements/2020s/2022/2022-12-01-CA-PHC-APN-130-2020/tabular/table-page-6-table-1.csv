"However,  the  learned  Magistrate  and  the  High  Court  Judge  have  held  on  the"
"incorrect  legal  position  that  the  State  Plantations  Corporation  is  a  government"
"department or institution."
"I
n the Court of Appeal,  it was held in Alwis Vs. Wedamulla Additional Director"
"General  UDA  [1997]  3  SLR  417  by  Jayasuriya,  J.  that  the  Magistrate  had  no"
"jurisdiction  to  entertain  the  State  Lands  (Recovery  of  Possession)  action  due  to"
"following reasons:"
"“The  Urban  Development  Authority  Act  (as  amended)  states  that  the  Urban"
"Development Authority is a body corporate which can institute proceedings and also"
"be sued in legal proceedings. Thus, it is a legal persona which could have instituted"
"proceedings  even 
in 
its  own  name. 
In  addition  the  statute  provides  for  the"
"‘competent authority’ to institute proceedings on behalf of the Urban Development"
"Authority. Having regard to the definition of the term ""Competent Authority"" in the"
"Urban  Development  Authority  Act,  it  is  manifest  that  the  Additional  Director"
"General is not a Competent Authority. If there had been a delegation of powers,"
"rights and functions of the Director-General of the Urban Development Authority"
"to  the  Additional  Director-General,  then  the  petition  and  affidavit  filed  in  the"
"Magistrate's  Court  ought 
to  have 
set  out  and  pleaded 
such  delegation  or"
"appointment. There is no averment in the affidavit and in the documents filed that"
"the  powers  of  the  Director-General  have  been  delegated  on  A.  Wedamulla,  the"
"Additional Director-General did not have a locus standi and a right and status to"
"institute these proceedings."
"S
econdly, 
the  proceedings 
in  ejectment 
could  be 
instituted  by 
the  Urban"
"Development Authority against a person who is in occupation of land vested in the"
"Urban  Development  Authority  provided such  applications  to  eject  are  authorised"
"and have had the written approval of the Minister of Housing. Thus, the statutory"
"provisions of the Urban Development Authority Act and the State Lands (Recovery"
"of Possession) Act set out a condition precedent for the filing of applications for"
"ejectment  before  the  Magistrate's  Court  and  even  if  an  application  is  wrongly"
"accepted  without 
such  authority, 
the 
learned  Magistrate  would  not  have"
"jurisdiction,  without  the  satisfaction  of  the  condition  precedent,  to  further"
"exercise jurisdiction upon such application."
