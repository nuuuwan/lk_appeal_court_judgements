"invalid. He cannot contest any of the matters stated in the application made under"
"Section 5 of the Act. One of the matters required to be stated in the application"
"is that the land described in the schedule to the application is in the opinion of"
"the  competent  authority  State  Land.  This  fact  cannot  be  contested  by  the"
"person summoned....”"

"to a finding that the Respondent is the competent authority in terms of Section 18"
"of the Act. As already established above, in terms of either Section 18(h) or 18(l)"
"the  Respondent  can  be  considered  as  the  competent  authority  under  the  Act.  As"
"such, there are no grounds to challenge the legality of the Order dated 13.10.2020"
"in that regard."
