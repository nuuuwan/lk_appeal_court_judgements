"arises  on 
the  mere 
fact 
that 
the  prosecution  case  rested  on 
the"
"uncorroborated evidence of a solitary prosecution witness.‚Äù"
"According to PW4, the three-wheeler driver, on the date of the incident the"
"Appellant had come to the Foreign Services Agency at Kirimandala Mawatha,"
"Narahenpita entered the office and returned in about 30 minutes time and"
"got  in  to  the  three-wheeler.  Once  she  sat  inside  the  three-wheeler  two"
"persons  had  come  beside  and  spoken  to  her.  During  the  conversation  the"
"Appellant  had  with  the  two  persons,  he  overheard  that  the  Appellant"
"inquiring as to whether the money was counted."
"PW1 and PW2 had gone up to the three-wheeler to hand over the money to"
"the Appellant. According to PW1, he was the person who gave the money to"
"the  Appellant.  Both  PW1  and  PW2 
in  their  evidence  corroborated  the"
"evidence of PW4 very well. Further, without receiving money, the Appellant"
"would  not  have  asked  whether 
the  money  was  counted.  PW4 
is  an"
"independent witness who knew the Appellant for about two years before this"
"incident. Considering the evidence of PW4, there is no doubt created on the"
"prosecution case. Hence, this ground also sans any merit."
"The Appellant in her dock statement stated that two unknown persons had"
"dropped a cash bundle on her lap when she was seated in the three-wheeler."
"But there is not an iota of evidence which surfaced to corroborate that either"
"PW2 or the officers from the Bribery Commission had any sinister motive to"
"fabricate  a  Bribery  case  against 
the  Appellant.  Unless 
the  Appellant"
"communicated  her  movement  to  PW2,  they  would  not  have  gone  to  the"
"Foreign  Services  Agency  at  Kirimandala  Mawatha  on  that  day  on  that"
"particular time. Further, the independent witness, PW4 had confirmed that"
"the Appellant had gone inside the Foreign Services Agency at Kirimandala"
