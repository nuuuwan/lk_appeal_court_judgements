"of  section  300  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code.  In  Kikar"
"Singh Indian Supreme Court held,"
"â€œThe  counsel  attempted  to  bring  the  case"
"within  exception  4.  For 
its  application  all 
the"
"conditions enumerated therein must be satisfied."
"The 
act 
must 
be 
committed 
without"
"premeditation  in  a  sudden  fight  in  the  heat  of"
"passion;  (2)  upon  a  sudden  quarrel;  (3)  without"
"the  offender  having  taken  undue  advantage;  (4)"
"and  the  accused  had  not  acted 
in  a  cruel  or"
"unusual  manner.  Therefore, 
there  must  be  a"
"mutual  combat  or  exchanging  blows  on  each"
"other.  And  however  slight 
the 
first  blow,  or"
"provocation,  every  fresh  blow  becomes  a  fresh"
"provocation.  The  blood 
is  already  heated  or"
"warms up at every subsequent stroke. The voice"
"of  reason  is  heard  on neither  side  in  the  heat of"
"passion.  Therefore, 
it 
is  difficult 
to  apportion"
"between  the  respective  degrees  of  blame  with"
"reference 
to 
the 
state 
of 
things 
at 
the"
"commencement of the fray but it must occur as a"
"consequence 
of 
a 
sudden 
fight 
i.e.  mutual"
"combat  and  not  one  side  track.  It  matters  not"
"what the cause of the quarrel is, whether real or"
