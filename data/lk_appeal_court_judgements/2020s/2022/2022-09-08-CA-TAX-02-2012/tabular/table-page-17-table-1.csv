"Appellant’s appeal on the basis that the tax exemption granted under the"
"BOI agreement is confined to the types of income and profits specified in"
"the  agreement.  I  acknowledge  that  the  TAC's  task  is  not  to  determine"
"policy matters but, to determine whether the assessment determined by the"
"CGIR is excessive or erroneous. Yet, it is pertinent to note that one of the"
"objectives  of  the  Legislature  in  establishing  the  BOI  is  ‘to  foster  and"
"generate economic development of the republic’13. Therefore, in my view,"
"the TAC has rightly taken into account Section 3  (a) of the BOI Act in"
"determining the scope of the exemption granted under paragraph 10 (i) of"
"the agreement."
"The first question of law is formulated on the assumption that the Appellant"
"is immune from liability to pay income tax chargeable under  the IR Act"
"due  to  the  clause  10  (i)  of  BOI  agreement.  It  must  be  noted  that  the"
"Appellant  received  the  said  interest  income  not  from  engaging  in  the"
"business of manufacturing and marketing of rolled steel products, but from"
"making short term deposits with commercial banks.  If the Appellant did"
"not make such deposits with banks, then the Appellant would not receive"
"such an interest income. Thus, interest income received by the Appellant"
"from making such deposits cannot be taken as an interest income received"
"in connection with and/or in relation to the business of the enterprise to be"
"treated  as  exempted  under  the  BOI  agreement.  This  interest  income  is"
"separate from the trading income of the Appellant, and thus not immune"
"from liability to pay tax."
"The second question of law is formulated on the basis that the TAC erred"
"in  law  in  arriving  at  the  conclusion  that  the  Appellant’s  deposits  in  the"
"banks  were  investments  made  with  the  intention  of  receiving  interest."
"However, it is important to note that the TAC has  not arrived at such a"
"conclusion in its determination."
"The third question of law is formulated on the following statement made"
"by the TAC in its determination: ‘Clause 10 (1) of the BOI agreement has"
"granted a tax exemption for a period of 3 years in relation to the business"
"of  the  enterprise  namely  manufacturing  and  marketing  of  rolled  steel"
"products, so that the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000,"
"relating  to  imposition  payment  and  recovery  of  income  tax  should  not"
"apply to the profits and income of the Enterprise’. The Appellant relied on"
"the statement: ‘the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000,"
