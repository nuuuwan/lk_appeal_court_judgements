"In the case of Liquidators of Pursa Ltd v. Commissioner of Income Tax,"
"Bihar8  the  Court  observed  that  ‘In  construing  an  Act  which  imposes  a"
"burden,  doubts,  should  be  resolved  in  favour  of  the  tax-payer  but  this"
"general  rule  cannot  be  applied  when  the  taxing  provision  is  clear  and"
"explicit  or  when  a  doubt  arises  in  regard  to  a  provision  granting  a"
"deduction of an exemption from payment of tax.’"
"It  was  the  Appellant  who  asserted  that  the  Appellant  earned  interest  in"
"terms of the agreements with the banks for the amounts deposited into the"
"Appellant's  accounts  during  the  credit  period  offered  by  the  consignee."
"Accordingly, in my view, it is the Appellant who should have produced"
"these agreements and satisfied the authorities with his claim. I therefore"
"find that there is no obligation on the Court to refer the matter back to the"
"TAC to ascertain further evidence."
"Based  on 
the  foregoing  analysis, 
it 
is  my  considered  view 
that 
the"
"Appellant has failed to satisfy that the Appellant meets the second test set"
"out  by  Howard  C.J.,  and  Keuneman  J.  In  my  view, 
interest  on 
the"
"Appellant's deposits in this case does not flow from transactions entered"
"into to carry on its business and does not correspond to income  exempt"
"under Clause 10 (i) of the agreement with the BOI, read along with Section"
"3 (a) of the IR Act."
"In  the  judgment  of  Wijeyewardene  J.,  in  the  CFI  case,  His  Lordship"
"concluded that the CGIR has an option to decide under which source the"
"income  should  fall.  However,  this  view  was  not  endorsed  by  any  other"
"judge.  Keuneman 
J., 
expressly 
repudiated 
the  view 
expressed  by"
"Wijeyewardene J., and observed that the same view expressed by Akbar J.,"
"in the previous case of the Commissioner of Income Tax v. Arunachalam"
"Chettiar9 was only an additional reasoning which could be reviewed in the"
"case at hand. On the above point, Soertsz J., also agreed with Keuneman J."
"Howard C.J., was of the view that the statement of Wijeyewardene J., was"
"merely  obiter.  Therefore, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the  view 
expressed  by"
"Wijeyewardene  J.,  regarding  the  option  available  to  the  CGIR  does  not"
"form part of the majority judgement."
"The  Appellant  also  cited  the  following  passage  from  the  judgment  of"
"Soertsz J., (with whom de Kretser J., agreed)"
