"made 
in 
the  TAC  determination10  ‘The  Ceylon  Financial  Investment"
"Limited  v.  Commissioner  of  Income 
tax  was  a  case  relating 
to  an"
"investment  company,  and  therefore,  the  interest  income  and  dividends"
"received  were  treated  as  part  of  trading  profits,  whereas  the  appellant"
"company,  in  this  case  is  not  an  investment  company,  but  a  company"
"engaged 
in 
the  business  of  manufacturing  and  making  rolled  steel"
"products.’ However, in my view, the TAC has made the above distinction"
"between 
the  CFI 
judgment  and 
this  case,  only 
for 
the  purpose  of"
"distinguishing the facts and the TAC has not arrived at its determination on"
"the basis that the Appellant is not entitled to the tax exemption as it is not"
"an investment company."
"Another  argument  advanced  by  the  Appellant  was  that  the  TAC  has"
"wrongly applied the judgment in the English case of Nuclear Electric Plc"
"v.  Bradley11  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Nuclear  Electric  case).  Both"
"CGIR  and  TAC  relied  on  the  Nuclear  Electric  case  in  arriving  at  their"
"determination.  It  is  a  case  where  the  tax  payer  whose  business  was"
"generating  electricity  has  set  aside  part  of  his  business  proceeds  as  an"
"investment  to be  utilized  later  as  expenditure  in  the  same  business.  The"
"Court held that this course is not within the meaning of ‘trading income’"
"and,  ‘investment  income’  cannot  be  converted  into  ‘trading  income’  by"
"simply setting up a segregated fund. It was further held that the test is to"
"see  whether  the  investment  form  an  integral  part  of  the  business.  The"
"Appellant’s  contention  was  that  the  English  Courts  have  considered  a"
"different  provision  of  the  English  statue  which  is  not  comparative  to"
"Section  3  of  the  IR  Act.  It  is  true  that  the  provision  considered  in  the"
"Nuclear Electric case is Section 393 of the Income and Corporation Taxes"
"Act,  1988  of  the  United  Kingdom  where  the  term  trading  income  was"
"interpreted in Section 393 (8) itself. In the said case the issue was whether"
"the income from the investments fell within the scope of that section to be"
"considered as trading income."
"Therefore, I agree with the submission of the Appellant that the judgment"
"in  the  case  of  Nuclear  Electric  is  not  conclusive  in  the  application  of"
"Section 3 of the IR Act. Yet, the principle set out in the Nuclear Electric"
"case that ‘investment income’ cannot be converted into ‘trading income’"
"by simply creating up a segregated fund is to some extent equivalent to the"
"procedure adopted by the Appellant by remitting the payment in advance"
