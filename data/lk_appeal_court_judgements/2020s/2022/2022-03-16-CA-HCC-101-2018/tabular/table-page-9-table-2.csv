"witness raised a strong doubt as to the guilt of the appellant and the court should have given the"
"benefit of that doubt to the appellant."
"Per Ismail, J."
"""The evidence of Senaratne who was the sole eye witness to the incident is open to suspicion."
"The  trial  Judge  had  failed  to  appreciate  that  his  evidence  regarding  the  identity  of  the"
"appellant has not been supported by any other item of evidence."""
"Glanville Williams The Proof Guilt, 3rd Edition, on pages 158 & 159 illustrates as follows;"
"“on a charge of rape and similar offences, it is the practice to instruct the jury that it is unsafe"
"to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the alleged victim. The rule applies to a charge"
"of  indecent  assault,  or  any  sexual  offences,  including  unnatural  offences  between  males."
"There is a sound reason for it, because these cases are particularly subject to the danger of"
"deliberately false charge, resulting from sexual neurosis, phantasy, jealousy, spite or simply a"
"girl's refusal to admit that she consented to an act of which she is now ashamed.”"
