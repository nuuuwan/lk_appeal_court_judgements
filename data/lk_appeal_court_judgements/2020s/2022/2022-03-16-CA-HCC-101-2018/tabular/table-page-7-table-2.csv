"Coomaraswamy in “Law of Evidence” Vol II Book 2 at page 1052 reads as follows: -"
"""One thing may be regarded as more likely to have happened than another, with the result"
"that the Judge will reject the evidence in favour of the less likely."""
"In the event, the learned High Court Judge should have rejected the version of the prosecution which"
"was less likely to happen. As observed by the Investigating Officer, the Gramasevaka who was at the"

"The learned High Court Judge decided to reject the unreliable evidence. The learned trial Judge could"
"rely on the evidence by separating the credible part of such evidence. The principle of ""Divisibility of"
"Credibility"" is still applicable even in respect of adverse witnesses. The evidence of the Gramasevaka"
"for the most part was not challenged or not proved as false by the prosecution. The prosecution had"
"not marked any contradictions in respect of the said portions of the evidence. In those circumstances,"
"it is my view that such evidence can be considered reliable evidence."
"The  evidence  that  the  father  of  the  accused-appellant  had  informed  the  Gramasevaka  that  the"
"prosecutrix  was  coming  on  the  following  morning  to  obtain  a  certificate  and  the  fact  that  the"
"prosecutrix came with the appellant the following morning to meet the Gramasevaka was not proved"
"by the prosecution as false. The prosecution has failed to create any doubt in respect of the said"
"portions of the evidence."
