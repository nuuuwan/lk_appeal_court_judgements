"Taking  into  consideration,  all  those  circumstances,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  conviction  of  the"
"accused-appellant cannot be allowed to stand as the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond"
"all reasonable doubts."
"The appeal is allowed and the conviction quashed."
"Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment along with the main case record to the High"
"Court of Gampaha and to inform the prison authorities forthwith."
