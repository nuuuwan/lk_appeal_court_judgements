"that the prosecutrix had informed the father of the accused-appellant in advance that she is coming"
"to  obtain  the  said  certificate  and  thereafter  the  accused-appellant  accompanied  her  to  the"
"Gramasevaka’s office."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the accused-appellant took up the position that the prosecutrix"
"and the accused-appellant had an affair even after their divorce and they have had sexual intercourse"
"even  after  their  divorce.  The  Gramasevaka  was  called  by  the  prosecution  as  a  witness.  He  was"
"subsequently considered as an adverse witness. The evidence given by the said Gramasevaka creates"
"a reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the evidence of the prosecutrix. However, the evidence of"
"the Gramasevaka corroborates the defence position despite contradicting the prosecutrix."
"In the case of King v. Fernando 46 NLR 254, it was observed that the fact that a witness is treated as"
"adverse  and  is  cross-examined  as to  credit does  not  warrant  a direction  to  the jury that they  are"
"bound  in  law  to  place  no  reliance  on  his  evidence.  It  is  for  the  jury  to  examine  the  whole  of  the"
"evidence of such a witness so far as it affects both parties favourably or unfavourably for what, in"
"their opinion, it is worth."
"In the said judgment the Indian Supreme Court case Keshoram Bora v. The State of Assam 1978 AIR"
"65-SC-1096,  was  followed  wherein,  it  was  observed  that  ""While  it  is  true  that  merely  because  a"
"witness is declared hostile his evidence cannot be rejected on that ground alone, it is an equally well-"
"settled principle that when once a prosecution witness is declared hostile the prosecution exhibits"
"its intention not to rely on the evidence of such a witness and, hence his version cannot be treated"
"as the version of the prosecution itself""."
"The behaviour of the prosecutrix creates further doubt in respect of her version while strengthening"
"the version of the defence."
