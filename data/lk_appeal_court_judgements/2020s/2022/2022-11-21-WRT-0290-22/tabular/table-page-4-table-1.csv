"The  learned  Magistrate  has  fixed  a  date  thereafter  to  consider  the  permanent  order  for"
"maintenance as such interim order, in terms of the said Act, shall remain operative until"
"an order on the main application is made."
"Such impugned order has been identified by the Petitioner as an order made by the learned"
"Magistrate  resulting  in  an  error  of  law  on  the  face  of  record  (Vide-paragraph  8  of  the"
"Petition). In terms of Section 14(1) of the Act, any person who shall be dissatisfied with"
"any order made by a Magistrate under section 2 or section 11 may prefer an appeal to the"
"relevant High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution in like manner as if"
"the order was a final order pronounced by Magistrateâ€™s Court in a criminal case or matter."
"This shows that the Petitioner has a statutory remedy against the impugned order made"
"by the learned Magistrate under section 11 of the Act."
"However,  the  Petitioner  has  invited  this  Court  to  exercise  the  jurisdiction  vested  under"
"Article 140 of the Constitution to quash the impugned decision of the learned Magistrate."
"It is no doubt that this Court has the full power and authority to grant and issue, according"
"to law, orders in the nature of writs of Certiorari against the judge of any Court of first"
"instance subject to the provisions of the Constitution."
"Moreover,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  discussion  on  the  aspect  whether  the  parties"
"should first exhaust other remedies such as appeal before seeking for judicial review has"
"existed for a long time. Lord Justice Bingham recording his impression that the exhaustion"
"doctrine is more often proclaimed than applied (in a lecture printed in [1991] PL 64 (at"
"72)) has concluded that where unlawful, as opposed to unjustified, treatment is shown, the"
"courts should grant relief regardless of alternative remedies. Notwithstanding the views of"
"Lord Bingham just cited, the judges remain reluctant to allow judicial review when there"
"is  an  alternative  remedy.  But  Wade  and  Forsyth  state  that  the  focus  has  fallen  upon"
"whether the alternative remedy is an adequate alternative. (Vide-Administrative Law by H."
"W. R. Wade and C. F. Forsyth, (11th Edition) Oxford at p. 605)"
"It  seems  that  our  courts  have  been  following  the  principle  that  the  certiorari  being  a"
"discretionary remedy will not ordinarily be granted if the alternative remedy is adequate"
"and efficacious. (for this discussion-Also see Obeysekara vs. Albert and others 1978-79 (2)"
"Sri. L.R. 220 (CA); Somasunderam Vanniasingham vs. Forbes and another 1993 (2) Sri. L.R."
"362 (SC))."
