"as  Lord  Denning  correctly  pointed  out 
in  Director  of  Public"
"Prosecutions v. Head (1959) AC 83, where there are no reasonable"
"grounds for the formation of the authority’s opinion, judicial review"
"in such a case is permissible. Thus, the doctrine of reasonableness"
"may be invoked."
"In  the  case  in  hand,  the  Tea  Commissioner  (4th  Respondent)  has"
"informed the Petitioner (vide P4) that the registration of the Petitioner"
"Company has been suspended with immediate effect. The reasons for"
"such suspension are given in P4 that at the investigation carried out"
"by  the  SLTB  it  was  revealed  that  made  tea  manufactured  at  their"
"factory had exceeded the maximum possible levels of sugar for “black"
"tea” in the mid elevation and accordingly, the factory is in violation of"
"the direction issued by the Tea Commissioner under section 8(2) of"
"the Tea Control Act. The 4th Respondent also informed the Petitioner"
"the  sequence  of  events  related  to  the  sampling  of  theirs  catalogued"
"tea  and  requested  the  Petitioner  to  be  present  for  an  inquiry  on"
"24.07.2020 
to 
state 
his 
case  with 
respect 
to 
the 
alleged"
"contamination. However, the Petitioner by its letter dated 23.07.2020"
"had responded requesting the Respondent to lift the suspension and"
"cancel  the  inquiry.  Moreover,  section  8(2)  of  the  Act  specifically"
"provides that where the Controller is satisfied, after such inquiry as he"
"may  deem  necessary,  he  may  issue  the  direction  specified  in  the"
"section. The section never states after such inquiry as he shall deem"
"necessary.3"
"Hence, as submitted by the learned  Additional Solicitor General for"
"the Respondents that in order to maintain the quality of “Ceylon Tea”"
"and its brand value, it is vital to stop contaminated tea from reaching"
"the  global  market  and 
therefore,  rigorous  measures  should  be"
"3 For example, see section 26 of the Vaccination Act (Act No. V of 1880) of Bangladesh"
