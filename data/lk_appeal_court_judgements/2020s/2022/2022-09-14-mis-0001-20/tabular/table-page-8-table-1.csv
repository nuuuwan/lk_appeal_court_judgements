"point of registration the chassis and engine numbers are physically not"
"tallied but whatever number that appears on the chassis and engine, if"
"it tallies with the importation documents, the vehicle is dully registered."
"Therefore, as the government analyst has detected a tampering of the"
"chassis  and  engine  numbers  the  Magistrate  has  held  that 
it 
is  the"
"subject matter of an offence and as such it has to be forfeited."
"Therefore, in view of the material stated above, the vehicle in question"
"has been imported to Sri Lanka in 1997. The current appellant had been"
"registered  as  the  owner 
in  2007.  Thereafter,  there 
is  no  change  of"
"registration  with  regards  to  ownership.  The  government  analyst  has"
"detected a tampering with regards to the chasse and engine numbers."
"But  the  date  of  the  said  tampering  is  not  known.  The  Motor  Traffic"
"Commissioner  had  not  detected  any 
illegality 
in  the  documentation"
"submitted by the appellant at the time of registration. Therefore, it is a"
"duly registered vehicle in view of the provisions in the Motor Traffic Act."
"But  it  is  very  clear  that  the  chassis  and  engine  numbers  in  the  vehicle"
"has been tampered with, even though as pleaded by the appellant, he"
"has been a bona fide purchaser of the vehicle, the fact that the vehicle"
"has a altered chassis and engine numbers is an offence in terms of the"
"Motor Traffic Act and as such under section 425 of the CPC the subject"
"matter is liable for forfeiture."
"In the case of Manawadu v AG, which is cited above “the owner of the"
"vehicle  has  to  satisfy  the  Court  that  he  had  taken  all  precautions  to"
"avoid any illegal activity”. In the instant case, although the vehicle has"
"not  been  used  for  illegal  activity,  there  had  been  some  illegal  activity"
"committed  on 
the  vehicle  as  per 
the  government  Analyst 
report."
