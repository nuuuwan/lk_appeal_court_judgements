"(2) The mischief if any, under the old law which the Statute sought to remedy"
"and (3) The remedy itself.”"
"Applying the above test to the case at hand, it appears that the Legislature has"
"altered the time frames existed by extending and reducing as it saw fit within"
"which the TAC is expected to arrive at a determination. Therefore, does not"
"appear to me that it had been done to remedy any obvious mischief which"
"existed, other than an alteration of the time granted to the TAC to decide an"
"appeal. On the other hand, one cannot argue that the mischief sought to be"
"remedied was the delay in the appeal process since the 180-day time frame"
"had been extended up to 270 days at first and thereafter, it had been reduced"
"again to run from the commencement of sittings for the hearing. Hence, it is"
"my  considered  view  that  the  intention  of  the  Legislature  in  amending  the"
"above provisions twice was merely to redefine the time granted to the TAC to"
"determine an appeal."
"Furthermore, it is important to note that although the Legislature has amended"
"the relevant provision twice Legislature, in its wisdom has not made the time"
"limit mandatory. If the intention of the Legislature was that the failure of the"
"TAC to adhere to the time limit should result the appeal being abated and the"
"tax is no longer recoverable, as it was submitted by the learned Counsel for"
"the Appellant12, the Legislature could have specifically enacted it to be so."
