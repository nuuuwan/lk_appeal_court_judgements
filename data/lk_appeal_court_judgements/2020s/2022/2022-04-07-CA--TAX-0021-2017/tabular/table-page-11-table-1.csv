"that was deemed to have been transferred to the Commission from the Board"
"of Review under Section 10 of the principal Act, notwithstanding the expiry"
"of twelve months granted for its determination."
"Since the amendment to Section 10 was brought in with retrospective effect,"
"in  any  event, 
the 
twenty-four-month  period  will  apply 
to  all  appeals"
"transferred from the Board of Review. Therefore, the introduction of Section"
"15 of the amendment will not serve any meaningful purpose and appears to"
"be  redundant.  Nevertheless, 
in  my  view,  Section  15  manifests 
that 
the"
"intention of the Legislature, by introducing Amendment Act No. 20 of 2013,"
"is not to make the deadlines mandatory."
"On the other hand, one may  argue that the application of Section 15 of the"
"amendment  is  limited  to  the  proviso  in  Section  10  and  that  therefore,  the"
"Legislature has manifested its intention that the time frame in the proviso to"
"be merely directory, but that which is in the main part to be mandatory. Yet,"
"this cannot be a valid argument since in the circumstances, the Legislature has"
"extended the time frame in the proviso and reduced it in the main part, by the"
"same  Amendment.  When  the  time  frame  is  brought  down,  the  question  of"
"overrunning the existing time frame will not arise, and therefore, a necessity"
"to enact as above will also not arise."
"Therefore, I am not prepared to accept the contention of the learned Counsel"
"for  the  Appellant,  that  the  fact  that  the  Legislature  has  given  retrospective"
"effect 
to 
the  amended  provisions  means 
that 
it 
intended 
the 
time 
limit"
"contained in Section 10 to be mandatory."
"Although fiscal  statutes  generally  require strict  interpretation, N.  S.  Bindra"
"has stated that:17"
"‘The principle that fiscal statutes should be strictly construed does not rule"
"out the application of the principles of reasonable construction to give effect"
"to the purposes or intention of any particular provision as apparent from the"
"scheme of the Act, with the assistance of such external aids as are permissible"
"under the law.’"
