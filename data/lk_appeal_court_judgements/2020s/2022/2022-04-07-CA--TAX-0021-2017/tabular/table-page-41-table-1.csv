"Nevertheless, the following observations made by the Supreme Court of India"
"in the aforementioned judgment (reproduced below) are relevant to the issue"
"at hand:"
"Regarding the definition of the word ‘export’;"
"“The word export may conceivably be used in more senses than one. In one"
"sense, ‘export’ may mean sending or taking out of the country, but in another"
"sense, it may  mean  sending goods  from one  country to another.  Often,  the"
"latter involves a commercial transaction but not necessarily. The country to"
"which the goods are thus sent is said to import them, and the words ‘export’"
"and ‘import’ in this sense are complimentary”"
"In order to explain the above difference, Hidayathulla J., used an illustration"
"where goods ordered by the health authorities to be destroyed by dumping"
"them in the sea, and for that purpose are taken out of the territories, cannot be"
"said to have been exported. On the contrary, if the goods put on board a ship"
"bound for a foreign country but, for some reason dumped in the sea, they can"
"still be said to have been exported, even though they  will not have reached"
"their destination. Therefore, it appears that in both the instances, though the"
"goods  have  been  taken  out  of  the  territory,  the  first  example  does  not"
"constitute an export whereas the second example does."
"Hidayathulla  J.,  explained  the  difference  between  the  two  scenarios  in  the"
"following manner."
"“The difference lies in the fact that whereas the goods, in the first example,"
"had no foreign destination, the goods, in the second example, had. It means"
"therefore, that while all exports involve a taking out of the country, all goods"
"taken out of the country cannot be said to be exported. The test is that the"
"goods must have a foreign destination where they can be said to be imported.”"
"H
owever, as I have already been stated in this judgement, marine bunker fuel,"
"which  is  consumed  by  the  ship  on  its  journey  may  not  reach  a  foreign"
"destination. Yet, in my view, for marine bunker fuel to be treated as having"
"been  exported,  it should be  supplied to  a ship  which is outbound  from Sri"
"Lanka. It is obvious that a ship which leaves the territory of Sri Lanka will"
"not stay in high seas indefinitely. It should reach a foreign port. If the same"
"ship returns to a Sri Lankan port due to some unforeseen or catastrophic event,"
"the supply could still be treated as an export, but not otherwise."
