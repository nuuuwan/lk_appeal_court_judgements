"It is important to note that Section 165(7) itself provides that upon receipt of"
"a valid petition of appeal the CGIR may cause further inquiry to be made by"
"an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner, other than the Assessor or Assistant"
"Commissioner who made the assessment in appeal. Hence, it is clear that the"
"intention of the Legislature in enacting aforementioned provisions in Section"
"208 and 217 are not to curtail the authority of the CGIR causing an Assessor"
"to do any act which is to be done under the Inland Revenue Act."
