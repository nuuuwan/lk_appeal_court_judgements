"Section 10 of the TAC Act, as amended, provides that the TAC shall hear and","","",""
"determine all appeals within 270 days from the date of the commencement of","","",""
"sittings for the hearing of the appeal.","","",""
"The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the time bar starts to run","","",""
"not from the commencement of sittings for the first oral hearing, but from the","","",""

"not an inter-parte hearing.9. His contention was that such a sitting constitutes","","",""
"commencement of sittings for hearing the case and is a trigger for time bar.","","",""
"Be that as it may, the learned Counsel has failed to establish that there had","","",""

"in the instant case. This allows me to proceed on the basis that the first date","","",""
"of oral hearing was on the date stated in the determination.","","",""
"In the case in hand, the determination of the TAC itself states that the date of","","",""
"first hearing was 13th October 2016 and the determination had been made on","","",""
"the 17th August 2017. Hence, it is apparent that the decision has taken more","","",""

"The learned Senior State Counsel did not contest this position and the Court","","",""

"Next, I will proceed to the issue as to whether compliance with the aforesaid","","",""
"time frame is mandatory, or merely directory.","","",""
"On a plain reading of Section 10 it appears that the Legislature has used the","","",""

"However, as the law stands, mere presence of the word “shall” itself does not","","",""
