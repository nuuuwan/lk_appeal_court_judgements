"The  defence  can  challenge  the  chain  of  custody  evidence  by  questioning"
"whether  the  evidence  presented  at  trial  is  the  same  evidence  as  what  was"
"collected from an accused person. If there is any discrepancy in the chain of"
"custody of a production and the prosecution is unable to prove who had the"
"custody  of  production  until  it  reached  the  analyst,  the  chain  of  custody"
"stands broken."
"The Appellant takes up the position that the amount of Heroin which had"
"been  mentioned  in  the  indictment  was  not  recovered  from  him.  The  said"
"amount was recovered from another person and he was implicated in this"
"case  due  to  an  existing  dispute  between  him  and  the  police.  He  had"
"complained to Geneva Human Rights Commission regarding an attempt to"
"shoot him by officers of the Police Narcotic Bureau."
"According  to  PW1,  the  Heroin  recovered  from  the  Appellant  at  his  sister’s"
"place was kept in his custody before he went for the second raid. He admitted"
"that the Heroin recovered from the Appellant was not sealed but was put in"
"to  a  Black  Coloured  Tulip  bag.    Further,  he  admitted  that  he  was  aware,"
"according to C 73 of Police Departmental Orders, that recovered productions"
"should be sealed as soon as possible. But he had not done so, as the team"
"failed to take sealing equipment when they left the Police Narcotic Bureau."
"But he had taken the field test equipment in a Tulip bag. This Tulip bag was"
"used to put the three parcels of Heroin allegedly recovered allegedly from the"
"Appellant."
"PW1, went on to say that the tulip bag which contained the Heroin recovered"
"from the Appellant was given to PW2, when he got down from the Appellant’s"
"vehicle to conduct the second raid."
"After  the  second  raid,  PW1  was  in  possessing  of  the  Heroin  which  was"
"recovered from another person and brought to the Police Narcotic Bureau in"
"the  same  vehicle.  On  both  occasions  the  productions  recovered  from  the"
"Appellant and the other person were not sealed until  it reached the Police"
