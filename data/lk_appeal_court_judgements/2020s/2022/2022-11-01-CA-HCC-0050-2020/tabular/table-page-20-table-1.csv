"Following that, I would further consider the 9th ground of appeal advanced"
"by the Appellant. In the said ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that"
"the  Learned  Trial  Judge  has  misdirected  himself 
in 
examining 
the"
"information book entries challenged by the defence while not providing an"
"opportunity to the defence to have access to the same. Thereby, the Learned"
"Trial Judge had deprived the Appellant of a fair trial."
"The Learned Trial Judge in his judgment at paragraphs 11.0 and 12.0 has"
"stated that he examined the Police Information Book to verify certain issues"
"raised  by  the  defence  with  regards  to  entry  and  exist  time  of  the  police"
"personnel. Despite the fact the Learned High Court Judge indicated that he"
"chose to read the Police Information Book to do the justice to the Appellant,"
"he had strengthened the police evidence without allowing the defence to see"
"the Police Information Book. The relevant portions are re-produced below:"
"(Pages 2382-2383 of the brief.)"
