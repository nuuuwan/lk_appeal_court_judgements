"The  Learned  High  Court 
judge  has  considered 
this  evidence 
in  his"
"judgment.  As  this  evidence  failed  to  create  any  doubt  on  the  prosecution"
"case, I conclude that the second ground of appeal is also sans merit."
"T
he Appellant in his third ground of appeal contends that the Learned Trial"
"Judge has failed to consider the explanation given by the Appellant and the"
"inherent weaknesses in the evidence pertaining to the palm print."
"T
he  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  argued  that  the  fingerprint  and  the  palm"
"print  uplifted  from  the  crime  scene  were  not  proved  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt by the prosecution."
"P
W8, 
IP  Navaratne  had  visited 
the  crime  scene  upon 
receiving 
the"
"complaint from PW1. He had gone to the room where the deceasedâ€™s body"
"was  found  and  has  recorded  his  observations  and  has  engaged  police"
"protection  for  the  crime  scene  until  the  arrival  of  the  officers  to  collect"
"finger  print  evidence.  On  30/03/2004 
two  police  officers  namely  SI"
"Kaluarachchi and PC 17600 Sisira from the Police Fingerprint Department"
"had  arrived  at  the  crime  scene  and  had  extracted  a  fingerprint  from  a"
"dressing table and a palm print from an almirah. Although the fingerprint"
"and  the  palm  print  were  extracted  on  30/03/2004,  the  Appellant  was"
"arrested  on  17/05/2004  about  one  and  a  half  months 
following 
the"
"incident.  Further,  when  the  fingerprint  and  palm  print  were  extracted,"
"there was no any clue received regarding any suspect in connection to this"
"incident.  The  Appellant  was  arrested  upon  further  inquiry  conducted  on"
"phone conversation details."
"A
ccording  to  PW9,  the  Registrar  of  the  Fingerprint  Department  confirmed"
"that  SI  Kaluarachchi  had  extracted  a  fingerprint  and  a  palm  print  on"
"30/05/2004.  As  he  only  received 
the 
fingerprint  of 
the  Appellant  on"
"18/05/2004,  he  had  done  the  comparison  but  the  fingerprint  extracted"
