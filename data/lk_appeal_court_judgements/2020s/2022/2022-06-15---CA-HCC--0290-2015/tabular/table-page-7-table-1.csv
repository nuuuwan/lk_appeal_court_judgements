"In  Premawansha  v.  Attorney  General  [2009]  2  SLR  205  the  Court  of",""
"Appeal held that:",""
"","“In a case of circumstantial evidence if an inference of guilt is to"
"","be  drawn,  such  an 
inference  must  be 
the  one  and  only"
"","irresistible 
and 
inescapable 
conclusion 
that 
the 
accused"
"","committed the offence”."
"I","n  the  case  of  Regina  v.  Exall  and  Others  [1866]  4F.  &  F.  pages  922  at"
"929 the Court held that:",""
"","“It  has  been 
said 
that 
circumstantial 
evidence 
is 
to 
be"
"","considered  as  a  chain,  and  each  piece  of  evidence  as  a  link  in"
"","the chain, but that is not so, for then, if any one link broke, the"
"","chain  would  fall.  It  is  more  like  the  case  of  a  rope  composed  of"
"","several  cords.  One  strand  of  the  cord  might  be  insufficient  to"
"","sustain the weight, but three stranded together may be quite of"
"","sufficient strength."
"","Thus 
it  may  be 
in  circumstantial  evidence—there  may  be  a"
"","combination  of  circumstances,  no  one  of  which  would  raise  a"
"","reasonable  conviction,  or  more  than  a  mere  suspicion;  but  the"
"","whole,  taken  together,  may  create  a  strong  conclusion  of  guilt,"
"","that is, with  as much certainty as human affairs can require or"
"","admit of.”"
"I","n  this  case  in  order  to  find  the  Appellant  guilty  to  the  charge,  all  the"
"circumstances  must  point  at","the  Appellant 
that  he 
is 
the  one  who"
"committed  the  murder  of  the  deceased  and  not  anybody  else.  It  is  the",""
"incumbent duty of the prosecution to prove same beyond reasonable doubt.",""
