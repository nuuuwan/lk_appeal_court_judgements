"I
 
 
n the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned High"
"Court  judge  has  come  to  an  erroneous  finding  based  on  speculations  and"
"surmises."
"T
he Learned High Court Judge in his judgment very extensively considered"
"the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defence  to come to his"
"conclusion.  He  had  not  acted  on  speculations  and  surmises.  Also,  not"
"considered  the  evidence  presented  by  both  sides  erroneously.  Hence  this"
"ground also devoid any merit."
"T
he  Learned  High  Court  Judge  has  considered  this  case  in  keeping  with"
"standards  that  should  have  been  adopted  when  a  case  is  rest  entirely  on"
"circumstantial evidence. His consideration very clearly in keeping with the"
"guidance that have been decided in several judgments which were entirely"
"rested on circumstances evidence. He has analyzed the evidence and given"
"reasons why he accepts the prosecution case."
"F
urther  he  had  considered  the  dock  statement  of  the  Appellant  and  had"
"given plausible reasons as to why he rejects the same. Also had given equal"
"and due consideration to the defence evidence in his judgement."
"A
s  discussed  under  the  appeal  grounds  advanced  by  the  Appellant,  the"
"prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating circumstantial evidence"
"against  the  Appellant.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  had  very  correctly"
"analyzed all the evidence presented by both parties and come to conclusion"
"that  the  all  the  circumstances  are  consistent  only  with  the  hypothesis  of"
"the guilt of the Appellant and totally inconsistent with his innocence."
