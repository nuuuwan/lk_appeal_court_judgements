"may  argue  that  the  Notice  of  Assessment  also  should  be  sent  forthwith,"
"along with the letter of intimation. At a glance it appears that there is some"
"merit in the said argument. Yet, on a careful consideration, it is clear that"
"all  that  should  be  done  is  to  require  such  person  to  pay  forthwith.  The"
"Sinhala text in the official version of the IR Act also reads that ‘න ොපමොව"
"නෙව  නෙස’. On the other hand, the language in Section 163 or 164 does"
"not provide that an assessment is made once the Notice of assessment is"
"issued. All that is provided is that a Notice of Assessment should be given"
"to the Assessee."
"When addressing the question of time bar, it could be seen that the time bar"
"provided in Section 163 (5) applies to the making of an assessment. The"
