"Therefore, the interpretation in the aforesaid document cannot be accepted"
"as an interpretation issued by the Inland Revenue Department."
"The Appellant’s contention was that the Appellant’s business of electrical"
"installation  work 
comes  within 
the 
purview 
of 
‘undertaking 
for"
"construction  work’  as  defined  in  Section  46  (1)  (c)  of  the  IR  Act.  The"
"Respondent rejected the contention of the Appellant and submitted that the"
"Appellant’s  principal  business  activity  of  electrical  installation  does  not"
"come under the purview of ‘undertaking for construction work’ in terms of"
"Section 45 of the IR Act."
"The phrase ‘undertaking for construction work’ is defined in Section 45"
"(2) (c) which is reproduced above to mean an undertaking carried on for"
"the construction of any building, roads or bridges, water supply, drainage"
"or  sewerage  system  or  harbour,  airport  or  any  infrastructure  project  in"
"telecommunication or electricity."
"The  Appellant  contended  construction  of  the  building  is  a  multitasking"
"process  and  most  usually  a  collective  effort  of  different  groups  of"
"professionals 
and 
it 
consists  with 
the  building  or 
assembling  of"
"infrastructure.  It  integrate  the  services  of  surveyors,  architects,  interior"
"designers,  civil  engineers,  mechanical  engineers,  electrical  engineers,"
"higher  protection  engineers  and  constructors 
throughout  design  and"
"construction life cycle of the building in order to ensure a positive outcome"
"with  safe,  comfortable  and  environmentally 
friendly  operation  of  a"
"building 
(sic).53 
I  do  concede 
that  construction  of  a  building 
is  a"
"multitasking  process,  usually  a  collective  effort  of  different 
types  of"
"assembling  infrastructure.  It  includes  building  the  structure,  electrical"
"installations, water supply, drainage, or sewerage system etc.  Admittedly,"
"the principal activity of the Appellant company is carrying out the business"
"of electrical installation work. It is true that the definition ‘undertaking for"
"construction  work’  has  an  extensive  meaning  and  the  construction  of  a"
"building  is  a  multitasking  process  which  involves  collective  effort  of"
"different groups. Yet, the  exemption under the IR Act is granted for the"
"profits and income of the company’s ‘undertaking for construction work’."
"The  term  ‘undertaking  for  construction  work’  is  defined  to  include  the"
"construction  of 
any  building.  Admittedly, 
the  undertaking 
for 
the"
"construction  of  the  building  is  not  carried  on  by  the  Appellant.  The"
"Appellant  only  carries  out  the  electrical  installation  work  of  the  said"
