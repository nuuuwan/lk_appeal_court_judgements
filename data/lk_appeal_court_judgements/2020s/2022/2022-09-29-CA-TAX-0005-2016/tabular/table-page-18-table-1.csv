"The Court arrived at the above conclusion on the footing that the duty to"
"assess is coupled with the duty to serve notice in  writing and if not, the"
"Assessor  will  be  able  to  make  an  assessment  even  after  the  stipulated"
"period and send the Notice of Assessment to the Assessee. Further, if the"
"Assessee takes the position that the assessment was not made within the"
"prescribed  time,  the  Assessor  will  be  free  to  produce  a  document  made"
"after the prescribed time but, incorrectly bears a date within the prescribed"
"time, as evidence of making the assessment23. However, in the instant case"
"the  facts  are  different.  The  Assessor  having  made  the  assessment  has"
"communicated  it  to  the  Appellant  in  the  letter  of  intimation  dated  28th"
"November 2011. The identical figures of taxable income and the total tax"
"payable  appearing in the letter of intimation24  are  there  in the  Notice of"
"Assessment25 as well."
"Therefore, in anyway the Assessor in the present case has no opportunity"
"to introduce a pre-dated assessment subsequently. Therefore, expressing a"
"fear of introducing a false assessment in the case in hand would only be a"
"surmise."
"The finding of this Court that the Assessor, under Section 163 (3) (b), is"
"entitled to make an assessment in his judgement and to postpone making"
"of the ‘final assessment’ later should never be an opportunity given to the"
"Assessor to make an arbitrary assessment. The Assessor, though acts in his"
"own  judgement,  is  expected  to  exercise  his  judgement  according  to  the"
"principles of justice."
"In  the  case  of  A.  M.  Ismail  v.  Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue26  His"
"Lordship  Victor  Perera  J.,  dealing  with  the  intention  of  the  Legislature"
"regarding the requirement of communicating reasons for the rejection of a"
"return,  introduced  to  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  No.  4  of  1963  by  Inland"
"Revenue (amendment) law No. 30 of 1978 stated as follows;"
"‘The amending  law  clearly  contemplated  that  the notice  communicating"
"the reasons for not accepting of a return should be an exercise before the"
"actual assessment of income, wealth or gifts is made for the purpose of"
"sending the statutory Notice of Assessment referred to in Section 95.’"
"It was also started that;"
