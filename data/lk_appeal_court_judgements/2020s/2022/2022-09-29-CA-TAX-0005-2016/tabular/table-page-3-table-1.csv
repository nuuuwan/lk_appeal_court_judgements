"Accordingly, the ten questions of law to be answered by this Court are as"
"follows;"
"1.  Did  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  err  in  law  when  it  failed  to"
"appreciate that no assessment or additional assessment had been"
"issued by the Department of Inland Revenue until the purported"
"Assessment No. ITA1203190088 V1 was sent which is admittedly"
"after a two (2) years period within the meaning of section 165 (3)"
"of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 and therefore out of time"
"and thus a nullity?"
