"the indication of its compliance. The new procedure would also have the"
"effect of fixing the Assessor to a definite position and not give him latitude"
"to chop and change thereafter. It was therefore essential that an Assessor"
"who rejects a return should state his reasons and communicate them. His"
"reasons  must  be  communicated  at  or  about 
the 
time  he  sends  his"
"assessment  on  an  estimated  income.  Any  later  communication  would"
"defeat the remedial action intended by the amendment4.’ (Emphasis added)"
"Accordingly,  the  Appellant  argued  that  in  light  of  the  aforementioned"
"observations made by His Lordship Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon, if a"
"return is rejected, the same Assessor must give the reasons for the rejection,"
"communicate  them  to  the  Assessee,  make  the  assessment  and  issue  the"
"Notice of Assessment. Consequently, the Appellant submitted that in the"
"case  at  hand  the  assessment  has  been  rejected  by  the  Assessor,  Mr."
"M.M.R.R.  Mellawa 
and 
the  Deputy  Commissioner,  Ms.  Manjula"
"Gunathunga, and the Notice of Assessment has been issued by Assessor"
"Mr.  M.L.J.G.  Chandrasiri  and  all  actions 
taken  after 
the  Notice  of"
"Assessment has been issued are null and void in law and should therefore"
"be rescinded."
"T
he Appellant's argument above is based on the fact that the Assessor who"
"signed the intimation letter is not the Assessor who signed the Notice of"
"Assessment. The  Appellant's argument was  founded on  the  words,  ‘(…)"
"where  an  Assessor  (…)  does  not  accept  a  return  (…)  and  makes  an"
"assessment (…), he shall communicate (…) his reasons for not accepting"
"the  return’,  in  the  proviso  of  Section  163  (3)  of  the  IR  Act.  However,"
"Section 163 (3) does not specify that the Notice of Assessment should be"
"issued by the same Assessor who made the assessment. All that is set out"
"in  the  proviso  of  Section  163  (3)  is  that  the  Assessor  who  makes  the"
"assessment should communicate the tax payer in writing his reasons for not"
"accepting the return."
"T
he requirement of issuing a Notice of Assessment is specified in Section"
"164 of the IR Act. However, Section 164 also does not require the Assessor"
"who made the assessment and communicated the reasons for not accepting"
"the return to issue the Notice of Assessment."
