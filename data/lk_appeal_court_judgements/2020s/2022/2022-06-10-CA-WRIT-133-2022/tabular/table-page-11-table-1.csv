"be  interpreted  by  taking  into  consideration  the  actual  intention  of  the  legislature  which"
"reflects in the relevant Statute passed by the Parliament. It is important to note that the"
"words; “notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other law” are not found in the"
"said Circular ‘P3’ and therefore, in any event, no provision in the said Circular is intended"
"to amend any other statutory provision of an Act of Parliament."
"In Halwan and others vs. Rahaman and others (1993) 1 Sri. L.R. 201 (at p.212), Ananda"
"Grero J. has held that when there is a conflict between the provisions of a Statute and the"
"provisions of a regulation published in a Gazette, the former prevails over the latter."
"The  said  section  23A  of  the  Act  clearly  envisages  that  the  voluntary  retirement  age  of"
"employees other than the teachers is 55 years and extension of service for a period of one"
"year  at  a  time  can  be  granted  until  such  employee  completes  his/her  60th  year.  It  is"
"pertinent to note that no valid law has been passed by Parliament up to date overriding"
"the said provisions of section 23A."

"Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978, shall not apply to or in relation to the Buddhist and Pali"
"University of Sri Lanka."
"Similarly,  the  latest  Circular  marked  ‘P3’  and  the  Circular  marked  ‘P7’,  simply  cannot"
"override  the  statutory  provisions  of  the  said  Act.  In  the  circumstances,  I  hold  that  any"
"decision of the University not to adopt the said Circular ‘P3’ in relation to the employees"
"who come under the said section 23A, in order to determine their retirement age, is lawful."
"No mandamus can be issued against any authority compelling such authority to override"
"a  statutory  provision  without  an  expressed  intention  of  the  Parliament.  In  terms  of  the"
"Article 4(a) of the Constitution of the Republic the legislative power of the People shall be"
"exercised by the Parliament and by the People at a Referendum and therefore, I take the"
"view that no mandamus can be issued against the Respondents as prayed for in the prayer"
