"In a nutshell, the Petitioners in view of their abovementioned pre-determination, should"
"have straight away sought the indulgence of the fundamental rights jurisdiction subject to"
"the  rules  of  Court  by  way  of  filing  an  application  in  the  Supreme  Court.  It  is  not"
"reasonable, in my view, to use the provisions of the said Article 126(3) merely to overcome"
"issues on time bar etc. and other governing rules in filling a fundamental rights application."
"The Petitioners have not given reasons or an excuse as to why they have sought mandates"
"in the nature of writs of Mandamus and a writ of Certiorari from this Court when they"
"have  pre-determined  that  the  Respondents  have  violated  the  Fundamental  rights  of  the"
"Petitioners."
"The learned Counsel for the Petitioners relies upon the judgement in W. K. C. Perera vs."
"Prof. Daya Edirisinghe (1995) 1 Sri. L.R. 148 and moves that this application be referred"
"to Supreme Court under Article 126(3) of the Constitution. On a careful perusal of the said"
"judgement, it appears that the Petitioner of the said case have lodged an appeal against the"
"order of the Court of Appeal dismissing an application for Certiorari and Mandamus and"
"nowhere in the said judgement does it envisage that an application has been made in the"
"Court of Appeal by the respective Petitioner under Article 126(3)."
"The rationale behind Article 126(3) of the Constitution is that the Court of Appeal will be"
"compelled to refer a writ application to Supreme Court, if it appears to the Court of Appeal"
"in  the  course  of  hearing  before  such  Court  that  there  is  prima  facie  evidence  of  an"
"infringement or imminent infringement of provisions of Chapter III or Chapter IV (of the"
"Constitution) by a party to such application."
"Therefore, it is imperative that the Court of Appeal on its own motion or on an application"
"by a party to a writ application, first should form an opinion satisfying that there is prima"
"facie  evidence  of  an  infringement  of  fundamental  rights  or  language  rights  during  the"
"course  of  the  hearing.  In  other  words,  a  Petitioner  in  a  writ  application  who  has  pre-"
"determined such infringement of fundamental rights or language rights should not be able"
"to  make  an  application  under  Article  126(3)  at  the  threshold  stage  of the  case. It  is  the"
"bounden  duty  of  litigants  to  identify  their  own  grievance  when  selecting  the  forum  to"
"which  he  or  she  should  recourse  to.  Anyhow,  there  cannot  be  any  restriction  for  an"
"applicant for a writ to plead in the prayer of the Petition, to refer such matter to Supreme"
"Court  on  the  grounds  that  if  the  Court  is  satisfied  during  the  hearing  that  there  is  an"
"infringement of fundamental rights or language rights. In the circumstances, I am of the"
