"unreliable  witness,  I  have  no  reasons  to  agree.    The  fact  that  he  was  also"
"initially  arrested  along  with  the  appellant  is  not  a  reason  to  consider  him"
"unreliable.  I  find  that  the  appellant's  admission  under  oath  that  he  met  the"
"deceased  in  Kurunegala  on  the  22nd  of  April  1992,  perfectly  tallies  with  the"
"evidence of Rohana that it was he who arranged the meeting between the two"
"at  the  instigation  of  the  appellant.  Although  the  brother  of  the  deceased  has"
"stated  in  his  evidence  that  he  saw  his  sister  leaving  the  house  around  10.00"
"and 11.00 am on that day, he may be wrong as to the time. However, the fact"
"remains that she left the house on that morning in order to meet the appellant"
"and they were seen together in the afternoon by PW-11."
"I find no basis for the argument that the time gap between 22nd of April where"
"the  deceased  was  last  seen  and  the  discovery  of  her  body  on  the  27th  of  April"

"the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) establishes the fact that the deceased would"
"have received the injuries to her head, which resulted in her death very close to"
"the day on which the deceased was seen in the company of the deceased."
"I find no merit in the argument that the learned High Court Judge has failed to"
"place all the material before the jury and was misdirected as to the facts in his"
"summing up to the jury."
"It  is  the  duty  of  a  High  Court  Judge  in  his  summing  up  to  a  jury,  who  are  a"
"group  of  laymen,  to  explain  in  plain  and  simple  language  the  legal  principles"
"that they should consider and place the available evidence before them. I find"
"that the learned High Court Judge has done just that. I am unable to find any"
"failure in placing material evidence before the jury as contended. Although the"
"last seen theory has not been put forward by the learned High Court Judge to"
"the jury in its strict sense, that does not mean that he was misdirected as he"
"has placed the evidence in that regard before the jury allowing them to decide. I"
