"A  jury  coming  to  a  decision  within  a  short  span  of  time  is  not  a  reason  to"
"conclude  that  they  did  not  deliberate  sufficiently  as  argued  by  the  learned"
"Counsel for the appellant. What is necessary is to come to a correct finding and"
"reaching  the  right  verdict,  which  I  find  the  jury  has  correctly  reached  in  this"
"action."
"For the reasons aforesaid, I find no merit in the grounds of appeal urged. The"
"appeal therefore is dismissed. The conviction and the sentence affirmed."
