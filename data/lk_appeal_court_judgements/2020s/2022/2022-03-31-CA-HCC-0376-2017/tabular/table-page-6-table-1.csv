"Dr A.B. Senaviratne (PW-27) was the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer (JMO)"
"who held the postmortem on the body of the deceased. He has observed several"
"fractures  towards  the  right  side  of  the  temple  of  the  deceased  which  has"
"extended  towards  the  nose  and  the  upper  lip  area.  He  has  opined  that  this"
"injury  was  the  main  reason 
for  the  death  and  has  clearly  ruled  out  the"
"possibility  of  any  animal  bite  or  fall  as  the  cause  of  this  injury.  It  was  his"
"opinion that this injury was a result of a blunt penetrating trauma. Apart from"
"the  above-mentioned  injury,  the  JMO  has  observed  several  broken  vertebrae"
"among other injuries, which the JMO has attributed to either a result of a fall,"
"accident or an assault. Given the fact that the body of the deceased was found"
"in a partially decayed state and in precipice about 100 feet below the road, the"
"JMO’s opinions as to the injuries are well explained by the other evidence."
"When  called 
for  a  defence  at  the  conclusion  of  the  prosecution  case,  the"
"appellant has chosen to give evidence under oath."
"It  was  his  stand  that  he  came  to  know  Fransis  Senaviratne  who  was  the"
"brother of the deceased Disna Priyangani in the year of 1986, while serving at"
"the  Welikanda  police.  It  was  his  evidence  that  he  came  to  know  that  Disna"
"Priyangani  along  with  one  Elisabath  Perera  and  Kalyanawathi  ran  a  business"
"of foreign employment and he too paid a sum of Rs. 65000/- to the deceased in"
"order to secure foreign employment. It was his position that since she could not"
"secure his foreign employment as agreed, she returned a sum of Rs. 28507/56"
"by  post  while  employed  overseas.  He  has  admitted  that  at  the  time  of  the"
"incident  he  was  attached  to  the  police  kennels  situated  in  Wehera  and  was"
"married  to  one  Ajanatha  Ediriweera,  who  was  not  the  deceased.  He  has"
"contracted that marriage on 17-01-1990 and had a child out of that wedlock."
"Explaining his not taking meals from the police mess on 22-04-1992, it was his"
"explanation  that  as  a  married  officer  he  was  not  obliged  to  stay  in  the  single"
"officers’ mess and he obtained his meals from outside."
