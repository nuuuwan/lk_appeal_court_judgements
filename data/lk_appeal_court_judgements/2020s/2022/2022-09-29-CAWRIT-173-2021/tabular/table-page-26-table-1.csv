"act  of  personal  vengeance.  Insinuations  have  been  made  that  the  petitioner  had  unreasonably"
"objected to bail being granted to Mr. Nissanka Senadhipathi."
"Reference was also made to his presence within the precincts of the Bribery Commission (CIABOC)."
"The petitioner did not appear in some of the cases which the Report of the 1st to the 3rd respondents"
"refer  to  in  the  narrative  against  the  petitioner.    However,  these  actions  though  sought  to  be"
"portrayed as malicious, were sanctioned by and done with the awareness of the Attorney General."
"To impute personal liability to the petitioner, for conduct which was demonstrably authorized by the"
"Chief Law Officer of the State, evinces a malicious design by the Commission of Inquiry to harass and"
"victimize an officer of the Attorney General's Department for merely doing what the law required of"
"him to do."
"The Commission of Inquiry has recommended inter alia that the petitioner be indicted for fabricating"
"evidence. This would have devastating consequences for him. There is no material to support the"
"allegation that the petitioner acted improperly and abused his power. Such recommendations, made"
"without any justification whatsoever, will have grave ramifications for the public service."
"The preamble of the Extraordinary Gazette 2157/44 states in reference to the alleged harassment of"
"public officers of the 2015 Government that “the alleged process of political victimization has created"
"a substantial negative impact on the performance of public officers and as a result, such officers have"
"shown and show reluctance to take decisions while discharging their duties and prefer to adopt a"
"passive approach towards work.”"
"In the letter addressed by the Attorney General to the Commission of Inquiry Hon. Attorney General"
"has observed that the petitioner has been named as a ""Respondent"", purportedly in terms of Section"
"16 of the Commission of Inquiry Act. The Attorney General has stated that the said Section does not"
"refer to a ""Respondent"". The said Section refers to ""every person whose conduct is the subject of"
"inquiry under this Act, or who is in any way implicated or concerned in the matter under inquiry""."
"The Attorney General notes that, though the summons arises from a complaint made by Mr. Nissanka"
"Senadhipathi, the complaint nor the allegations made by the former has not been communicated to"
"the  petitioner.  Thus,  the  basis  on  which  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  considered  the  petitioner  ""a"
"person whose conduct is the subject of inquiry"" or how he would be considered ""a person whose"
"conduct is the subject of inquiry"" was not conveyed to the petitioner."
"The learned President’s Counsel who appeared on behalf of the 6th to 9th respondents submits that"
"the  Commission  of  Inquiry  was  vested  with  a  specific  and  clear  mandate  by  His  Excellency  the"
"President. The complaint made by Mr. Nissanka Senadhipathi was not one which the Commission"
"was authorized to inquire into. By proceeding to examine and make adverse recommendations on"
"Mr. Nissanka Senadhipathi's complaint, the Commission has not only acted ultra vires, but it has also"
"displayed its lack of impartiality and independence and exhibited the malice it harbored towards the"
"petitioner. A literal, purposive and practical construction of the mandate of the Commission will lead"
"to  the  inevitable  conclusion  that  the  actions,  functions  and  conduct  of  the  Attorney  General  and"
"every person acting under the authority of the Attorney General could not be inquired into by the"
"Commission."
