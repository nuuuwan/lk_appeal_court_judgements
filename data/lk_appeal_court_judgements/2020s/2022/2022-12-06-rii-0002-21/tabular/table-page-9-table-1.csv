"This Section was analysed in the case of Mohamed Iqbal v. Mohamed Sally [1995]"
"2 SLR 310. His Lordship Ranaraja J. (with his Lordship S.N. Silva J. (as he then was)"
"agreeing) observed thus:"
"“
Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code permits Court on its own motion or on an"
"application by any of the parties to an action;"
"(
1
)
 
to correct any clerical or arithmetical mistake in any judgment or order,"
"(
2
)
 
to correct any error arising in any judgment or order from any accidental slip or omission,"
"(
3
)
 to make any amendment which is necessary to bring a decree into conformity with the"
"j
udgment."
"Section 189 is exhaustive of the causes for which a decree may be amended.”"
"We  are  of  the  view  that  the  learned  Judges  of  the  District  Court  and  the  Civil"
"Appellate Court were correct in their views that the type of ‘mistake’ that is sought to be"
"rectified in the present application is not one falling within the ambit of Section 189. It"
"appears to be conscious and deliberate. A matter such as the redistribution of the shares,"
"which arises now with the inclusion of two new Lots (and as explained below an exclusion"
"of one Lot i.e. Lot “J” from the corpus) unlike, for example, an arithmetic mistake in the"
"share  allocation,  cannot  be  treated  as  falling  within  one  of  the  three  limbs  set  out  in"
"Mohamed Iqbal (supra). We cannot stretch the parameters of Section 189 to include the"
"present mistake within its ambit, even if there appears to be an injustice,  and thereby"
"cause ambiguity in this area of law, when there are clear avenues that can be taken such"
"as an application for revision to revise the judgment of the learned Trial Judge dated 3rd"
"July 2008 and the consequent orders thereon."
"Further, the Plaintiff has not prayed for the setting aside of the judgment dated"
"3rd July 2008  (“P7”),  instead, the  prayers,  as  set  out  above,  deal  with  setting  aside  the"
"Orders  concerning  the  application  under  Section  189  and  for  the  matter  to  be  reheard"
"afresh so that the District Judge can re-determine whether the mistake falls within the"
"sphere of Section 189. Even in his leave to appeal Petition to the Civil Appellate Court (on"
"page 10 of the Brief) there was no prayer to set aside the judgment dated 3rd July 2008."
"There too it was only to set aside the Order dated 9th January 2019 of the District Court."
