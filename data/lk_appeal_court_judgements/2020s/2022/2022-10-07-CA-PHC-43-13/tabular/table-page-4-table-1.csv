"I
n his order dated 28.03.2013, the learned High Court Judge stated that the service was terminated"
"after  an  inquiry  where  he  was  found  guilty  of  charges.  The  Appellant  had  reached  out  to  the"
"Governor of the Uva Provincial in 2006."
"T
hat appeal was rejected by the Governor in the year 2006. Until 2010 the Appellant had been"
"reading out to various persons who were not competent to reverse the decision."
"T
herefore, the delay cannot be considered reasonable. The Appellant argued that a delay of four"
"years can be considered and should be considered. The delay will be considered according to the"
"circumstances from case to case."
"T
he Appellant must show cause for delay, which should be reasonable reasons that a court of law"
"can concede. As the learned High Court Judge points out, running from one post to the other where"
"there would be no remedy cannot be considered reasonable to come to Court."
"T
he learned High Court Judge had pointed out that the Appellant had not explained to the Court"
"why grounds which can be considered unreasonable in finding his guilt had not been shown to"
"Court."
"T
he  Appellant  argued  that  as  he  had  explained  the  delay,  his  application  should  have  been"
"considered mere mentioning reasons are not reasons that a court can consider."
"T
herefore, the reasons were given by the learned High Court Judge stand firm. I see no reason to"
"disturb Even the second ground of which the learned High Court Judge discussed that reasons had"
"not been given as to the finding of guilt is unreasonable is good in law."
"A
 person who comes before Court must come with clean hands."
