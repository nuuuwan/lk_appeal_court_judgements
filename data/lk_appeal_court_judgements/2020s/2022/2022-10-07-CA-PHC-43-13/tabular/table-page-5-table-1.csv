he  document  marked  as  ""P8""  was  issued  by  the  Principal  of  B/Soranathota  Madya  Maha"
"Vidyalaya issued a letter that the Appellant studied in Grad 6 in 1972. The date of leaving school"
"is 1973, and the reason is being absent from school. It was the duty of the Appellant to show that"
"he had studied in a manner acceptable to the inquiring officers."
"T

"educational qualifications, his application could have been considered."
