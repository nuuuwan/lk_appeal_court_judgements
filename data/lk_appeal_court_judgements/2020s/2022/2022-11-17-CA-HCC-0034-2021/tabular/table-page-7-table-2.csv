"as  suitable  directions  in  the  Crown  Court  Bench  Book,"
"March 2010, page 367."
"“Children  do  not  have  the  same  life  experience"
"as  adults.  They  do  not  have  the  same  standards  of"
"logic and consistency, and their understanding may be"
"severely limited for a number of reasons, such as their"
"age and immaturity. Life viewed through the eyes and"
"mind  of  a  child  may  seem  very  different 
from 
life"
"viewed 
by 
an 
adult. 
Children  may 
not 
fully"
"understand  what  it  is  they  are  describing,  and  they"
"may  not  have  the  words  to  describe 
it.  They  may,"
"however,  have  come 
to  realise 
that  what 
they  are"
"describing 
is,  by  adult  standards,  bad  or, 
in 
their"
"perception, naughty. They may be embarrassed  about"
"it, and about using words they think are naughty, and"
"therefore find it difficult to speak…”"
