"In Roberts v. Hopwood [1925] AC 578 Lord Wrenbury, at page 613"
"observed that,"
"A  person 
in  whom  is  vested  a  discretion  must  exercise  his"
"discretion  upon 
reasonable  grounds.  A  discretion  does  not"
"empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded"
"to do so â€“ he must in the exercise of his discretion do not what he"
"likes but what he ought. In other words, he must, by use of his"
"reason, ascertain and follow the course which reason directs. He"
"must act reasonably."
