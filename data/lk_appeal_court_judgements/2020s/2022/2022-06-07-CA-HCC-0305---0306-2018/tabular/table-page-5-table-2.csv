"11. In case of Sarwan Singh V. State of Punjab [2002] INSC 431",""
"","(7 October 2002), Indian Supreme Court held; “… It is a rule"
"","of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to"
"","avail  himself  of 
the  opportunity 
to  put  his  case 
in  cross-"
"","examination it must follow that the evidence tendered on that"

"1","2. In case of state of Himachal Pradesh V. Thakur Dass [1983]"
"","Cri  LJ  1694  it  was  held;  “…  Whenever  a  statement  of  fact"
"","made  by  a  witness  is  not  challenged  in  cross-examination,  it"
"","has to be concluded that the fact in question is not disputed.”"
"1","3. Hence, the evidence that the dying declarations were made by"
"","the deceased to the PW1 and PW2, and that the deceased may"
"","have  been  in  a  position  to  talk  at  the  time  such  declarations"
"","were  made,  can  be  taken  as  admitted  by  the  defence  as  they"
"","were  unchallenged.  Thus,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has"
"","correctly  acted  upon 
the  dying  declarations  made  by 
the"
"","deceased to PW1 and PW2."

for 
the  appellant  submitted 
that 
the"
"","identification  of  the  appellants  by  PW1  from  the  dock  at  the"
"","trial was illegal as the prosecutor has put a leading question in"
"","identifying the appellants. The Counsel referred to the leading"
"","question  posed 
to 
the  witness  at  page  139  of 
the  brief."
"","However,  as  rightly  submitted  in  reply  by  the  learned  DSG,"
"","PW1 has clearly identified the 1st  and 2nd appellants as Chuti"
"","and Sanjeewa as persons who were well known to her (pages"
"","135 and 136 of the appeal brief). It is clear that it was in that"
"","context 
the  said  question  was  put 
to 
the  witness  by 
the"
"","prosecuting  Counsel.  Hence, 
I 
find 
that  PW1  has  clearly"
"","identified 
the  appellants 
to  be 
the  persons 
the  deceased"
"","referred to in his  dying declaration, and that no prejudice has"
"","been caused to the appellants by the said questions put to the"
"","witness  by  the  learned  State  Counsel.  Further,  PW2  has  also"
