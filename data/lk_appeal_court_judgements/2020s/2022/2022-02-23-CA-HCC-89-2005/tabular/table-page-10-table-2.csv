"Inspector Dayananda (PW 1) could not even tell the trial court where the accused-appellant"
"was  arrested.  He  couldn’t  give  any  reasonable  explanation  why  Indrani's  house  was  not"
"searched during  the raid.  Since  the learned President’s counsel has  demonstrated  that  no"
"answer was given by Inspector Dayananda (PW 1) to the suggestion made by the defence,"
"that heroin was introduced by the officers of the Narcotic Bureau, to the accused-appellant,"
"it created a doubt on the prosecution case."
"It is interesting to note that the yardstick the learned High Court Judge applied weighed the"
"credibility of the prosecution witnesses. The trial judge explained that the defence counsel"
"failed  to  mark  a  single  contradiction.  This  same  yardstick  was  not  applied  to  weigh  the"
"evidence of the defence case."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  concluded  on  page  282  of  the  appeal  brief  (page  38  of  the"
"judgement) that the prosecution has proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt. This was"
"before considering the evidence of the accused-appellant. The trial Judge has analysed the"
"evidence of the defence from page 285 of the appeal brief (page 41 of the judgement). The"
"judgement  reflects  how  the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  came  to  the  conclusion  before"
"considering and analysing the defence case.  This procedure is unexpectable and I believe that"
"the  trial 
judge  misdirected  himself  by  convicting  the  accused-appellant  before  he  had"
"analysed the defence case.  Further, this court finds  that  there is  no sufficient evidence or"
"credible evidence to establish that the accused-appellant had in possession of 4.64 grams of"
"heroin on 16.03.2000."
"The learned President’s Counsel for the accused-appellant argued that the explanation given"
"by the accused-appellant had not been considered by the learned High Court Judge. It reflects"
"very clearly on pages 206, 214 and 286 of the appeal brief. The learned High Court Judge had"
"misdirected himself on the question that has to be decided by the Court on the argument of"
"the  defence  whether  the  accused-appellant  was  arrested  by  the  officers  of  the  Narcotic"
"Bureau whilst in possession of 4.64 grams of heroin during the raid on 16.03.2000."
