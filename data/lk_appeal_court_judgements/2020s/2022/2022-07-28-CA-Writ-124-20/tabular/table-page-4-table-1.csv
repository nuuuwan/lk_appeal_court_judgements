"MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J."
"The Petitioners are seeking a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari"
"to quash the decision of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents, promoting the"
"4th to 34th Respondents to the post of ‘Senior Youth Services Officer’. We"
"heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioners in support of this application."
"The  Petitioners  and  4th  to  34th  Respondents  are  employees  of  the  1st"
"Respondent, National Youth Services Council. The 2nd Respondent is the"
"Director and the 3rd Respondent is the Director-Administration of the 1st"
"Respondent  Council.  On  11-10-2016, 
the  2nd  Respondent  called 
for"
"applications 
for  the  post  of 
‘Senior  Youth  Services  Officer’ 
(P4).  The"
"Petitioners  and  4th  to  34th  Respondents  applied  for  the  said  posts  and"
"thereafter,  duly  attended  the  interviews  as  well.  Thereupon,  on  20-08-"
"2018, only the 4th to 34th Respondents were promoted to the post of ‘Senior"
"Youth Services Officer’."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioners  contents  that,  at  the  interview,"
"marks should be given in terms of the scheme of recruitment marked P6,"
"which reads thus;"
"Relevant additional experience.………………………………….30 marks."
"Relevant additional qualifications……………………………….30 marks."
"Additional skills and performance………………..……….…….30 marks."
"Skills demonstrated at the interview……………………….…...30 marks."
"The 
learned  Counsel 
for  the  Petitioners  alleges  that  the  2nd  and  3rd"
"Respondents, 
only 
for 
the  purpose 
of  promoting 
the  4th 
to  34th"
"Respondents, had introduced new educational and other qualifications for"
"the criteria of the selection for the promotion to the said posts, which is"
"illegal, ultra-vires and contrary to the scheme of recruitment marked P6."
"At  first,  it  appears  to  this  Court  that  there  is  a  delay  and  laches  on  the"
"part of the Petitioners in invoking the Writ jurisdiction of this Court. A Writ"
"of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot be held to"
"be a Writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. Even if the Petitioners"
"are entitled to relief, still the Court has the discretion to deny them relief"
"having regard to their conduct: delay, laches, waiver, and submission to"
"jurisdiction are all valid impediments that stand against the grant of relief."
"The Apex Court of India in K.V. Raja Lakshmiah v. State of Mysore (AIR"
"1967 SC. 973), held that,"
