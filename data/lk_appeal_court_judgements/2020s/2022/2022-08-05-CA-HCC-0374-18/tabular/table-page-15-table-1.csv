"such an unconscionable lapse of time, I therefore, set aside the convictions"
"and acquit the accused.‚Äù"
"This  is  an  incident  that  has  happened  nineteen  years  ago  on  25th  December"
"2003. The appellant has been a nineteen-year-old at that time and almost all of"
"the witnesses have been teenagers. At the trial, none of the three injured have"
"given evidence as they have left the country. If a retrial is ordered the evidence"
"of  PW-09  will  be  of  no  value  due  to  the  fact  of  he  been  treated  as  an  adverse"
"witness. There is no guarantee that even the remaining witnesses are available"
"to give evidence in a new trail. The evidence of PW-14, if called again, will be of"
"questionable  nature  due  to  what  he  has  stated  at  the  Magistrate  Court  Non-"
"summary inquiry. The recovery of a gun from the custody of the father-in-law"
"of the appellant, and the evidence of the Government Analyst will not connect"
"the  appellant  to  the  crime  as  the  evidence  led  in  that  regard  shows.  The"
"appellant has been in remand custody for over three and half years before he"
"was convicted and in incarceration for three years and eight months as a result"
"of this appeal. If a retrial is to be ordered, it will be due to no fault on his part."
"Having  taken  into  consideration  all  the  attendant  circumstances,  I  am  of  the"
"view that this is not a fit and proper case to order a retrial."
"Therefore, I acquit the appellant from the charges preferred against him."
"In  view  of  the  acquittal  of  the  appellant  of  the  charges,  consideration  of  the"
"fourth ground of appeal will not arise."
"Appeal allowed."
