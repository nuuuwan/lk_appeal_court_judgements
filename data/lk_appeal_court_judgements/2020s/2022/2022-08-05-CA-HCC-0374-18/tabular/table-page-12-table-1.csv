"168, it was held that:"
"There is no burden whatsoever on an accused who puts forward a plea of"
"alibi  and  the  burden  is  always  on  the  prosecution  to  establish  beyond"
"reasonable doubt that the accused was not elsewhere but present at the"
"time of the commission of the criminal offence."
"E.R.S.R.  Coomaraswamy  in  his  book  The  Law  of  Evidence-  Volume  01  at"
"page 278, discusses the defence of alibi with reference to the relevant case law."
"At page 279 it has been stated that;"
"“An  alibi  is  not  an  exception  to  penal  liability  like  the  general  exceptions"
"and special exceptions laid down in the Penal Code. When the defence of"
"alibi  is  taken,  there  in  no  burden  of  proof  on  the  accused.  The  defence"
"evidence  on  alibi  has  merely 
to  be  weighed

"prosecution evidence. If the evidence of alibi is not believed, it fails. If it is"
"believed, 
it  succeeds.  But 
if 
it 
is  neither  believed  nor  disbelieved  but"
"creates  a  reasonable  doubt  as  to  the  prosecution  case  on  identity,  the"
"accused is entitled to be acquitted.” (See- Pollock C.B. in Rex Vs. Muller"

"I am of the view that the judgment of the learned High Court Judge cannot be"
"allowed to stand on the considered ground of appeal as well."
"I find that at the commencement of this trial, evidence has been led in order to"
