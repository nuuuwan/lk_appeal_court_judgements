"T","he grounds of appeal, relied on by the appellant are as follows:"
"1.","The  evidence  of  PW1  is  not  credible  enough  to  prove  the  case  beyond"
"","reasonable doubt."
"2.","The 
learned  Trial  Judge  has 
failed  to  give  due  consideration  to  the"
"","improbabilities of the evidence of PW1"
"3.","The  prosecution  has 
failed  to  prove  the  exclusive  possession  of  the"
"","articles  detected,  according  to  the  statement  of  the  appellant,  from  a"
"","house that belonged to some other person."
"4.","The  failure  of  the  prosecution  to  call  the  officer  who  had  received  the"
"","information  or other witnesses to affirm the position of the prosecution,"
"","has  curtailed  the  ability  of  the  defense  to  attack  the  veracity  of  the"
"","witnesses and thereby denied a fair trial."
