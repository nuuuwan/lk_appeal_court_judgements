"i
nfallible  in  determining  which  side  is  telling  the  truth  or  is  refraining  from"
"exaggeration. Like other tribunals, he may go wrong on a question of fact, but"
"it is a cogent circumstance that a judge of first instance, when estimating the"
"value  of  verbal  testimony,  has  the  advantage  (which  is  denied  to  courts  of"
"appeal) of having the witnesses before him and observing the manner in which"
"their  evidence  is  given.”  —  per  Viscount  Simon  in  Watt  or  Thomas  v.  Thomas"
"(1947 A. C. 484 at pp. 485-0)."
"Whether  the  evidence  is  sufficient  to  support  a  particular  conclusion  is  a"
"question of law that can be considered by the Appellate Court."
"In these circumstances, I am of the view that the charges against the appellant"
"are not proved beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore I set aside the judgment of"
"High Court dated 25th July 2018. The conviction and the sentence is quashed."
"The appellant is acquitted of all four charges."
"The appeal is allowed."
