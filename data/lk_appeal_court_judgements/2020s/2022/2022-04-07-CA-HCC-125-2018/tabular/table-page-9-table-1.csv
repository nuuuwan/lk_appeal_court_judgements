"A
s  per  the  evidence  of  PW1,  the  informant  had  shown  the  appellant    from  a"
"distance of 40 meters.  The appellant was looking at the other direction so that"
"he  could  not  see  the  police  personal  approaching  him.   
I  think 
it 
is  not"
"probable  that  the  appellant  allegedly  being  a  drug  seller,    who  are  generally"
"said  to  be  vigilant  about  what  is  happening  around  them,  did  not  turn  to  the"
"other side until the three police officers had covered that 40 meters on foot."
"As per the evidence of PW1,  the appellant was standing in front of his house."
"It is not normal behaviour for a person to sell   illicit substance in front of his"
"house.  It is also unusual that the appellant was clenching (අත මිට ම  ො‌ලවමෙන"
"සිටිය )  the  heroin  in  his  fist  for  such  a  long  time  until  the  police  took  it  into"
"their custody.  The police had searched the appellant’s house.  The appellant’s"
"wife  and  the  mother-in-law  was  there.    The  police  team  had  not  found  any"
"illegal substance in the house of the appellant.  At the time when the appellant"
"was  arrested,  he  did  not  have  any  money  in  his  possession.    As  per  the"
"evidence  of  PW1,  within  a  few  minutes  after  the  arrest  of  the  appellant,  the"
"appellant  had  divulged  that  there  was  a  parcel  with  money  and  heroin  in  a"
"house about 10 meters away from the appellant’s house. The police team went"
"to  that  house  with  the  appellant. 
  The  doors  of  the  house  was  opened."
"However,  nobody  was  there  in  the  house.    They  entered  the  living  room  and"
"then  to  another    room  where,  under  a  cupboard  the  police  found  a  bag  with"
"1.77grams  of  heroin  and  Rs.  318,520.00.    The  police  team  did  not  bother  to"
"record  a  statement  from  the  owner  of  the  house  or  from  any  inmate  of  the"
"house."
"A part of the  evidence of PW1 relevant to this are as follows:"
