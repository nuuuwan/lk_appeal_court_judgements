"to  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  although  the  sections  referred  to  are  from  the  Urban"
"Council Ordinance;"
"“The  ability  of  the  Council  to  carry  out  its  statutory  functions  in  the  following  year  is"
"intrinsically  linked  to  having  a  budget  duly  passed  by  the  members  of  the  Council,  and"
"demonstrates the ability of the Chairman to command the confidence of the majority of the"
"Council and have the necessary finances to attend to the day to day operations and the vital"
"developmental activities of the Council.”"
"“….As submitted by the learned Senior State Counsel for the 1st Respondent and the learned"
"Counsel for the 7th - 17th Respondents, the Petitioner has thrown all democratic norms out"
"of the window.”"
"“Once the budget is submitted to the Council and debated and whatever the modifications or"
"additions  that  a  Chairman  may  agree  during  or  after  such  debate,  the  budget  must  be"
"submitted  by  the  Chairman  to  the  Council  for  its  decision.  This  is  mandatory  and  is"
"confirmed by the use of the word, ‘decision’ in the proviso to Section 178A. In terms of Section"
"26(2), a decision would mean a vote. I am therefore of the view that the Chairman agreeing"
"to any modifications or additions that may be proposed by one or more or even all members"
"does  not  suffice  in  order  to  claim  that  the  budget  has  been  passed.  The  claim  that  the"
"Chairman agreed with the modifications and amendments and therefore the budget has been"
"passed is a red herring. The budget must be passed by a majority vote if the Chairman wishes"
"to avoid the deemed resignation being triggered.”"
"“In my view, the crux of the matter is that the Chairman must ensure that he has in place a"
"budget duly passed by the Council by the due date. If he fails in this regard at whatever point"
"of the process, he is deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman by operation of law."
"A Chairman who does not take a vote cannot be in a better position than a Chairman who"
"has resubmitted the budget and taken a vote, only to have the budget defeated by the Council.”"
