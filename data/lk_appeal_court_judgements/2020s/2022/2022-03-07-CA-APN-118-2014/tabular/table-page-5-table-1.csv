"services of an attorney at law had been obtained by the petitioner at each level.",""
"Therefore it is the observation of this Court that the petitioner being prejudiced by",""

"an attorney  at law right through out and the trial had gone for nearly three years",""
"during  which  time  the  petitioner  had  ample  time  to  understand  that  there  is  a",""
