"of  10.250  grams  of  Heroin  and  was  charged  under  Section  54(A)  and"
"Section 54(B) of the Poisons, Opium and dangerous Drugs Ordinance, No."
"17 of 1929, as amended by Act No 13 of 1984 (hereinafter the Act). The"
"petitioner, made an application before the High Court, to have the suspect"
"enlarged on bail under exceptional circumstances, as provided by Section"
"83(1) of the Act, pursuant to the above charge."
"The law applicable to the instant application within the ambit of granting"
"bail, can be quoted below in the following manner, prior to an analysis of"
"the  merits  of 
the  application.  As  such,  Section  83(1)  of 
the  Act 
is"
"reproduced below:"
"(1)  No person suspected or accused of an offence under Section 54A or"
"Section 54B of this Ordinance shall be released on bail, except by the"
"High Court in exceptional circumstances."
"The petitioner pleads to have the suspect enlarged on bail by submitting"
"several averments before the High Court, in order to constitute exceptional"
"circumstances within the purview of the above-quoted law. The petitioner,"
"inter alia, avers the following to be the said exceptional circumstances:"
"1.  The  suspect  is  the  sole  breadwinner  of  the  house,  and  her  two"
"children  are  now 
rendered  defenseless  due 
to 
the  mother’s"
"indefinite period of incarceration."
"2.  The suspect suffers from a permanent ailment in her womb which"
"requires steady and regular medical attention, and if otherwise, the"
"suspect’s health is susceptible for aggravation."
"3.  The  suspect  has  no  previous  convictions  or  any  other  pending"
"cases."
"The learned High Court judge set out in the order dated 05.20.2021, that"
"the averments of the petitioner with regard to being the sole breadwinner"
"of the family and the health conditions of the suspect do not sufficiently"
"constitute exceptional circumstances within the ambit of the Act, for they"
"are mere circumstances in the ordinary course of life of a person. As such,"
