"the High Court dismissed the application for bail on the grounds that the"
"petitioner  has  failed  to  establish  exceptional  circumstances  required  to"
"enlarge the suspect on bail.  It must  be noted that the term ‘exceptional"
"circumstances’ is very subjective and cannot be given a firm description."
"It depends and varies on the circumstances of each case. There is a series"
"of reported cases in relation to granting of bail, which has identified the"
"term ‘exceptional circumstances’ to be depending on the circumstances of"
"each case."
"The Counsel for the petitioner relies on two major grounds as exceptional"
"circumstances before this Court."
