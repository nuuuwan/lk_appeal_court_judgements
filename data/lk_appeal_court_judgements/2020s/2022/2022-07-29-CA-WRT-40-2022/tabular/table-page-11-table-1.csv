"application  to  the  Labour  Tribunal  for  relief  or  redress  in  respect  of  the  termination  of"
"services by his employer."
"In  terms  of  Section  31(C)(1)  of  the  said  Industrial  Disputes  Act,  where  an  application"
"under Section 31(B) is made to the Labour Tribunal, it shall be the duty of the Tribunal to"
"make all such inquiries and make an order as may appear to the Tribunal to be just and"
"equitable. Thus, in my view, what is applicable to the Labour Tribunals is the law of equity"
"and essentially not the common law. This Court exercises writ jurisdiction by virtue of the"
"provisions of Article 140 of the Constitution and thereby it exercises not the Appellate or"
"Revisionary jurisdiction. The Petitioner’s instant application to this Court is for Judicial"
"Review in Administrative Law. In that context, the Labour Tribunal is not competent to"
"quash an order or a decision of a public authority based on principles of ultra vires."
"Certainly, the Labour Tribunal is qualified to analyze evidence and arrive at a conclusion"
"whether the termination of services is just and equitable. Anyhow, for the reasons set forth,"
"the Labour Tribunal is not empowered to quash the said Chairman’s aforesaid unlawful"
"decision which is the root cause for the termination of services of the Petitioner.  In the"
"circumstances, I am of the view that the Petitioner will not be able to secure an effective"
"and efficacious remedy by applying to Labour Tribunal at the first instance. The reasons"
"for my said findings are that not only the wrongful decisions of the Chairman but even the"
"subsequent decisions of the authorities flowing from the Chairman’s said decision should"
"become  void  for  the  Petitioner  to  get  an  effective  and  efficacious  remedy  upon  his  all"
"grievances."
"My view is that not only the Petitioner but many others including the officers of the CIDA"
"would  probably  get  affected  by  not  giving  due  effect  to  the  said  clause  3.3  of  the  said"
"Circular and therefore, such wrongful decisions are definitely tend to be quashed through"
"an  application  for  Judicial  Review.  Thus,  if  an  unlawful  decision  of  a  public  authority"
"affects the public as a whole other than the person who has recoursed to the Review Court,"
"such facet certainly should be taken in to consideration when the Review Judge focuses"
"his mind to the aforesaid ‘effective and efficacious remedy’."
