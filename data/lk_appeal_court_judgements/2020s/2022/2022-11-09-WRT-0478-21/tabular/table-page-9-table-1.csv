"creates a reasonable puzzle on this point as to how the Petitioner will not be suitable to"
"hold  the  post  of  the  head  of  the  Division  of  the  Academy  after  effecting  the  impugned"
"transfer on exigencies of service."
"I  am  satisfied  that  the  Petitioner’s  status,  emoluments  and  the  seniority  have  not  been"
"affected due to the impugned transfer. In other words, the Petitioner’s legal rights have not"
"been affected other than getting posted to a different place. Perhaps, the impugned transfer"
"is being challenged by the Petitioner on parallel issues although her basic rights have not"
"been  affected.  However,  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Review  Court  can  be  invoked,  if  such"
"transfer orders are found in contravention with the transfer policy or the guidelines of the"
"public authority or sufficient grounds are available to establish a plea of mala fides."
"It is the contention of the Petitioner that she was transferred due to external influences"
"and/  or  collateral  reason  at  the  behest  of  the  14th  Respondent  since  the  Petitioner,  on"
"several occasions, has refused requests made by/on behalf of the 14th Respondent to grant"
"appointments/promotions  to  certain  persons  connected  to  the  14th  Respondent.  Such"
"assertions  of  the  Petitioner  require  careful  consideration  of  this  Court.  Anyhow,  the"
"Petitioner has conceded to release the 14th Respondent from these proceedings due to the"
"reason that no relief has been sought against the said 14th Respondent against whom the"
"Petitioner  has  raised  the  purported  allegations.  It  is  important  to  note  that  when  the"
"relevant  Minister  (14th  Respondent)  has  seized  to  hold  office,  a  substitution  has  been"
"effected and as such it appears that there are no allegations on personal basis against the"
"14th  Respondent.  This,  in  my  view,  disables  the  Court  from  examining  effectively  any"
"violation of Rule of Law and failure in good governance on the part of the 14th Respondent."
