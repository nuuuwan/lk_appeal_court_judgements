"1) 
The  deceased  along  with  the  witness  had  gone  in  search  of  the"
"accused,"
"2) 
Accused had been clutching a child and holding a another,"
"3) 
The accused had pleaded with them not to come near him but the"
"deceased had resisted and had proceeded towards the accused,"
"4) 
One stab injury on the deceased which had been the fatal injury."
"Therefore  it  is  very  clear  that  it  has  ensued  from  the  deceased  quest  to"
"confront the accused and the accused had pleaded not to come near him,"
"who  had  been  with  two  children  admitted  by  the 
injured  in  evidence."
"Therefore the question arises whether it was the result of a sudden fight or"
"whether the accused had the knowledge of his actions."
"According 
to 
the  submissions  of 
the  petitioner 
the  accused  had  no"
"intention  for  the  actions  committed  but  only  knowledge  because  he  was"
"with his two children."
"The  exception  under  Section  297  of  the  penal  Code  based  on  knowledge"
"has been defined as an act which is imminently dangerous that, it must in"
"all probability cause death or  bodily injury  which is likely to cause death."
"Therefore,  Court  must  consider  the  act  done  by  the  accused  and  the"
"circumstances 
surrounding 
the 
act 
to 
determine 
the 
existence 
of"
"knowledge. In view of the evidence led at the trial this Court too sees some"
"merit in the submission because the witness says that he was clutching one"
"child to his chest. Therefore for him to be  stabbing with intention is very"
"remote"
