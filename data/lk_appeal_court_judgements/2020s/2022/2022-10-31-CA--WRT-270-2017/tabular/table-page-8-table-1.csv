"The 7th Respondent’s Claim."
"The 7th Respondent submitted that in the year 1984, certain lots that had not been auctioned in the"
"year  1981  had  been  leased  out.  The  auctioned  lots  and  the  successful  occupants’  names  are"
"reflected in P1 (b). The disputed premises  had  been originally  left as a car park  and due to the"
"unavailability of lands, the Authority had decided to lease the said Lot after dividing it into three"
"sub lots as Lot A, Lot B, and Lot C."
"It was the contention of the Respondent that subsequent to the auction in 1984, the unauctioned"
"land had also been allotted and Lot No.12B had been handed over to one H. T. Sarath on November"
"17th (1R1 annexure 2). Subsequently, the said Sarath had duly paid the lease value for a year to the"
"1st Respondent in keeping with the Gazette marked as P1 (R2A, R2B)."
