"cannot agree with the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, that P26 is ultra vires"
"of the provisions of section 22A."
"We also find that document P27 is a communication informing the decision taken in P26. Thus,"
"since we have decided not to quash P26, the Petitionerâ€™s prayers (d), (e), and (f) will have to fail."
"We also find that the failure to hand the premises pursuant to P27 has resulted in P27A. Thus, in"
"view of our decisions pertaining to P26 and 27, the prayer (g) also has to fail. It is also pertinent"
"to observe that in any event, the Petitioner has failed to establish before this  Court, that she has"
"any valid authority to occupy Lot 12B given by the Mahaweli Authority."
"In view of the admission by the 7th Respondent as well as the Petitioner, that they do not possess"
"a valid permit to occupy the premises Lot B, and in view of the fact that Lot 12B is owned by the"
"1st Respondent, in our view, the 1st Respondent is entitled to send the notice reflected in P27, as"
"for all purposes, at the time of sending the notice, the Petitioner lacks any legal authority to occupy"
"the premises owned by the 1st Respondent. Thus, she becomes an unauthorized occupier of state"
"land and becomes subject to eviction under the State Lands Recovery of Possession Act."
"Accordingly, for the aforesaid reasons, we are not inclined to grant the reliefs prayed in the petition"
"and therefore we dismiss this application without costs."
