"upon the other, but. May be cogent evidence of a resemblance between"
"the relevant basic principles of the two systems.”"
"The existence of well-annotated standard treatises on the law of defamation in"
"England   and   America   is   a   great   inducement   for   lawyers   and   judges   almost"
"instinctively   to   resort   to   them   for   the   solution   of   problems   which   should   be"
"solved according to the principles of Roman-Dutch law. At the same time, I do"
"not wish to be understood as saying that under no circumstances should"
"we examine the decisions of courts of other jurisdictions when called upon"
"to solve an intricate question of law in our system.  But the tendency to"
"resort   to   English   and   American   treatises   and   decisions   without   first"
"endeavouring to solve the problems that arise according to Roman-Dutch,"
"law should be resisted. Melius De Villiers’s Treatise on the Law of Injuries and"
"Manfred   Nathan’s   Treatise   on   the   Law   of   Defamation   in   South   Africa   afford"
"considerable assistance in ascertaining the Roman-Dutch law as developed in"
"South Africa”. [Emphasis added in this judgment]"
