"Lord Atkinson, referring to the learned Judge who tried the case said,"
"“He did not leave the question of privilege or no privilege to the jury,"
"but he did leave to the jury the question as to the presence or absence of"
"the   elements   which   go   to   create   privilege.   For   instance,   the   question"
"“Was the subject matter of the publication by the defendant matter about"
"which it was proper for the public to know?” And the question “Was the"
"matter contained in the letter proper for the public to know?” It is to be"
"regretted that the remarks of Willes J., in Henwood vs. Harrison (1) were"
"not brought to Darling J.’s notice. Willes J., a most learned, laborious"
"and accurate Judge, after stating that since the Declaratory Act of 1792"
"(32 Geo. 3, c. 60) the jury are the proper tribunal in civil as in criminal"
"cases   to   decide   the   question   of   libel   or   no   libel,   said:   “But   it   is   not"
"competent for the jury to find that, upon a privileged occasion, relevant"
"remarks made bona fide without malice are libellous”. He then proceeds:"
"It would be abolishing the law of privileged discussion and asserting the"
"duty of the Court to decide upon this as upon any other question of law,"
"if we were to hand over the decision of privilege or no privilege to the"
"jury. A jury, according to their individual views of religion or policy,"
"might hold the Church, the Army, the Navy, Parliament itself, to be"
"of no national or general importance, or the liberty of the Press to"
"be   of   less   consequence   than   the   feelings   of   a   thin-skinned"
"disputant.”  It   was   not   disputed,   in   this   case   on   either   side,   that   a"
"privileged   occasion   is,   in   reference   to   qualified   privilege,   an   occasion"
"where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty,"
"legal, social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and"
"the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to"
"receive it. This reciprocity is essential”."
