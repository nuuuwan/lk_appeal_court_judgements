"He added, “…the defendant, it has been proved, was not in such friendly terms with"
"Mr. Creasy as to justify him in indulging at the expense of Mr. Creasy in such a course"
"and vulgar joke, if joke it be, as that contained in the postscript; and the evidence"
"shows   that   the   relations   between   the   defendant   and   the   plaintiff   were   decidedly"
"strained. In these circumstances, I cannot bring myself to think that the postscript"
"was a legitimate or seasonable joke. It was rather a venomed dart intended to hit and"
"hurt”."
"In  GULICK v. GEEEN, (1918) “The letter contained the following passage: ' ""Why on"
"earth didn't you tell me Gulick was half a German, indeed three parts a German? I"
"grant I should have asked you, but it never occurred to me that there would be any"
"loose Germans about these days."""
"Shaw J., said, “There appears to me to be very little difference between the English"
"and Roman-Dutch law relating to the proof of "" malice "" or "" animus injuriandi"" in"
"actions for defamation, and such difference as there is does not affect the particular"
"circumstances of the present case."
"Although   ""   malice   ""   on   the   part.   of   the   defendant   has   always   nominally   been   an"
"ingredient to actional defamation under the English law, it has long ceased so to be in"
"fact,   and,   in  the  absence  of  privilege,  the  mere  proof  that   the  words   are  false   and"
"defamatory   constitutes   irrebuttable   proof   of   malice   in   law,   and   the   defendant's"
"intention  or motive  in  using  the words  is immaterial,  if he has, in  fact, wrongfully"
"injured the plaintiff's reputation…”"
"His lordship also said, “What difference there is in the two systems of jurisprudence is"
"thus stated by Sir Henry de Villiers in Botha v. Brink 4: ""The rule of the Roman-Dutch"
"law   differs,   if   at   all,   from   that   of   the   English   law   in   allowing   greater   latitude   in"
"disproving   malice.   Under   both   systems   the   mere   use   of   defamatory   words   affords"
"presumptive proof of malice, but under our law, as I understand it, the presumption"
"may be rebutted, not only by the fact that the communication was a privileged one, in"
"""which   case   express   malice   must   be   proved,   but   by   such   other   circumstances"
"(examples of which are given in Voet 47, 10, 20) as satisfy the Court that the ' animus"
"injuriandi ' did not exist."""
