"He added, “When, therefore, the occasion is a privileged one, under both' systems the"
"presumption   of   malice,   or   ""   animus   injuriandi   ""   is   rebutted,   and   it   lies   upon   the"
"plaintiff to prove actual malice, and this is not; done by merely proving the words to"
"have   been   untrue,   or   even   that   the   words   used   were   stronger   than   the   occasion"
"required.  It   is necessary  to  show that   the  state   of  mind of   the  defendant  was"
"malicious. To quote the words of Coleridge J. in Harrison v. Bush 1: “As the occasion"
"privileged the publication, the plaintiff had to give evidence of express malice. To do"
"this he was entitled to prove that the allegations in the libel were untrue. I do not say"
"that the mere fact of the falsehood of the allegations would prove express malice. I"
"agree that the material question was as to the state of the defendant's mind. """
"The next two passages are also quoted since they are very relevant, “The law is also"
"very clearly laid down by Lord Esher M.R. in Nevill v. Fine Arts and General Insurance"
"Company -; ""For a very long time past Judges have over and over again directed juries"
"that the defence that the occasion was privileged can only be rebutted by showing that"
"the  defendant   in   using  the  privileged  occasion   has used  it   with   actual  malice,  or  '"
"express ' malice as it has been sometimes called. Exception has been  taken to the"
"latter term; but I think that the Judges using it have always explained its meaning to"
"the jury by telling them in substance that there must have been actual malice, which"
"is a state of mind. "" This state of mind may be proved in various ways: by showing"
"personal animosity on the part of the defendant against the plaintiff; by showing that"
"the   defendant   knew   that   the   statements   made   were   untrue;   by   showing   that   the"
"statements were so reckless that the plaintiff could have had no bona fide belief in"
"their truth, and even by the defendant persisting in the truth of the statements at the"
"trial when he knew of their untruth, but not from the mere fact that the words used"
"were too strong (see Lopis L.J. in Nevill v. Fine Arts and General Insurance Company,"
"at page 170)”."
"Before examining the decision, if any, the decision of the Privy Council, with"
"regard  to  aforesaid   submissions,   it   is   pertinent   to  deduce,   propositions   that"
"can be drawn from the discussion aforementioned."
