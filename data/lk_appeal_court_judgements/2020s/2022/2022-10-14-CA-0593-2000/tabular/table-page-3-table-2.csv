"The Privy Council decided, in,  N W. DE COSTA, Appellant, and THE TIMES"
"OF CEYLON LTD. and another, Respondents, (1963) that,"
"â€œA large number of issues were framed at the trial. The learned District Judge"
"found numerous issues of fact in favour of the respondents and dismissed the"
"action. The appeal in the Supreme Court was heard by Basnayake C.J., Pulle J."
"and   Sinnetamby   J.   By   a   majority   judgment   (Basnayake   C.J.   dissenting)   the"

"inferred from the words and the occasion on which and the context and the"
"circumstances in which they are used. If the existence of animus injuriandi is"
"shown   or   can   be   presumed   to   exist   the   defence   may   seek   to   negative   it   by"
"raising a plea of justification. In order to establish that plea it is not enough to"
