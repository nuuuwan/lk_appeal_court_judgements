"Chief Justice Basnayake, further said in his lordship’s judgment,"
"“The kind of defamation that arises for consideration in the instant case, viz.,"
"publication by a newspaper to all and sundry, is the type of defamation known"
"to   Roman-Dutch   law   as   Famosis   libellis   and   falls   into   the   classification   of"
"Injuria litteris. (Voet 47. 10.10—7 Gane 226)—"
"“A wrong is done by writing when a person has assailed the reputation of"
"someone by handing a screed to the Emperor or to another; or with a"
"view to the contemning and mockery and loss of reputation of someone"
"has   made   up,   published,   noised   abroad,   made   known   to   others   or"
"printed an information, narrative, comedy, screed or jingle; or has with"
"evil intent brought about the happening of any of those things.”"
"Now when dealing with this type of defamation it is well to bear in mind that in"
"this country a newspaper enjoys no greater right than the individual citizen."
"The following words of Lord Shaw in the case of Arnold— The King Emperor of"
"India 1, though expressed  in a criminal case in relation to Burma, can with"
"equal force be used in relation to Ceylon—"
"“The freedom of the journalist is an ordinary part of the freedom, of the"
"subject, and to whatever lengths the subject in general may go, so also"
"may the journalist, but apart from statute-law, his privilege is no other"
"and   no   higher.   The   responsibilities   which   attach   to   his   power   in   the"
"dissemination of printed matter may, and in the case of a conscientious"
"journalist do, make him more careful; but the range of his assertions, his"
"criticisms, or his comments, is as wide as, and no wider than, that of any"
"other subject. No privilege attaches to his position.”"
"As   stated   by   the   learned   Chief   Justice,   while   the   tendency   to   refer   to"
"overlapping   areas   in   other   countries,   such   as   England   and   United   States,"
"because of the availability of well annonated works on those legal systems on"
"defamation, is to be resisted, the usage of the similar concepts (especially, as to"
"defences)   in   those   other   systems,   despite   having   different   terms   to   identify"
