"misstatements   of   fact,   thereby   deceiving   those   in   authority   to   whom   the"
"report or reports were rendered and causing injustice to be done to one of the"
"regiments under his command”."
"“Major Adam then went on to say, according to the report in “Hansard”, which"
"was in evidence: “Major General Scobell is on his way home at the present"
"time from South Africa. He arrives in England at the end of this week and I"
"hope when he sees the report of this paper, as I intend he shall do, he will"
"appreciate the meaning of the words, “willful and deliberate misstatement of"
"facts”. I have tried to make it clear and I hope he will turn up that paragraph"
"in the King’s Regulations which compels an officer in a case like this to refer"
"the matter to his superior authority, the superior authority in this case being"
"the Army Council. I hope sincerely that the Army Council will see that justice"
"is done to Captain Wilson and that penalties are meted out to those officers"
"who deserve it”."
"“In reference to this speech the Lord Chancellor said: “This speech must have"
"conveyed  to every  one who heard it or read the report  the impression that"
"Major General Scobell was charged with conduct unworthy of an officer and a"
"gentleman   within   the   meaning   of   King’s   Regulations.   It   is   impossible   to"
"suppose that Major Adam did not intend to convey  this impression. At the"
"trial, however, he stated that he did not impute such unworthy conduct to"
"Major General Scobell and that he said what he did merely in order that Major"
"General Scobell might demand an inquiry to clear himself, in the course of"
"which Major Adam believed information might be obtained with regard to the"
"attack upon him which he believed to be contained in the combined report”."
"“I abstain from comment upon Major Adam’s conduct in making, for such an"
"indirect   purpose,   an   unfounded   attack   upon   General   Scobell,   who   had"
"rendered Major Adam great service at the time of his removal”."
