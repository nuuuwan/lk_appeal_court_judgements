"circumstances of each particular case; for an intention of this kind has its seat in the"
"mind,   and   in   a   case   of   doubt   its   existence   should   not   be   presumed”,   (de   Villiers’"
"Translation, p. 189.)… In fact what are today regarded as the established defences in"
"defamation are, in their origin, various different ways of negativing animus injuriandi."
"With time, however, they developed into stereotyped defences whereby a presumption"
"of animus injuriandi could be rebutted. The scope of some of them like privilege and"
"fair comment are fairly clearly defined, but that of the others, like rixa, compensatio,"
"jest and mistake, is less clear. This development has been taking place over the last"
"fifty  years or more and is still taking place.  The absence of animus injuriandi still"
"exists as general category providing a substantive defence in itself. The Roman Dutch"
"Law,   under   the   rule   of   absence   of   animus   injuriandi,   still   retains   the   capacity   to"
"extend a defence into a sphere not covered by any of the established defences."
"Mr. Pritt continued,"
"“In Ceylon— and this is a case governed by the Roman Dutch Law as developed in"
"Ceylon— the defence of the absence of animus injuriandi exists as a vital, living force."
"This defence has been uniformly and consistently adopted by the Supreme Court of"
"Ceylon in Silva v. Raman Chetty 1 (1895) 1 NLR 225; David v. Bell2 (1913) 16 NLR"
"318; Cantlay v. Vanderspar 3 (1914) 17 NLR 353; Gulich v. Green i.(1918) 20 NLR"
"180."
"In  SILVA v. RAMEN CHETTY., (1895) it was said, “…the above words were per se"
"contumelious, and their publication should be presumed to have been made with a"
"contumacious   intent,   in   the   absence   of   proof   that   the   defendant   wrote   the   words"
"complained of sine injuriandi animo et affect”."
"Withers   J.,   said,   “…And   even   had   this   fact   not   been   true,   he   might   possibly   have"
"repelled the presumption of animus injuriandi by disclosing a state of circumstances,"
"including his own prudence of conduct and honesty of purpose, from which the Court"
"might have properly inferred that, though the language was contumelious, it was not"
"written with injuriandi animo et affect”."
"In  DAVID v. BELL et al, (1913) it was said, “…In a case of defamation, malice, in"
"mode   m   English   law,   is   no   more   than   the   absence   of   just   cause   or   excuse   ;   and,"
