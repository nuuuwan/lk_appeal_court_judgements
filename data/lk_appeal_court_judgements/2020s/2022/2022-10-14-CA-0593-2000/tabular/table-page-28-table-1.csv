"Earl Loreburn said,"
"““But the fact that an occasion is privileged does not necessarily protect"
"all that is said or written on that occasion. Anything that is not relevant"
"and pertinent to the discharge of the duty or the exercise of the right or"
"the safeguarding of the interest which creates the privilege  will not be"
"protected”."
