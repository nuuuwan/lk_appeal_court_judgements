"","clearly  identified  the  appellants  as  the  persons  to  whom  the"
"","deceased 
referred 
to 
in  his  dying  declaration  as  per 
the"
"","evidence  he  has  given 
in 
the  Magistrates’  Court 
that  was"
"","adopted in the trial as X-5."
"15. The","learned  Counsel 
for 
the  appellant  submitted 
that 
the"
"","learned trial Judge has acted upon the improbable evidence on"
"","the  recovery  of 
two  knives 
in 
terms  of  section  27  of 
the"
"","Evidence Ordinance. It is important to note that the two knives"
"","were  recovered  on  the  statement  made  by  the  1st  appellant."
"","Therefore,  the  evidence  of  the  said  recovery  should  not  be"
"","taken  against  the  2nd  appellant.  As  per  the  evidence  of  PW4"
"","(the police officer who recovered the knives), the 1st appellant"
"","was arrested on 08.03.93 at Seevali Lane, Borella (page 147 of"
"","the 
appeal  brief).  The  knives  were 
recovered  upon  his"
"","statement  from  Nagalagam  Street  (Page  149  of  the  appeal"
"","brief).  The  two  knives  had  been  placed  on  the  top  of  the"
"","almirah.  His  evidence  on  the  recovery  of  knives  in  terms  of"
"","section 27 has been consistent."
"16. In cross examination of the witness PW4, the position taken by",""
"","the  defence  was 
that 
the  1st 
appellant  was 
arrested 
at"
"","Seevalipura, 
and 
the 
knives  were 
recovered 
from 
the"
"","Seevalipura  house  where  he  was  arrested  (Page  154  of  the"
"","brief). The witness has denied that suggestion. However, to the"
"","contrary,  the  1st  appellant  in  his  statement  from  the  dock  had"
"","clearly said that he was arrested at Grandpass (Page 286 of the"
"","brief).  Thus, 
the  appellant  has  clearly 
taken 
two  different"
"","positions  as  to  his  place  of  arrest.  Therefore,  he  cannot  be"
"","treated as a credible witness."
"1","7. The  principles  governing  dying  declarations  were  sufficiently"
"","discussed 
in  case  of  Jayabalan  V.  U.T.  Of  Pondicherry"
"","Criminal Appeal No.1246 of 2002 on 6 November, 2009 by"
"","the Indian Supreme Court. Their Lordships referred to case of"
