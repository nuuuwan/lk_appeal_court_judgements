"of 
the  deceased 
to 
talk,  after  he  was 
injured. 
It 
is 
the"
"submission  of 
the  Counsel 
that 
the  Medical  Officer  who"
"testified at the trial on the post mortem was not the doctor who"
"conducted the post mortem."
"6
.  The 
learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General 
appearing 
for 
the"
"respondent 
submitted 
that 
the 
evidence 
on 
the 
dying"
"declarations  by 
the 
two  witnesses  for 
the  prosecution  was"
"never  challenged  by  the  defence  at  the  trial.  It  was  further"
"submitted, 
that 
the  evidence  of 
the  Medical  Officer  who"
"testified  on 
the  ability  of 
the  deceased 
to 
talk  was  never"
"challenged by the defence at the trial."
"7
.  The  two  witnesses  PW1  and  PW2  have  given  clear  evidence"
"on 
the  dying  declarations  made  by 
the  deceased 
to 
them."
"Although PW1 was cross examined by the defence Counsel at"
"the  trial,  that  piece  of  evidence  was  never  challenged.  It  was"
"not even suggested to PW1 that no such dying declaration was"
"made  by  the  deceased.  Evidence  of  PW2  given  at  the  non-"
"summary 
inquiry  was 
adopted 
in 
evidence 
at 
the 
trial."
"Although the appellants had not been represented by Counsel"
"at the non-summary inquiry, when the opportunity was given,"
"the appellants have not  cross examined the PW2, challenging"
"the  evidence  on 
the  dying  declaration.  The  document  X-5"
"shows  that  the  appellants  have  not  used  the  opportunity  to"
"cross  examine 
the  PW2.  PW2  has  clearly 
stated 
in  his"
"evidence, the dying declaration made by the deceased, and has"
"also identified the appellants as the persons referred to in the"
"dying declaration."
"8
.  The  Medical  Officer  Dr.  Kariyawasam  who  conducted 
the"
"autopsy  on  the  body  of the deceased  was  not  in a  position to"
"give  evidence  due 
to  his  health  condition.  Therefore,  Dr."
"Ratnayake,  Assistant 
Judicial  Medical  Officer  who 
had"
"worked  with  Dr.  Kariyawasam  and  was  familiar  with  his"
"signature, has given evidence based on the post mortem report"
"(PMR) prepared by Dr. Kariyawasam. At the trial, the defence"
"has admitted the expertise of Dr. Ratnayake and the admission"
"has been duly recorded by the learned High Court Judge."
"9
. 
In her evidence, based on the injuries found on the body of the"
"deceased as per the PMR, Dr. Ratnayake has clearly said that"
"the deceased may have had the ability to talk for about half an"
"hour 
after 
receiving 
the 
injuries, 
before  his 
death.  Dr."
"Ratnayake said;"
