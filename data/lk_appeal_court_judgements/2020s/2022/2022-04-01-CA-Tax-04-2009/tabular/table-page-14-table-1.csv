"define  the  term  “export”,  nor  does  it  specify  the  criteria  that  must  be"
"affirmatively satisfied in order that a supply may be classified as an export,"
"recourse  must  be  had  to  the  general  principles  of  law  applicable  for  the"
"purposes  of  determining  what  constitutes  an  export.  This  Court  is  now"
"required to find out what is meant by the phrase "" export"" for the purpose"
"of  the  Section  15  (j)    and  47  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act,  and  whether  the"
"mere supply of bunker fuel to a ship constitutes an export under Sections"
"15 (j) or 47 of the Inland Reveue Act, No. 38  of 2000."
"[35] The Appellant relies on the definition of the term “exportation given in"
"the Stroud Judicial Dictionary, Vo. II 1903 referring to the decision in A.G. v"
"Pougett 2 Price, 381) and Stockton Ry v. Barrett, 11 Cl. & F. 590) in support"
"of  his  contention  that  the  word  “export”  for  the  purpose  of  the  Inland"
"Revenue  Act,  is  not  restricted  to  an  exportation  to  foreign  countries,  but"
"may mean a carrying out of the Port The Stroud Judicial Dictionary, Vo. II"
"1903  defines  the  term  “exportation”  referring  to  the  decision  in  A.G. v"
