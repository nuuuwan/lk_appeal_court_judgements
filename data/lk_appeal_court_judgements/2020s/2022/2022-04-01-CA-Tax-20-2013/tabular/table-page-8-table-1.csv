"“Applying these several tests to the cases on hand, it is quite plaint that"
"aviation sprit loaded on board an aircraft for consumption, though"
"taken out of the country, is not exported since it has no destination"
"where it can be said to be imported, and so long as it does not satisfy"
"this test, it cannot be said that the sale was in the course of export."
"Further, as has already been pointed out, the sales can hardly be said"
"to “occasion” the export. The seller sells aviation sprit for the use of"
"the aircraft, and the sale is not integrally connected with the taking out"
"o
f
 aviation sprit. The sale is not even for the purpose of export, as"
"explained above. It does not come within the course of export, which"
"requires an even deeper relation. The sales, thus, do not come within"
"Article 286 (1)(b)”."
