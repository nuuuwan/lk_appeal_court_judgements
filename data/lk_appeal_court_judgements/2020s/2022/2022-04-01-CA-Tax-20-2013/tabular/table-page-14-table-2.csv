"Cambridge Advance Learners’ Dictionary defines the term “exportation” as"
"“the process of sending goods to another country for sale”.  In the Merriam-"
"Webster  Online  Dictionary,  the  term  export  means  “to  carry  or  send"
"(something, such as a commodity) to some other place (such as another"
"country).  Accordingly,  the  Dictionary  meaning  of  the  word  “export”  of"
"goods  as  normally  understood  is  “sending  goods”  from  one  country  to"
"another country for sale."
"[34] However, the meaning of a word in a statute may also be affected by"
"its context, which may consist of surrounding sections, the  whole Act or"
"the scheme or purpose of the legislation and the exceptions or deduction"
"granted  thereunder.    Thus,  one  has  to  construe  the  scope  of  the  term"
"“export”  in  the  context  in  which  it  occurs  in  Sections  42  and  52  of  the"
"Inland Revenue Act, having regard to the nature of the goods that are to"
"be exported, namely, the bunker fuel being a  petroleum product which"
"is not manufactured in Sri Lanka but, used for the navigation of vessels,"
