"supplied to a foreign going  vessel for navigation  occasions  an  export and"
"eligible for the concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland"
"Revenue Act if it is delivered by the supplier directly to a foreign going vessel"
"and received by its owner/operator for navigation on the high seas out of"
"Sri Lanka, with evidence of a foreign destination point."
"[97] I do not think that given the nature of the goods being the bunker fuel,"
"which is supplied to the operator/owner of the ship for navigation on the"
"high  seas 
for 
the  next 
foreign  destination  point, 
the  requirement 
in"
"traditional  export  of  cargo  where  the  goods  are  exported  to  a  specified"
"recipient in another foreign jurisdiction is necessary to constitute an export"
"under Sections 42 or 52  of the Inland Revenue Act. The above-mentioned"
"second illustration that goods put on board a streamer bound for a foreign"
"country,  but  jettisoned  can  still  be  said  to  have  been  “exported”,  even"
"though they do not reach their destination vividly explains this proposition"
"in case of bunker fuel which is supplied for navigation. Another illustration"
"is  where  goods  shipped  from  Colombo  intended  for  delivery  in  Bombay"
"proceeded  on  a  voyage, 
leaving  the  Sri  Lankan  territorial  waters,  but"
"developed engine trouble and returned and ran aground in the Sri Lankan"
"territorial waters at Hambantota Port. In this illustration, the ship intended"
"to deliver the goods at Bombay Port (destination point) and moved out of"
"the  Sri  Lankan  territorial  waters  and  the  export  was  complete  when  the"
"goods  were  taken  beyond  the  territorial  waters  of  Sri  Lanka  with  the"
"intention of delivering at Bombay Port. The fact that the ship was brought"
"back to Sri Lanka did not affect as the goods sold were intended to be taken"
"to that foreign destination point, namely, the Bombay Port."
"[98] I hold that the concessionary tax rates under Sections 42  or 52 of the"
"Inland Revenue Act in the present case applies to the bunker fuel directly"
"supplied to the operator or owner of the foreign going vessel to be used for"
"navigation on the high seas (out of the territorial waters of Sri Lanka) and"
"intended to a destination point of another country. This finding is limited to"
"this case and it shall not in any way be construed as an application to other"
"goods 
in  respect  of  which  concessionary  tax  rates  are  claimed  under"
"Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act."
"[99] How can the Appellant satisfy that that the ship carrying bunker fuel for"
"navigation  was  taken  out  of  the  Sri  Lankan  territorial  waters?    It  must  be"
