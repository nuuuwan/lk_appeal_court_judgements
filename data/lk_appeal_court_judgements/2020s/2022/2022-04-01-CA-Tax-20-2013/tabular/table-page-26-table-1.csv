"acknowledged  purpose  of  that  section  is  remembered?  The"
"l
egislation is plainly addressed to those persons, and to those alone,"
"who increase the foreign exchange reserves of New Zealand, by"
"sending goods abroad, or causing them to be sent abroad, receiving"
"i
n
 
return foreign exchange for which they are bound to account, and"
"do account, to the Reserve Bank. It is clear that even if the travellers"
"may be regarded as themselves ""exporting” the goods, the word"
"""export” where used in the section must also clearly be applicable to"
"those, such as respondent company, who send the goods abroad, or"
"cause them to be sent, with this result. Surely a dairy company"
"""exports” butter, and a fruit cannery ""exports” its manufactures,"
"whether it ships the goods to its own order in another country, or"
"sells here f.o.b. to a foreign person or corporation, provided simply"
"that the transaction is one in which it causes goods to be sent abroad"
"i
n
 exchange for foreign currency which it receives and for which it"
"accounts. t is to be observed however that s 129B is solely concerned"
"with  the  actions  of  vendors.  In  our  opinion  a  vendor  may  export"
