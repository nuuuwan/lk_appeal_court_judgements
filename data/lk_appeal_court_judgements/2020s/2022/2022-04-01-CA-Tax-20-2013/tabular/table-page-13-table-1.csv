"[28] Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edition, page 28), deals with"
"the concept of literal construction in the following words:"
"“The first and most elementary rule of construction is that is it is to be"
"assumed that the words and phrases of technical legislation are used"
"i
n
 
their technical meaning if they have acquired one, and otherwise in"
"their ordinary meaning, and the second is that the phrases and"
"sentences are to be construed according to the rules of grammar. 'The"
"l
ength and detail of modern legislation, wrote Lord Evershed M.R., 'has"
"undoubtedly reinforced the claim of literal construction as the only"
"safe rule.' If there is nothing to modify, alter or qualify the language"
"which the statute contains, it must be construed in the ordinary and"
"natural meaning of the words and sentences. The safer and more"
"correct course of dealing with a question of construction is to take the"
"words themselves and arrive if possible at their meaning without, in"
"the first instance, reference to cases”."
