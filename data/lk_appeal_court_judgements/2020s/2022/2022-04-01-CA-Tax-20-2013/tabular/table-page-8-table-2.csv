"requires an even deeper relation. The sales, thus, do not come within"
"Article 286 (1)(b)”."
"[17] It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the"
"concept of export in India as reflected in the Indian authorities is based on"
"different principles such as the existence of two termini and the intention"
"of their being landed in a different port. He submitted that the real test is"
"whether or not the bunker fuel was taken out of the Sri Lankan territorial"
"waters  and therefore, the Indian authorities are irrelevant for the purpose"
"of  deciding  the  concessionary  tax  rate  under  Sections  42  and  52  of  the"
"Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)."
"[18] It is true that the decision in Burmah-Shell Oil Storage & Distribution"
"Company Ltd v. Commercial Taxing Office and Othes (supra) is based on"
"constitutional provisions of the Indian Constitution, [Article 286 (1) (b)] and"
"Section 5 of the CENTRAL SALES TAX ACT to define the word “export” and"
"such principles are not binding on the Courts of Sri Lanka. Hence, this Court"
"is called upon to decide the question of whether the supply of bunker fuel"
"to  ships  constitutes  an  “export”  under  Sections  42  or  52  of  the  Inland"
"Revenue  Act,  No.  10  of  2006,  independent  of    the  Indian  authorities  in"
"particular,  the  case  of Burmah-Shell Oil Storage & Distribution Company"
"Ltd v Commercial Taxing Office and Othes (supra)."
"Statutory Provisions"
"[19]  Before  embarking  upon  the  rival  contentions  of  the  parties,  I  may"
"proceed to notice the relevant statutory provisions which have a bearing"
"on  the  issue.  Section  42    of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act,  No.  10  of  2006  (as"
"amended),  which  sets  out  the  rate  of  income  tax  on  profits  and  income"
