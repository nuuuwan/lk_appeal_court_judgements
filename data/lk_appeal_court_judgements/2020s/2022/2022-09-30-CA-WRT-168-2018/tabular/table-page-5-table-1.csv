"Respondent had sublet his rights of tenant cultivator without the consent or the approval of the"
"Claimant-owner and thereby contravened the provisions of the Agrarian Development Act2."
"The question before the inquiring officer was whether the 1st  Respondent sublet his tenancy"
"rights in contravention of the provisions of the Agrarian Development Act."
"The Petitioner contends that the 1st Respondent-Respondent the tenant cultivator had fallen ill in"
"the year 1998 and that on the request of the tenant cultivator, he had taken over and commenced"
"cultivating. It is his position that he had gone with the 1st  Respondent-Respondent to meet the"
"owner Sompala Mendis and with his consent had commenced cultivating. This  position was"
"vehemently denied by the Claimant-Respondent. In the face of this denial, the Petitioner failed to"
"substantiate his contention with any documentary evidence and failed to explain why he was"
"unable to call the said Somapala Mendis as a witness. It is pertinent to note that as per the statute,"
"for the Petitioner to succeed as the subtenant cultivator, he should have established that he was in"
"possession of the written consent of the owner of the paddy field, which the Petitioner has failed"
"to demonstrate. The Petitionerâ€™s contention of him being the tenant cultivator still becomes weak"
"in view of document 1X2 which will be dealt with elsewhere in this judgment. Thus, whether the"
"Petitioner is cultivating this paddy field with the consent of the owner, becomes a disputed fact."
"As   submitted,   the   Complainant-Respondents   complaint   to   the   Commissioner   was   two   folds,"
"namely, the Petitioner is not the tenant cultivator but a sublessee of the tenant cultivator, who had"
"sublet the tenancy without the consent of the owner, thereby violating the provisions of the Act"
"and for eviction."
"In response, it was the contention of the Petitioner  that even at the time of the inquiry, the"
"Petitioner was cultivating the paddy field and thereby he becomes the tenant cultivator and that"
"he   had   at   all   times   given   the   rent   to   the   owner,   firstly   to   Somapala   and   thereafter   to   the"
"Complainant-Respondent. This contention too was denied by the Complainant-Respondent"
"This Court observes that the Petitioner has failed to submit before the Commissioner or to this"
"Court any receipts pertaining to the payment of the rent by him. The Petitioner had submitted"
"before the Commissioner that the inability to tender the receipts for rent was due to his house"
"being affected by the tsunami in the year 2004. However, as submitted by the Complainant-"
"Respondent,   this   Court   observes   that   the   Petitioner   has   failed   to   adduce   any   independent"
"evidence or material to substantiate this contention.  Nevertheless, it is pertinent to note that the"
"Petitioner had failed to submit any receipts for payment of rent by him even after the year 2004"
"till the commencement of the inquiry before the Commissioner."
"It is also pertinent to note that as reflected in the documents marked 1R1 to 1R5 before the"
"Commissioner,   the   Respondents   had   issued   rental   receipts   for   the   period   2005/2006   and"
"2007/2008. The said receipts had been issued in the name of the registered tenant cultivator"
"Premadasa. This refutes the contention of the Petitioner that he had been the tenant cultivator"
"since 1998 and that it was he who had paid the rent. The learned Presidents Counsel for the"
"Petitioner   submitted   that   even   though   the   receipts   had   been   issued   in   the   name   of   the   1 st"
"Respondent Premadasa, the rent was  paid by the Petitioner.  It was further submitted  by the"
"2 Section 7(10) of Act no 46 of 2000"
