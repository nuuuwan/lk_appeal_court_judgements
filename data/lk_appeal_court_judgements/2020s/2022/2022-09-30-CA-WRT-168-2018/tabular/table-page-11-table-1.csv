"In  Biso Menika Vs Cyril De Alwis & others 1982 (1) SLR 368  it was held  “A person who"
"applies   for   the   extra-ordinary   remedy   of   writ   must   come   with   clean   hands   and   must   not"
"suppress   any   relevant   facts   from   Court.   He   must   refrain   from   making   any   misleading"
"statements to Court”. The importance of coming to court with clean hands was recently stressed"
"in Orient Pearl Hotels vs Cey Nor-Foundation Limited & others CA Writ 226/2018 decided"
"on 02.08.2021 where it was held “It is settled law that a party seeking prerogative relief should"
"come to court with clean hands. The expression is derived from one of equity’s maxims – He"
"who comes to Equity must come with clean hands.”"
"In our view, we find that the Petitioner by his own acts has disentitled himself to the relives"
"prayed.  Namely, he has failed to demonstrate that he has taken any meaningful steps to amend"
"the paddy land register and get himself registered as the tenant cultivator thus, depriving him of"
"any legal right.   We also find that in view of documents 1X1 and 1X2 and also of documents"
"1R1 – 1R5 marked before the Commissioner, and to which the Court’s attention was drawn, the"
"Petitioner’s   inability   to   submit   any   receipts   issued   to   him   for   payment   of   rent   up   to   the"
"proceedings being filed before the Commissioner, defeats the Petitioner’s argument that he is the"
"tenant cultivator and had been cultivating since 1998. Further in view of the above-mentioned"
"marked documents and in view of the Complainant-Respondent’s denial of the Petitioner being"
"the tenant cultivator, the Petitioner’s contention of him cultivating the land since 1998 as the"
"tenant cultivator becomes a disputed fact."
"Another instance the Petitioner has failed to explain is, as submitted by the learned state Counsel,"
"the document 1X2 is an acknowledgment issued by the Complainant-Respondent. In the said"
"document the 1st Respondent-Respondent had signed when he was handing over the rent in his"
"capacity as the tenant cultivator.  One of the witnesses in this transaction of handing over the rent"
"is the Petitioner. This clearly establishes that in the year 2000 the tenant cultivator had been the"
"1st Respondent-Respondent. The Petitioner has failed to explain how he attested as a witness for"
"handing   over   of   the   rent   by   the   1st  Respondent-Respondent   if   the   Petitioner   was   the   tenant"
"cultivator as alleged by himself. The Petitioner has failed to explain his failure to disclose this"
"document. Thus, the objection on suppression and misrepresentation succeeds."
"We   also   find   that   the   Petitioner   has   failed   to   demonstrate   any   illegality,   irrationality   or"
"procedural impropriety of the proceedings before the Commissioner General or in the impugned"
"order."
"This Court also observes that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that he had requested that"
"he be determined as the tenant cultivator and accordingly to amend the Register and that request"
"had been refused. In light of the above observation, and in the absence of a refusal, this Court is"
"of the view that prayer (C) of the petition has to fail. In the case of Ratnayake and Others v"
"C.D Perera  and  others (1982) 2 SLR 451 at 456,  it was  held, that  “The general rule of"
"mandamus is that its function is to compel a public authority to do its duty. The essence of"
"mandamus is that it is a command issued by the Superior Court for the performance of public"
"legal   duty.   Where   officials   have   a   public   duty   to   perform   and   have   refused   to   perform,"
