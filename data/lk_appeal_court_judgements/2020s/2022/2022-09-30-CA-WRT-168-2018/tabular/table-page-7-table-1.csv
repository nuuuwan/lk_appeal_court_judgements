"Counsels’   submission   that   the  prima   facia  proof   offered   by   the   extracts   of   the   paddy   land"
"registry can be rebutted. However, this should be done with credible and cogent evidence. The"
"burden is on the Petitioner to submit independent oral and documentary evidence in rebuttal. In"
"our view, the Petitioner has failed to rebut this presumption and has failed to adduce any reason"
"for his failure to effect an amendment and insert his name on the register, especially as alleged, if"
"he had been the tenant cultivator from 1998 till the complaint was made. As per document 3R2"
"the complaint had been made in the year 2011. Even at the argument stage, the Petitioner failed"
"to give an explanation as to why he failed to take any steps pertaining to amending and inserting"
"his name in the register. Thus, in our view, the Petitioner has failed to avail himself of the best"
"evidence   to   establish   his   tenancy.   Accordingly,   this   Court   respectfully   disagrees   with   the"
"Petitioner’s argument that there is sufficient evidence adduced by him to rebut the presumption."
"With   his   failure   to   sufficiently   rebut   with   cogent   evidence,   the   presumption   defeats   his"
"contention that he was the legally accepted tenant."
"It is also pertinent to note that if a tenant wants to relinquish his tenancy rights it is provided for"
"in the Act itself3. The Petitioner has failed to establish before the Commissioner or this Court that"
"the 2nd Respondent had ceded his rights for tenancy under the Act. He has failed to produce any"
"document   or   independent   evidence   to   establish   his   contention   that   subsequent   to   the   2nd"
"Respondent ceding his rights as the tenant cultivator, he had the consent and the recognition of"
"the owner to be the tenant cultivator as per the provisions of the Act."
"This Court has considered the Petitioner’s contention that he had assumed the tenancy rights and"
"should be considered the tenant cultivator when the 1st Respondent ceded his tenancy rights as"
"opposed to the Claimant Respondent’s argument that the Petitioner is only a sublessee of the 1st"
"Respondent and was cultivating in the said capacity of a sublessee. In this regard, it is also"
"pertinent to consider the evidence of 1st Respondent-Respondent Premadasa that had been placed"
"before this court (page 66 of the brief) which states as follows."
"Q -: තමන් අතයට හ(cid:8)ෝ(cid:10)........... කීඩමන්ට බදු දුන්නෝ"
"A-: කට වචහනන් බදු දුන්නෝ"
"This clearly establishes that the 1st Respondent, the tenant cultivator had sublet the tenancy to the"
"Petitioner."
"Impugned order"
"The   Petitioner   submitted   the   impugned   order   marked   as   “Y”   however   the   Respondents"
"contended that the said purported order tendered by the Petitioner is only a part of the order and"
"tendered the complete order marked as 3R2 to which the learned presidents Counsel appearing"
"for the Petitioner did not object."
"The Petitioner’s  main  contention  was  that  he has  established  that  he had cultivated  the said"
"paddy   field   from   1998   and   that   he   had  cultivated   the   said   land   in   the   capacity   of   a  tenant"

"further argued that he cultivated with the consent of the owner who was one Somapala.  It was"
