"learned Counsel for the Petitioner, that 1st  Respondent-Respondent Premadasa, in his evidence"
"before   the   Commissioner,   had   denied   the   said   receipts   being   issued   to   him.   However,   the"
"Petitioner was unable to explain to this Court why he had not objected to the receipts being"
"issued in the name of the 1st Respondent- Respondent when the Petitioner was paying the rent"

"lessee lets such extent to any person (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the ‘sub-tenant"
"cultivator) and extent by reason of his being the cultivator thereof, the sub tenant’s right as the"
"tenant cultivator of such extent shall not be affected in any manner by the termination of the"
"lease granted by the lessor to the lessee:"
"Provided that the lessee shall not let such extent of paddy land to a sub-tenant cultivator"
