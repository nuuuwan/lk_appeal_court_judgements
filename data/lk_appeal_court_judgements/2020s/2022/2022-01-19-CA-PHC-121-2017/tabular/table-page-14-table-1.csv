"Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal held that in terms of sec. 20(2)(a), notwithstanding"
"notice of repudiation, an award made by an arbitrator is binding on the parties to the"
"award for a minimum period of 12 months. During the period specified in section 20(2)"
"(a),  any  person  who  acts  in  violation  of  such  an  award  would  be  contravening  the"
"provisions of section 40(1)(a) of the Industrial Disputes Act and would thus be guilty of"
"an offence punishable under sec 43 (1) read with section 43 (4) of the Act. In coming to"
"such  a  conclusion,  the  determining  factor  was  that  when  the  plaint  was  filed,  the"
"arbitrator's  award  bound  the  accused-respondents  as  it  was  yet  to  cease  effect.  The"
"judgment observed the following"
"“State Counsel also urged that even where an award is repudiated if a party acts"
"in violation of the award during the period specified in section 20(2)(x) of the Act,"
"such party commits an offence under section 40 (1) (a) of the  Industrial Disputes"
"Act….  I  am  in  agreement  with  the  submissions  made  by  State  Counsel  on  this"
"question,  and  I  hold  that  during  the  period  specified  in  section  20(2)(a)  of  the"
"Industrial Disputes Act, any person who acts in violation of such an award would"
"be contravening the provisions of section 40(1)(a) of the Industrial Disputes Act, and"
"would thus be guilty of an offence under this Act, which would be punishable under"
"section 43 (1) read with section 43 (4) of the said Act."
"I am of the view therefore, that the learned Magistrate was in error when he held"
"that with the repudiation of the award such award ceased to have effect, and that"
"the court had no jurisdiction to order the accused-respondents to comply with such"
"award. We therefore set aside the order of the learned Magistrate and allow the"
"appeal  and  remit  this  case  back  to  the  Magistrate's  Court.  The  Magistrate  is"
"directed to proceed with the trial in this case and make an order in accordance with"
"the law.”"
"Upon  an  extrapolation  of  the  above  judicial  pronouncements  and  in  line  with  the"
"precedent  set  by  Kulathunga  (supra),  it  is  evident  that  the  event  chronology  of  the"
"present  case  is  the  basis  in  determining  the  issue  whether  the  criminal  prosecution"
"against the respondent could be maintained in light of the repudiation of the arbitral"
