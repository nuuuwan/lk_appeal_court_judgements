the  nomination  of  an  arbitrator

"Compulsory arbitration can only arise  on a reference made to the Minister  of Labour"
"who may, if he is of the opinion that an industrial dispute is a minor dispute, refer it by"
"an order in writing for settlement by arbitration to an arbitrator appointed by him or to"
"a labour tribunal even though the parties to such dispute or their representatives do"
"not  consent  to  such  reference  (Section  4(1))  –  The  Legal  Framework  of  Industrial"
