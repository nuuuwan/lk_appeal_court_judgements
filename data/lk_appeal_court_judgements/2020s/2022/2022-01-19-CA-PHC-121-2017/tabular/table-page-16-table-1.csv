"than resorting to a writ jurisdiction, is to repudiate the arbitral award, which has been"
"done in the present instance."
"During the argument stage, the counsel for the petitioner submitted that in delivering"
"the judgment of Thirunawakarasu (supra), the court did not have the benefit of hearing"
"submissions on the fact of criminal prosecution; rather, they were assisted by counsel"
"only  on  the  point  of  whether  a  subsequent  quantification  of  compensation  under  an"
"arbitral  award  could  be  allowed  in  light  of  repudiation  of  the  same.  The  counsel"
"attempted  to  distinguish  the  relief  prayed  in  the  Thirunawakarasu  case,  stating  that"
"unlike  in  the  present  application,  the  Thirunawakarasu  case  did  not  pray  for  a  re-"
"prosecution of a criminal trial by the Magistrate Court. Counsel for the petitioner relied"
"on the Thirunawakarasu case only to the extent of delineating the effect of repudiation"
"as ‘prospective’ thereby contending that the subsequent repudiation by the respondent"
"did not obviate him from criminal liability the respondent incurred when the respondent"
"failed to comply with the award of the arbitrator. To further buttress the argument, the"
"counsel relied on section 456 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which set out the period"
"of  prescription  for  crimes  or  offences  and  held  that  criminal  proceedings  could  be"
"maintained  against  the  respondent  despite  repudiation.    The  said  section  states  as"
"follows:"
"“The right of prosecution for murder or treason shall not be barred by any length of"
"time, but the right of prosecution for any other crime or offence (save except those"
"as  to  which special provision is or shall be made by law)  shall  be barred by  the"
"lapse  of  twenty  years  from  the  time  when  the  crime  or  offence  shall  have  been"
"committed.”"
"In light of the above discussion on the effect of a repudiation of an arbitral award and"
"following the precedent set by Kulatunga, Labour Officer, Colombo South v Dodangoda"
"and  Others  (supra)  it  is  the  considered  view  of  the  Court  that  a  need  to  examine  an"
"‘offence’ or application of section 456 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not arise"
"in the given case as a legally binding and valid award of the arbitrator did not subsist"
