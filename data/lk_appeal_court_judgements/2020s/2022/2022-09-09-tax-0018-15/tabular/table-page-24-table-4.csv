"for  the  tax  holiday  period  of  5  years  commencing  from  01.04.2003  to"
"31.03.2008, His Lordship Surasena, J. held at page 16:"
"These  facts  clearly  show  that  the  year  of  assessment  1998/1999  is  not"
"qualified to be a year of tax exemption as it has not met any of the two"
"requirements set out above. Therefore, the year of assessment 1998/1999"
"is not within the tax exemption period determined by the BOI. Thus, any"
"profit  that  may  have  been  made  during  that  year  becomes  assessable"
