"Appellant was identified by PW4 at the identification parade. The Appellant",""

"period of the attempted robbery incident. This evidence clearly proves that",""

"The lay witnesses who gave evidence told that three persons had entered the",""

"The prosecution through PW10, clearly established that the Appellant had",""

"closed to the crime scene subsequently were sent to the Government Analyst",""
"for confirmation. The report which had been marked as P5 confirmed that",""

"During the trial, the remains of the hand bombs were not available, as all",""
