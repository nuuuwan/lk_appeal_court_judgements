"n  Turnbull  [1977]  QB  224  the  Court  of  Appeal  laid  down  the  following"
"guidelines for judges in trials that involve disputed identification evidence."
"“Where the case against an accused depends wholly or substantially on"
"the  correctness  of  one  or  more  identifications  of  the  accused,  which  the"
"defence  alleges  to  be  mistaken,  the  judge  should  warn  the  jury  of  the"
"special need for caution before convicting  the  accused  in reliance on  the"
"correctness of the identification(s)”."
