"Accordingly, I set aside the voir dire inquiry order dated 31-03-2015 in relation"
"to the alleged confession by the appellant, as it cannot be allowed to stand and"
"reject the acceptance of the statement as evidence."
"The only evidence the prosecution relied on against appellant in order to prove"
"the charges preferred against him was the alleged confession marked ‘P-01’ at"
"the  trial.  In  view  of  the  rejection  of  the  same,  I  find  no  basis  to  allow  the"
"conviction of the appellant to stand either."
"Therefore, I set aside the conviction and the sentence dated 15-06-2017 by the"
"learned High Court Judge of Monaragala and acquit the appellant of the charges"
"preferred against him."
