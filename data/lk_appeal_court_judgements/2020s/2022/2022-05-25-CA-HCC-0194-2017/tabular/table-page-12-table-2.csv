"prove the inducement, threat or promise.”",""
"Per Malcolm Perera, J.",""
"","“At  the  outset,  the  Court  must  determine  the  meaning  of  the  word"
"","appears. I think what the Court has to decide is not whether it has"
"been  proved  that  there  is  a  threat,","inducement,  or  promise,  but"
"","whether it appears to Court that such threat, inducement or promise,"
"","was  present.  I  am  inclined  to  the  view  that  the  word  “appears”"
"","indicates a lesser degree of probability than it would have been, if the"
"","word “proof” as defined in section 03 of the Evidence Ordinance has"
"appeared in section 24.”",""
