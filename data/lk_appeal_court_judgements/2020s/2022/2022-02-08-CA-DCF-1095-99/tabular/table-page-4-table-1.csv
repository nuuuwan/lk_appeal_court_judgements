"In his judgment, the learned District Judge has observed as follows,"
"“මුලින්ෙ දෙෙ විෂයවස්තුව ෙැන පිඹුරක් ඉදිරිපත්ත කල මිනින්දෙෝරු යාපා ෙහතාදේ X"
"ෙරණ  සැලැස්දේ  දපන්වාදී  ඇති  කැබලි  අංක  1  සහ  2  හි  දකාටසක්  විෂයවස්තුදවන්"
"ඉවත්තවිය  යුතු  බව  දෙෙ  අධිකරණයට  දෙෙ  නඩුදව්  ඉදිරිපත්තූ  සාක්ි  අනුව"
"දපනීයයි…… ඒ අනුව දෙෙ විෂයවස්තුව දෙෙ නඩුදව් X ෙරණ සැලැස්දේ මිනින්දෙෝරු"
"යාපා  ෙහතාදේ  අංක  2906  ෙරණ  සැලැස්දේ  කැබලි  අංක  1,  2  හි  දකාටසක්"
"විෂයවස්තුදවන්  ඉවත්තවිය  යුතු  බවත්ත  ඒ  අනුව  ෙැන  දබොෙැනීෙට  ඉල්ලා  සිටින"
"විෂයවස්තුව Y සැලැස්දේ කැබලි අංක 1, 2, 3 වියයුතු බවට තීන්දු කරමි.”"
"Therefore, the learned District Judge has come to the conclusion that the corpus"
"consists of lots 1, 2, 3 in the Plan marked ‘Y’ and a portion of lots 1 and 2 in Plan"
"marked  ‘X’  should  be  excluded.  In  preparing  the  Plan  marked  ‘Y’  Surveyor"
"Gamage has excluded the portion of lots 1 and 2 in Plan X which are portions of"
"the adjoining land ‘Kanuketiya Deniya’ alias ‘Kanuketiya Deniya Kumbura’ from"
"the  corpus  and  depicted  the  corpus  as  lots  1,  2  and  3  in  plan  marked  ‘Y’."
"According to the evidence of Surveyor Gamage and the superimposition shown"
"in  Plan  ‘Y’,  the  entirety  of  lot  1  and  a  portion  of  lot  2  in  plan  ‘X’  has  been"
"excluded. Yet a small portion of Lot 2 in Plan ‘X’ has come into the corpus and"
"forms a part of lot 1 in Plan ‘Y’. Surveyor Gamage has not shown that portion as"
"a separate lot and it is merged with the rest of the land in lot No. 1 of Plan ‘Y’."
"According to the Issues No. 10 and 11, the 1st and 2nd Defendants are seeking to"
"establish a prescriptive right to lot 1 and 2  in Plan X and they are seeking to"
"exclude those 2 lots on that basis. The entirety of lot 1 and a portion of lot 2 in"
"Plan ‘X’ has already been excluded from the corpus in Plan ‘Y’ and only a portion"
"of lot 2 in Plan ‘X’ has come into the corpus and forms part of lot 1 in Plan Y and"
"the 1st and 2nd Defendants will have to confine their prescriptive claim to that"
"portion of land which is not shown as a separate lot."
"The law governing the term of prescription for immovable property is contained"
"in Section 3 of the Ordinance No. 22 of 1871 as amended by Ordinance No. 2 of"
"1889.  Section  3  declares  that  “proof  of  the  undisturbed  and  uninterrupted"
"possession by a defendant in any action, or by those under whom he claims, of"
"lands or immovable property, by a title adverse to or independent of that of the"
"Claimant or Plaintiff in such action (that is to say, a possession unaccompanied"
"by payment of rent or produce, or performance of service or duty, or by any"
"other act by the possessor from which an acknowledgement of a right existing"
"in another person would fairly and naturally be inferred) for ten years previous"
"to  the  bringing  of  such  action,  shall  entitle  the  defendant  to  a  decree  in  his"
"favour with costs”."
