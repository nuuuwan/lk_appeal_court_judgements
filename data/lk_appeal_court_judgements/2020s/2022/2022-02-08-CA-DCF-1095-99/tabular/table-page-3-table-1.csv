"Lot 1 and 2 are not a part of the corpus. At the trial the 1st and 2nd Defendants"
"had taken up the position that they had possessed the aforesaid lots 1 and 2 as"
"a part of Kanuketiya deniya (කුණුකැටියදෙණිය) alias Kanuketiya deniya Kumbura"
"(කුණුකැටියදෙණිය කුඹුර) and acquired a prescriptive title to it. Plan No. 118816"
"made by the Surveyor General in January 1881 which was marked ‘Z’ at the trial"
"depicts the land called Kanuketiya deniya claimed by the 1st and 2nd Defendants."
"D.M. Gamage L.S. had superimposed that plan on the Commissioner’s Plan No."
"2906 and prepared the Plan No. 528 අ which was marked ‘Y’ at the trial. The"
"superimposed boundaries of T.P No. 118816 are shown in red. According to that"
"superimposition,  Commissioner  had  included  a  portion  of  Kanuketiya  deniya"
"into the corpus. Surveyor Gamage had excluded that portion from the corpus in"
"his plan ‘Y’ and shown the corpus as lots 1, 2 and 3. But he had not excluded the"
"entirety  of  Lot  1  and  2  in  the  Preliminary  Plan  marked  ‘X’.  According  to  the"
"evidence  of  Surveyor  Gamage  he  had  excluded  the  entirety  of  Lot  1  and  a"
"portion of Lot 2 in Plan X. A portion of Lot 2 in Plan X continues to be inside the"
"corpus."
"In  their  amended  Statement  of  Claim  dated  09.06.1994,  the  1st  and  2nd"
"Defendants had taken up the position that Lot 1 and 2 in Plan X are a portion of"
"the  adjoining  land  Kanuketiya  deniya  alias  Kanuketiya  Deniya  Kumbura  and"
"sought  for  an  exclusion  of  the  said  lots  on  the  basis  that  they  are  a  part  of"
"Kanuketiya deniya alias Kanuketiya Deniya Kumbura. They had also prayed for a"
"prescriptive right to the aforesaid lots."
"At the trial the following two issues were raised by the 1st and 2nd Defendants."
"10) දෙෙ නඩුවට සාො ඇති එස්.ආර් යාපා ෙහතාදේ අංක 2906 ෙරණ සැලැස්දේ කැබලි"
"අංක  1  හා  2  දකාටස  1,  2  විත්තතිකරුවන්  කණුකැටිදේ  දෙණිය  දහවත්ත  කණුකැටිදේ"
"දෙණිදේ කුඹුදර් දකාටස් සියල්ලෙ නිෙහස්ව හා නිරවුල්ව අවුරුදු 10 කට වැඩි කාලයක්"
"භුක්තිවිඳ කාලාවදරෝධි අයිතිවාසිකේ හිමිකරදෙන ඇත්තදත්තෙ?"
"11)  ඉහත  විසදිය  යුතු  ප්‍රශ්නයට  ‘ඔව්’  යන  පිළිතුර  ලැදබන්දන්නේ    දබදීෙට  අොළ"
"ඉඩදෙන් අංක 2906 ෙරන මූලිඛ සැලැස්දෙන් (මූලිඛ සැලැස්දේ) කැබලි අංක 1, 2 ඉවත්ත"
"කල යුතුෙ?"
"The learned District Judge had answered the Issue No. 10 in the negative. By"
"answering the issue in the negative the learned District Judge has come to the"
"conclusion that the 1st and 2nd Defendants had failed to prove a prescriptive right"
"to Lots 1 and 2 in the Preliminary Plan marked ‘X’. Therefore, the Issue No. 11"
"does not arise."
