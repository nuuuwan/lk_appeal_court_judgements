"At the hearing of this appeal, it was contended by the learned Counsel for the"
"appellant that there are serious contradictions in the evidence of PW-01 as to"
"the incident which has created a doubt whether the appellant has in fact solicited"
"any money. Pointing to the evidence that the alleged solicitation has been after"
"the admission of the child to the school, it was his submission that there was a"
"serious question as to the probability of the story of PW-01 and a question as to"
"who solicited the money."
"It was also the submission of the learned Counsel that although PW-02 who was"
"the  decoy  has  stated  that  he  wanted  the  appellant  to  reduce  the  amount"
"demanded as a bribe when he and PW-01 met the appellant, in the evidence of"
"PW-01 she has not stated so, which he referred to as a contradiction inter se of"
"the evidence of PW-01 and PW-02."
"He was also of the view that the learned High Court Judgeâ€™s determination that"
"PW-07 Madanayake and PW-08 Asanka are partisan witnesses and thereby their"
"evidence  should  not  be  relied  upon  was  legally  untenable.  It  was  his  position"
"that their evidence should have been considered in favour of the appellant and"
"not in the way the learned High Court Judge considered them."
"It was the view of the learned Counsel for the respondent, that independently to"
"the  evidence  of  PW-07  and  08,  the  prosecution  has  proved  the  case  beyond"
"reasonable doubt against the appellant. It was her view that the learned High"
"Court Judge was correct in deciding to disregard the evidence of PW-07 and 08."
"Relying on the provisions of Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance and decided"
"cases of our Superior Courts, it was the position of the learned Counsel that even"
"the evidence of one solitary witness is sufficient in a criminal trial if that evidence"
"is cogent and trustworthy. It was also her position that the evidence of PW-01"
"has been well corroborated by PW-02 and when considering the evidence in its"
"totality, the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt against"
"the appellant."
