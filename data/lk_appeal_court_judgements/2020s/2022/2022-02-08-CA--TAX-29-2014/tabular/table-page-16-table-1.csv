"In  Nanayakkara  v.  University  of  Peradeniya 
[1991]  (1)  SLR  97,  S.N."
"Silva,J, (as he then was)held that;"
"‘
The Stamp Duty Act imposes a pecuniary burden on the people. Therefore"
"i
t
 is subject to the rule of strict construction. (Maxwell on interpretation of"
"statutes., 12th Edition page 256). In the case of Cape Brandy Syndicate vs. I.R.C,"
"Rowlatt J stated as follows:"
"“In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said.  There is no"
"room  for  any  intendment.  There  is  no  equity  about  a  tax.  There  is  no"
"presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One"
"can only look fairly at the language used.”’"
"In Vallibel Lanka (Pvt.) Limited v. Director General of Customs and three"
"others, [2008] 1 SLR 219 Sripavan J. (as he then was) held;"
"“It is the established rule in the interpretation of statutes that levy taxes"
"and duties, not to extend the provisions of the statute by implication, beyond the"
"c
l
ear import of the language used or to enlarge their operation in order to"
"embrace matters not specifically pointed out. In case of doubt, the provisions are"
"construed most strongly against the state and in favour of the citizen."
"T
he court cannot give a wider interpretation to Section 16 [of the Customs"
"Ordinance]………….  merely  because  some  financial  loss  may  in  certain"
"c
i
rcumstances be caused to the state. Considerations of hardship, injustice or"
"anomalies do not play any useful role in construing fiscal statutes.”"
"For the foregoing reasons, the opinion of this Court is that all questions of"
"law raised in this case should be answered in favour of the Appellant."
