"‘Judges, whether trial or appellate, should review their drafts to minimize, if not eliminate,"
"all dicta not pertinent to the outcome or not true to principle. As Mansfield CJ put it in 1772,"
"“I  care  not  for  the  supposed  dicta  of  judges,  however  eminent,  if  they  be  contrary  to  all"
"principle.”2  Obiter  dicta  can  also  hurt  the  system  by  being  misread  as  part  of  rationes"
"decidendi. So judges must resist the lure of the literary or philosophical frolic. Reserve your"
"beloved but impertinent adages, examples, maxims, parables, poetry, quotable quotes and"
"stories for your forthcoming memoirs. Never mind how your decision would have read if the"
"facts had been different. Solve the problem before you. “Avoid wondering off on hypotheticals"
"or addressing issues that go beyond resolving the case. Doing so will lead readers to incorrect"
"interpretation and unwelcome dicta”3’"
