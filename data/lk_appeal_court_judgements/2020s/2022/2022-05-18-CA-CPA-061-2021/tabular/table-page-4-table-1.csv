"had arrested 10 people on the vessel with narcotics in hand. Thereafter,"
"three more suspects have been arrested from Sri Lankan shores by the"
"PNB  Officers  on  29/02/2020.  Thereafter,  further 
investigations  have"
"been  done  and 
instant  suspect  had  been  taken 
into  custody  upon"
"surrendering himself on 05/03/2020 to the PNB Officers and produced"
"before 
the  Magistrate.  But 
the  said  B  report  does  not  carry  any"
"independent  evidence  against  him  other 
than 
the  material 
in  his"
"statement which is inadmissible under the Evidence Ordinance and the"
"narration by the PNB officers of the raid."
"The counsel appearing for the Attorney general stated that, under the"
"circumstances upon which the instant rade has been carried out, it is not"
"practical  to  be  divulging  all  information  in  a  B  report.  But,  this  Court"
"draws its attention  to  Section 115(1) of the  Criminal  Procedure  Code,"
"according to which “… the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station or the"
"inquirer 
shall 
forth 
with 
forward 
the 
suspect 
to 
the"
"Magistrate…together with a summary of the statement if any made by"
"each  of  the  witnesses  examined  in  the  course  of  such  investigation"
"related to the case”. Therefore, the Section is very clear to say that, the"
"Magistrate has to have material before him when a suspect is produced"
"before him. Section 115(2) further says very clearly that, “the Magistrate"
"before whom a suspect is produced under this Section, if he is satisfied"
"that it is expedient to detain the suspect in custody…” therefore, the"
"law 
is  very  clear  that  the  Magistrate  should  be  furnished  with  the"
"evidence  recorded  against  the  suspect  who  is  being  produced  before"
"him. Therefore, the investigating officers must submit a summary of the"
"statements recorded if any for the Magistrate to ascertain any reason if"
"any, to remand the suspect. This same issue has been discussed by this"
