"Analyzing the jurisprudence developed by Courts in this area, I take the view that it is the"
"duty of the Petitioner who seeks judicial review to establish that the alternative remedy is"
"not adequate and efficacious. Further, I am of the view that if the impugned order is a"
"blatant miscarriage of justice or is ex-facie wrong and if rights of a party are also involved,"
"this Court can entertain an application even when an alternative remedy is available."
"The function of this Court in the instant application is to decide whether the impugned"
"order of the learned Magistrate should be set aside on the principles applicable to judicial"
"review including the requirement of exhaustion of other remedies."
"In the instant application the right under Section 14 of the Act is a statutory remedy made"
"available to the Petitioner. When the Parliament provides right of appeal, generally the"
"aggrieved party should first exercise such rights before seeking judicial review. Whenever"
"a  party  is  dissatisfied  with  an  order  of  a  Court  of  first  instance, such party  cannot  seek"
"judicial review as a right against such order without first recoursing to an appeal or revision"
"and that is to avoid the abuse of judicial process. However, if there is an error in the nature"
"of  blatant  miscarriage  of  justice  as  mentioned  above,  an  application  may  be  made  for"
"judicial review against the impugned order."
"Along  with  the  above  observations,  attention  needs  to  be  drawn  to  the  basic  principles"
"involved in judicial review apart from the principles laid down in Council of Civil Service"
"Unions  vs.  Minister  for  the  Civil  Service [1985]  AC  374  (at  p.  408)  (GCHQ  case)  by  Lord"
