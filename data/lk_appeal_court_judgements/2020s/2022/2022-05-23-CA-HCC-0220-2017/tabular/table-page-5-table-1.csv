"at different points of the trial, which appears to be the reason for the learned"
"High Court Judge to reject his defence of sudden fight and finding him guilty"
"as charged."
"It  was  the  position  of  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG)  for  the"
"respondent that although there is evidence to suggest that this was a result"
"of a sudden fight, he is supporting the conviction mainly based on the injuries"

"Having considered the submissions made by the learned President’s Counsel"
"on  behalf  of  the  appellant,  as  well  as  the  learned  DSG  on  behalf  of  the"
