"two main grounds of appeal on behalf of the appellant."
"1.  There was no fair trial afforded to the appellant and hence, the conviction"
"and the sentence cannot stand."
"2.  The  evidence  placed  before  the  Court  clearly  establishes  the  basis  for  a"
"conviction  for  culpable  homicide  not  amounting  to  murder  in  terms  of"
"exception 4 of Section 294 of the Penal Code on the basis of a sudden fight,"
"and  therefore  the  conviction  in  terms  of  Section  296  of  the  Penal  Code"
"cannot be sustained."
