"of  Section  297  of  the  Penal  Code,  although  he  agrees  that  the  incident  has"
"happened  as  a  result  of  a  sudden  fight.  Justifying  his  position,  it  was  his"
"contention that the medical evidence shows 18 injuries to the deceased out of"
"which injuries 2 to 7 are necessarily fatal cut injuries and also the fact that the"
"deceased had been attacked from behind."
"He  further  points  out  that  the  medical evidence  shows  the  injuries  have  been"
"inflicted by using excessive force where it should have not been the case if it was"
"a sudden fight happened at the spur of the moment. Hence, the clear intention"
"of the appellant to kill the deceased has been established."
"As I have discussed before, the evidence of the prosecution witnesses itself shows"
"that  the  deceased  and  the  appellant  had  no  previous  enmity  between  them,"
"although the appellant in his evidence has stated that the deceased was in the"
"habit  of  demanding  ransoms  during  the  weekend  in  the  form  of  liquor  and"
"cigarettes."
"The evidence shows that on the day of the incident, they were consuming liquor"
"and enjoying. There is no evidence to show any premeditation by the appellant"
"to  attack  the  deceased.  The  only  conclusion  that  can  be  reached  under  the"
"circumstances  is  that  the  incident  was  a  result  of  a  sudden  quarrel  and  the"
"attack has been a result of the heat of passion."
"There  is  no  evidence  to  show  that  the  appellant  took  undue  advantage  as"
"evidence  shows  that  he  took  something  that  was  available  in  the  vicinity  and"
"attacked the deceased, although there was no evidence as to who brought the"
"sharp cutting weapon to the place where they were consuming liquor."
"It is correct that the deceased has received 18 injuries to his body, but that in"
"itself is not a reason to conclude that the appellant acted in a cruel or unusual"
"manner. It is quite possible for a person to keep on attacking another due to a"
"sudden emotion or passion that arises between the attacker and the attacked."
