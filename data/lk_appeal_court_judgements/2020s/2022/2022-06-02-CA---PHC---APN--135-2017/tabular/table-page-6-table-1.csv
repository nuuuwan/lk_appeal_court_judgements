"The 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and the 6th respondents had been sentenced according to the"
"culpability of each one of them but had failed state the basis upon which the plea"
"had been entered. But this Court notes that that the High Court Judge had heard the"
"evidence led against both parties in its entirety and had considered the submissions"
"of  both  parties  oral  and  written  both  and  has  proceeded  to  sentence  without"
"mentioning the basis upon which the charged had been amended. As such this Court"
"is of the opinion that it has not caused any prejudice to either party."
"It has been held in the case of Lional vs. OIC Meetiyagoda Police Station 1987 (1) SLR"
"210 and in the case of Edwin Singno vs. Jayasinghe 48 NLR 349 that if there is no"
"failure of justice, minor irregularities are curable under provisions of the CPC. The"
"chapter which deals with the irregularities in the proceedings in COC is in chapter"
"XXX1X  and  section  436  specifically  deals  with  error  omission  and  irregularity  in"
"proceedings."
"As such in view of the cases cited above this Court is of the opinion that the failure"
"on the part of the High Court Judge to mention the basis upon which he has accepted"
"the basis under Section 297 of the Penal Code, it has not caused any prejudice to"
"either party as per circumstances mentioned above."
"As  such  this  Court  sees  no  exceptional  reason  to  set  aside  the  order  of  the  High"
"Court, hence the instant application for revision is hereby dismissed."
