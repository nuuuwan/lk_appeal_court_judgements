"Hence it is to be construed from the submission of the petitioner that the High Court"
"Judge  has  acted  in  the  best  interests  of  justice  in  accepting  the  plea  for  a  lesser"
"offence sans the sanction of the Attorney General."
"Gunasekara J in Attorney General vs Mendi’s (1995) 1 Sri L.R 138 was of the opinion"
"that “once an accused is found guilty and convicted on his own plea, or after trial, the"
"Trial Judge has a difficult function to perform. That is to decide what sentence is to be"
"imposed on the accused who has been convicted. In doing so he has to consider the"
"point of view of the accused on the one hand and the interest of society on the other."
"In doing so the Judge must necessarily consider the nature of the offence committed,"
"the manner in which it has been committed the machinations and the manipulations"
"resorted to by the accused to commit the offence, the effect of committing such a crime"
"in so far as the institution or organization in respect of which it has been committed,"
"the  persons  who  are  affected  by  such  crime,  the  ingenuity  with  which  it  has  been"
"committed and the involvement of  others in committing the  crime.  The Trial Judge"
"who  has  the  sole  discretion  in  imposing  a  sentence  which  is  appropriate  having"
"regard to the criteria set out above should in our view not to surrender this sacred"
"right and duty to any other person, be it counsel or accused or any other person."
"Further he went on to state that whilst plea bargaining is permissible in our view,"
"sentence bargaining should not be encouraged at all and must be frowned upon”. It"
"is safe to say  that this view still remains as  a fundamental aspect of this court and"
"sentence bargaining is still something that is to be frowned upon."
"The Counsel for the petitioner further submitted that if one may go through the facts"
"of the case the sentence imposed on the respondents are grossly inadequate. But"
"this Court notes that the High Court Judge has heard the entirety of the evidence"
"against  both  parties  and  had  considered  the  submissions  of  both  parties 
in"
"sentencing  the  respondents.  Therefore  this  Court 
is  unable  to  agree  with  the"
"contention regarding the inadequacy of the sentence."
"But this Court is in agreement with the submissions of the petitioner that the High"
"Court Judge has not stated on what basis he is accepting the plea of guilt for a lesser"
"offence, which this Court asserts is an illegality in the conclusion of the High Court"
"Judge, and this Court has to consider whether it has caused any prejudice to either"
"party."
"In  the 
instant  matter  the  High  Court  Judge  had  acquitted  the  3rd  respondent"
"considering  the  evidence  against  him  which  of  only  participatory  nature  and  him"
"being below 15 years of age at the time of the offence."
