"clearly that if the accused puts forward a plea of guilt  for a lesser offence the Judge"
"and  the Attorney General both has to be satisfied with the plea of the accused but"
"if  the  accused  does  not  plead  to  a  lesser  offence  the  trial  must  commence  and"
"proceed which means that  it is  at  the very beginning  and  not when  the  trial has"
"commenced that the sanction of the Attorney General is required, the proceeding"
"sections  are   very  clear  on  this.(  Section  198  and  199(1)).  At  this  point  this  Court"
"thinks it’s most fit to quote Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes at page 47 where"
"it has been stated that “a statute is to be read as a whole….to make a consistent"
"enactment  of  the  whole  statute”.  Therefore,  instead  of  an  isolated  reading  of"
"Section  197  of  the  CPC,  one  must  read  the  Section  from  195  and  onwards  to"
"understand the meaning of Section 197 of the CPC."
"Further to above in cases where it is a before jury also it has been said that at the"
"very commencement of the trial when the accused is brought before Court at very"
"commencement of the trial as per Section 205 of the CPC that “if the accused pleads"
"guilty to the indictment or a lesser offence …. the provision of the Section 197 of the"
"CPC shall apply”."
"Therefore, according to the provisions set out in the CPC commencing from Section"
"195 onwards up to Section 207 or so, it is at the very commencement of the trial that"
"the sanction of the Attorney General is needed for Court to accept a plea."
"Another argument taken up by the Counsel for the petitioner is that, in the instant"
"matter  the  respondents  have  been  charged  with  murder  and  if  the  respondents"
"were to plead for a lesser offence the indictment needs to be amended, which has"
"to be done by the Attorney General."
"The  provisions  pertaining  to  amendment  of  indictment  is  at  Section  167  of  the"
"CPC,   which  reads  as  “Any  Court  may  alter  any  indictment  or  charge  at  any  time"
"before  judgment  is  pronounced  …..,”,  which  does  not  speak  of  a  sanction  of  the"
"Attorney General to amend the charge, the proceeding Sections are very clear that"
"if Court thinks it is fit to charge and convict the accused for an offence other than for"
"what he has been indicted for Court may do so at any time before the judgment is"
"pronounced subject to the provisions of sections 168 to 171 of the CPC.."
"Therefore,  this  Court  is  unable  to  agree  with  the  above  two  contentions  of  the"
"petitioner."
"In the written submissions filed by the Counsel for the petitioner it has cited the case"
"of CA(APN)105/14, where it has been stated that in the interest of justice that the"
"Court can override the discretion of the State Counsel and amend the indictment ex"
"mere motto."
