"For the above reasons, it is considered the view of this Court, since"
"the  appellant  has  failed  to  dispense  the  burden  cast  on  her,  that"
"the learned Magistrate has duly concluded the matter at hand and"
"the learned High Court Judge has correctly dismissed the revision"
"application.  Accordingly,  we  see  no  reason  to  interfere  with  the"
"order of  the  learned High  Court  Judge  dated  24.10.2016  and  the"
"confiscation order of the learned Magistrate dated 16.12. 2015."
"The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs."
