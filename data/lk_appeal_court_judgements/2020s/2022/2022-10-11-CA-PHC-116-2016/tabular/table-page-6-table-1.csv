"on him by the Forest Ordinance."
"It was the contention of the appellant that, she was uninformed of"
"the said  diversion  of the vehicle. The appellant admitted that  she"
"has given the vehicle to the accused to be serviced and until such"
"time of notification of the arrest, the appellant was unaware of the"
