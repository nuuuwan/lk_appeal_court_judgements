"vehicle for illegal activities. However, the cross examination of the"
"appellant,  revealed  that  the  vehicle  has  been  engaged  in  a  prior"
"offence  where  the  accused  has  diverted  the  vehicle  and  gotten"
"arrested for the illegal transportation of sand. Therefore, it further"
"cements  the  observation  of  this  Court,  that  a  mere  exchange  of"
"instructions to the accused, does not suffice the burden cast on her,"
"the fact that the accused is the appellant’s son and that there is a"
"record  of  a  prior  offence,  imputes  a  duty  upon  the  appellant  to"
"closely monitor the use of the vehicle by the accused and to take all"
"precautions  to  prevent  the  commission  of  such  an  offence,  as  a"
"reasonably responsible person in ownership of a vehicle, in order to"
"satisfy this Court."
"As held in S. D. N. Premasiri v Officer In Charge, Mawathagama"
"C A (PHC) 46/2015 Court of Appeal Minute dated 27.11.2018"
"“…it  is  imperative  to  prove  to  the  satisfaction  of  Court  that  the"
"vehicle owner in question has not only given instructions but also"
"has taken every possible step to implement them”. It is observed by"
"this Court that, in this instant application, the appellant has proved"
"neither."
"Similarly, 
in  H.G.Sujith  Priyantha 
v  O.I.C.Police  Station,"
"Poodala  C.A  (PHC)  No  157/12,  it  was  held  that  mere  verbal"
"instructions to the driver on the conduct of employing the vehicle"
"does not suffice to dispense the burden cast on him, on a balance"
"of probability. As such, in this instant matter, this Court observes"
"that the appellant has not properly dispensed the burden of proving"
"on a balance of probability, the burden cast on him to constitute,"
"to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Court  that  she  has  taken  all  necessary"
"precautions 
to  prevent 
the  commission  of  an  offence,  as  a"
"responsible owner of a vehicle."
