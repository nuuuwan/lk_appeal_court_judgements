"the “20th Defendant-Appellant” (the Appellant) in the caption to the Petition of Appeal"
"was not a party to the partition action. The 1st and 2nd Plaintiff-Respondents instituted"
"the  partition  action  for  partitioning  the  land  known  as  Davatagahahena  which  is"
"morefully described in the schedule to the plaint. After the statements of claim of the"
"Defendant-Respondents were tendered to the Court, the case had been fixed for trial"
"and upon conclusion of the trial on 10.10.1994, a date has given to tender the documents"
"marked at the trial and the list of shares which the parties were entitled. When the case"
"was called before the open court on 23.11.1994 for that purpose, the Appellant made"
"an application to add him as a party to the action. The Court allowed that application,"
"subject to a pre-payment of costs to the parties to the action and given a date to pay the"
"pre-paid costs. On the date which the pre-paid costs had to be paid, the Appellant did"
"not pay it and the Court, therefore, did not add him as a party to the action. Thereafter,"
"the learned District Judge delivered the judgment allotting shares to the parties to the"
"action and the Appellant did not get any share/right in the land sought to be partitioned."
"Then he preferred this  Appeal against the judgment seeking reliefs, inter alia, to set"
"aside the judgment of the District Court and an order for a re-trial."
"After hearing the Appeal, this Court concluded that the Attorney-at-Law who filed the"
"proxy for the 1st and 2nd Plaintiff-Respondents in the District Court had failed to file the"
"Declaration under section 12 of the Partition Act, No. 21 of 1977 (the Partition Act)."
"On that basis the judgment of the District Court was set aside ordering a trial de novo."
"The 1st and 2nd Plaintiff-Respondents sought special leave to appeal from the Supreme"
"Court against that judgment of this Court dated 07.01.2019. Before the Supreme Court,"
"the learned Counsel appeared for the parties submitted to Court that even though, the"
"learned  Counsel  had  inadvertently  made  submissions  at  the  hearing  of  the  Appeal"
"before this Court on the basis that the section 12 Declaration had not been filed, in fact"
"it  had  been  filed.  Accordingly,  the  Supreme  Court  set  aside  the  judgment  dated"
"07.01.2019 of this Court and the case record had been sent back to this Court to consider"
"the matters set out in the Petition of Appeal dated 27.10.1995 on the merits."
