"When the Appeal was taken up for hearing, the learned President’s Counsel appearing"
"for  the  Appellant,  admitting  that  the  Appellant  who  was  not  a  party  to  the  partition"
"action is not entitle to invoke appellate jurisdiction of this Court and that the appeal is"
"misconceived in law, invited the Court to consider the Appeal as a Revision Application"
"and grant reliefs prayed for in the Petition of Appeal."

"party by the court itself. According to the learned President’s Counsel, non-addition of"
"the Appellant as a party to the action, though, he had preferred a claim to the land sought"
"to  be  partitioned  before  the  Surveyor,  is  a  miscarriage  of  justice  and  this  Court,"
