"The position of the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel appeared for the Appellant is that the"
"Appellant is a co-owner of the land sought be partitioned and his title deed to the land"
"should have been considered by the learned District Judge. Nevertheless, that deed has"
"not been tendered to the Court at the trial. Therefore, the learned District Judge had no"
"opportunity to consider that deed. Considering the documentary and oral evidence of"
"the case placed before the Court at the trail, the learned District Judge has decided the"
"rights of the parties."
"When considering all the above stated facts and circumstances, this Court cannot be"
"satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has been caused to the Appellant and a situation"
"which  shocks  the  conscience  of  the  Court  has  been  arisen  to  interfere  with  the"
"proceedings  and/or  the  judgment  of  the  District  Court  for  the  due  administration  of"
"justice. Therefore,  I hold that the Appellant has failed to satisfy Court that it should"
"exercise  the  revisionary  jurisdiction.  Therefore,  I  dismiss  the  appeal  and  affirm  the"
"judgment dated 30.08.1995 of the District Court. I direct the learned District Judge to"
"enter the interlocutory decree according to that judgment."
