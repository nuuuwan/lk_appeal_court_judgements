"District Court, allow the Appellant to tender his statement of claim and order for a re-"
"trial."
"It is borne out from the case record in the District Court that the Appellant whose name"
"is mentioned in the Surveyor’s report as a claimant has been served with a notice in"
"terms of section 16 (4) and thereafter, on the direction of the Court by the Fiscal in term"
"of section 20 (1) (a) of the Partition Act (as amended)."
"Sub-section (1) of section 20 states thus;"
"“The court shall order notice of a partition action to be sent by registered post-"

"defendant in the action”."

"“Any person receiving notice under subsection (1) of this section shall not be added as"
"a party to the action unless he applies by motion in writing to be added on or before"

"such party applies by way of a motion in writing to add him as a party to the action."

"Even  though,  the  notices  have  been  served  on  the  Appellant  by  the  Surveyor  and"
"through the Court he has not honoured the notices. Furthermore, the learned District"
"Court Judge has allowed the Appellant’s belated application to add him as a party to"
