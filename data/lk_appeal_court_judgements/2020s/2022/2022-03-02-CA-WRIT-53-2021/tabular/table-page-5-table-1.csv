"P
etitioners in the prayer of the petition seek for Orders in the nature of Writ of Mandamus"
"directing  Respondents  to  perform  their  statutory  and  regulatory  duties  under  various"
"sections of several statues, which in our view is a very broad plea to be made in this kind"
"of judicial review application."
"I
n our view such reliefs always should combine with an actual incident or with a live fact"
"especially in a judicial review application since this Court makes Orders of specific nature"
"as empowered under Article 140 of the Constitution.  Further, such Orders should be in"
"relation to a specific decision or act of the authorities identified carefully in the pleadings."
"I
t is not for this Court to consider whether the public authority is right or wrong but the"
"role of this Court is to consider whether the public authority has exceeded their powers. I"
"have  observed  in  my  Order  dated  03.02.2022  in  CA/WRIT/45/2022  that  this  Court"
"cannot be the Judge of giving directions to a Government intervening to the role of ruling"
"the country."
"I
n the circumstances, we are of the unanimous view that none of the reliefs prayed for in"
"the prayer of the petition could be granted even after a full hearing of this case due to the"
"ill-fated mode of formulating the prayer of the petition of the Petitioner."
"T
herefore, we are not inclined to issue notice on the Respondents and we proceed to refuse"
"this application."
