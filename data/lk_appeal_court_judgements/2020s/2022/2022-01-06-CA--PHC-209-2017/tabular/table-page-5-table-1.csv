"“As  stated  earlier,  the  mere  pendency  of  a  suit  in  a  civil  Court  is  an  irrelevant"
"circumstance for the Magistrate to take into consideration when making an order"
"under Section 62 and 63 of the Administration of Justice Law. His primary function"
"is to maintain Law and order. If the mere institution of a suit in a civil Court is"
"sufficient to divest the Magistrate of his jurisdiction, the whole purpose of Section"
"62 will be defeated. A scheming party will be enabled to play hide and seek”."
