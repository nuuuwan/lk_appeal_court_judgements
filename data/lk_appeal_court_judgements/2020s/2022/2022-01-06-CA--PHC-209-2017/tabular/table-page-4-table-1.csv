"According to the statement made by the Appellant, the roadway leading to his residence was only"
"used by him and the actual access to the land was from the other side of the land and that was the"
"access used by the Respondent to gain access to the premises occupied by her."
"O
n behalf of the Appellant, it was submitted that a partition action bearing No. 28904/P is pending"
"in the District Court of Kegalle in respect of the premises in dispute, where the preliminary plan"
"too had been prepared."
"I
t was further submitted that the Respondent was present before the surveyor at the preliminary"
"survey but the Respondent had not claimed any right of way over the disputed roadway nor had"
"she preferred any counter claim when the appellant claimed that the said roadway was exclusively"
"a road to access his portion of land."
"M
oreover, the Appellant submitted that since the District Court action was pending at the time the"
"dispute arose between the parties, the Respondent could not have maintained the instant action and"
"also the learned Magistrate could not have assumed jurisdiction to hear and determine the said"
"Case."
"O
n  this  premise,  it  was  the  position  taken  up  by  the  Appellant  that  the  said  Order  in  terms  of"
"Section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act is made until such time a Court with competent"
"civil jurisdiction makes a final Order in relation to a civil dispute between the parties in order to"
"prevent a breach of the peace."
"S
ince  there  was  already  a  civil  action  pending  in  the  District  Court  at  the  time  of  instituting"
"proceedings under Chapter VII of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act,  the Respondent  was not"
"without recourse to obtain any relief from that Court which has jurisdiction to grant suitable relief."
"T
he attention of Court was drawn to the following Case law in view of the aforesaid submissions"
"made by and on behalf of the Appellant;"
"In Kanagasabai Vs. Mylvaganam 78 N.L.R 280 at 284 - Sharvananda J. as his Lordship’s then"
"was held,"
