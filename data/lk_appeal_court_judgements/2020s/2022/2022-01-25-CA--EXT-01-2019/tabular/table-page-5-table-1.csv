"made submissions on the claim that the initiation of proceedings against the appellant"
"amounts to double jeopardy as $ 30,000 Australian Dollars have already been recovered"
"from the appellant. It was his contention that moving for extradition amounts to double"
"jeopardy in a context where a penalty has already been imposed on the appellant. In"
"concluding,  the  President’s  Counsel  for  the  appellant  stated  that  the  offence  was"
"allegedly committed in 2006 and the purported warrant was only issued in 2009 which"
"pointed to an irregularity in the procedure adopted by the Australian Authorities and"
"contended  whether  a  citizen  of  Sri  Lanka  should  be  handed  over  to  a  foreign  nation"
"under such irregular circumstances."
"On  behalf  of  the  respondent,  the  Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG)  argued  that  the"
"impugned order cannot be challenged by way of an appeal as it is not in the nature of a"
"final  order,  asserting that  a  right  of  appeal  has  not  been  conferred  against  the  order"
"dated  23.08.2019.  Elaborating  on  the  same  it  was  contended  that  the  inquiry  is  still"
"pending  before  the  High  Court  yet  to  be  concluded  and  as  such  the  impugned  order"
"does not fall within the definition of a ‘final order’. It was submitted that the appellant"
"has filed a revision application against the same impugned order and such application"
"has  been  duly  dismissed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal,  against  which  the  appellant  has"
"proceeded to the Supreme Court. To buttress this argument several case law precedents"
"were  referred  to  by  the  DSG.  It  was  the  contention  of  the  DSG  that  the  appellant  is"
"necessarily inviting the Court of Appeal to pass judgment on the merit of the case when"
"the same is pending before the High Court and that all facts and circumstances related"
"to  the  legality  or  otherwise  of  the  warrant,  issue  of  double  jeopardy  will  have  to  be"
"determined  at  the  said  inquiry.  It  was  further  submitted  that  the  appellant  has  not"
"exhausted alternate remedies such as the writ jurisdiction to impugn the decision of the"
"Minister to issue an Authority to Proceed against the appellant."
"Having thus set out the factual background which transpired before court in terms of"
"submissions  from  both  parties,  this  Court  will  firstly  examine  the  legal  provisions"
"pertinent to the instant matter."
