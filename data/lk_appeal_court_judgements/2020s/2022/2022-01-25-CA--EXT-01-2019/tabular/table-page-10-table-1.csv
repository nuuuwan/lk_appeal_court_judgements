"no right of appeal lies. Though the document marked in page 71-73 of the appeal brief"
"reads  as  its  title  ‘judgment’  the  impugned  order  is  not  a  final  order,  but  a  mere"
"dispensation  of  an objection  raised  by  the  appellant  to  the  proceedings.  The  Learned"
"High Court Judge in his “judgment” dated 23.08.2019 at page 3 held as follows: ‘Due to"
"the  above-mentioned  reasons,  preliminary  objections  raised  by  the  Respondent  are"
"overruled. I order to proceed with the matter’.  In this regard reference can be made to"
"SC  Appeal  No  41/2-15  and  SC/CHC  Appeal  37/2008  SC  Minute  dated  04.08.2017"
"which was heard before a bench comprising of 6 Justices presided over by His Lordship,"
"Chief  Justice  Priyasath  Dep  PC.  Both  applications  dealt  with  this  judgment  involved"
"questions of  law identical to each other where sections  754(1)  and 754(2) of the Civil"
"Procedure  Code  was  discussed.  Determining  on  the  proper  mechanism  for  filing  an"
"appeal,  the  said  judgment  upheld  the  finding  that  no  right  of  appeal  lies  against  an"
"interlocutory order. In any event, there is no right of appeal specifically provided under"
"the Extradition Law of Sri Lanka, but Section 11 of the Act provides for the review of the"
"order of the committal in an instance where an application is being made to the Court"
"of Appeal for a mandate in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus, as explained above."
"With reference to the ‘grounds’ alleged by the appellant, it is the considered view of this"
"Court that the same ought to be determined in the inquiry before the High Court and"
"the present application amounts to a premature attempt by the appellant to challenge"
"the final determination of the High Court. As such, the averments on double jeopardy"
"and  reference  to  procedural  irregularities  in  the  issuance  of  the  warrant  will  not  be"
"determined by this Court."
"Furthermore, this Court holds that the impugned order has rightly held that it has no"
"jurisdiction  to  determine  on  the  discretion  exercised  by  the  Minister  in  issuing  the"
"Authority to Proceed. As clearly set out in the applicable law, the scope of jurisdiction"
"of the High Court in the instant matter is limited to examine whether an extraditable"
"offence has been committed and whether or not the appellant should be committed to"
"custody awaiting extradition. This inquiry is yet to be concluded by the High Court and"
"we see no reason to interfere with the ongoing processes pending against the appellant"
"in the High Court."
