"raids  during  the  day  before  the  arrest  of  the  appellant  in  the  raid  relevant  to"
"this case. It has been revealed that the same team of officers led by PW-01 has"
"left  the  PNB  at  11.00  a.m.  for  the  first  raid  for  the  day  and  had  arrested  a"
"person  called  Dharmasiri  with  500  grams  of  Heroin  in  his  possession.  When"
"suggested that it was not probable for a same team of officers to conduct raids"
"in that manner, the PW-01 has come out that in fact he and his team of same"
"officers returned to the PNB only at 10.35 a.m., after leaving at 10.40 a.m. on"
"the  previous  day,  after  an  unsuccessful  raid.  Although  this  fact  has  been"
"revealed  by  the  witness  to  show  that  there  can  be  several  raids  in  a  day,  this"
"also reveals that the team has left the PNB only 25 minutes from their return to"
"the Bureau, after been out on duty for 24 hours."
"Although it may be possible for a dedicated team of specially trained officers to"
"work in this manner as argued correctly by the learned DSG, in my view, what"
"needs to be considered is whether it may be the truth or any other assumption"
"also  possible  given  the  facts  and  the  circumstances  of  the  case,  after  giving"
"consideration to the totality of the evidence."
"In  that  context,  I  find  it  was  rather  strange  for  the  PW-01  to  say  that  he"
"reported to duty at 8.00 a.m. on the day of the incident, which was not correct"
"according to his own  evidence.  I  find it questionable as to why the PW-01 did"
"not take steps to search the house of Dharmasiri when he was found with 500"
"grams of Heroin as it was the normal practice of the PNB to investigate further"
"when a person is found with such a  quantity  of Heroin. I am  of the view that"
"there  was  a  duty  by  the  witness  to  explain  as  to  why  he  did  not  follow  the"
"normal  practice  on  this  occasion.  I  find  that  the  prosecution  cannot  get  away"
"from  their  responsibility  of  eliminating  this  type  of  reasonable  doubts,  as  the"
"defence of the appellant was that part of the Heroin found in the possession of"
"Dharmasiri  was  introduced  to  him  after  getting  him  down  to  the  house  of"
"Dharmasiri."
