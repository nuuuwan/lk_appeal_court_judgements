"At this juncture I am also reminded of the legal maxim known as Blackstone’s"
"Formulation which says that “It is better that ten guilty persons should escape"
"than  one  innocent  suffer”,  which  is  based  on  the  essential  principle  of  our"
"criminal  law  that  a  criminal  charge  has  to  be  established  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt."
"(See- Glanville Williams, Proof of Guilt, 3rd Edition, 186-190)"
"It is my considered view that if considered in the correct perspective, there was"
"sufficient  basis  for  the  Court  to  conclude  that  the  appellant  has  created  a"
"reasonable  doubt  with  regard  to  the  evidence  adduced  by  the  prosecution"
"which should have been considered in favour of him."
"For  the  reasons  as  stated  above,  I  am  unable  to  agree  with  the  reasoning  for"
"the  finding  of  the  appellant  guilty  for  the  possession  of  Heroin  by  the  learned"
"High Court Judge. I am of the view that it was not safe to convict the appellant"
"given the infirmities of the evidence of the prosecution."
"Accordingly, I set aside the conviction and the sentence dated 26-04-2018, as it"
"cannot be allowed to stand, and acquit the appellant of the charge for which he"
"was found guilty."
"Appeal allowed."
