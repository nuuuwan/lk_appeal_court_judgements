"There is a paramount duty casted upon the Trial Judge to evaluate the evidence of a case in"
"its entirety which is a part of a fair trial. Such is guaranteed to every person by Article 13(3) of"
"the  Constitution  of  the  Democratic  Socialist-Republic  of  Sri  Lanka.  The  Learned  Trial  Judge"
"should  not  use  the  demeanour  and  deportment  of  a  witnesses  to  buttress  the  weak"
"testimony of a witness. Eyewitness, the evidence PW 01 is inconsistent and weak due to the"

"the evidence of PW 01 and thus deprived the Accused of a fair trial."

"In  the  light  of  above-mentioned  circumstances,  there  is  a  reasonable  doubt  created  with"

"acquitted from the charge of murder."
"The prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and that the conviction"
"and  the  sentence  imposed  on  the  1st  accused-appellant  cannot  stand.  Owing  to  the  above"
"circumstances, this Court is of the view that the learned  Trial Judge has lamentably failed in"
"evaluating the entirety of the evidence that was before him and therefore, the conviction of"
"the 1st accused-appellant is quashed."
"The case against the accused-appellants were not proven beyond reasonable doubt and the"
"conviction is not within the well-established principles of law as enumerated above. On the"
"premises aforementioned, this Court sets aside the judgment dated 20.07.2015, whereby the"
"1st accused-appellant was convicted and sentenced to death."
"Conviction and sentence quashed."
