"He further submitted that in an instance where a Chairman of an Urban Council submits"
"a  budget  or  a  supplementary  budget  under  section  169  of  the  Act  after  a  period  of  two"
"years from the commencement of the period of the office of the Council and then in an"
"event of the Council rejecting the budget in its entirety or part thereof and if the Chairman"
"then fails to have it duly passed within the stipulated time period, the Chairman of the"
"Pradeshiya  Sabha,  by  operation  of  the  law,  will  be  deemed  to  have  resigned  from  the"
"office."
"Rules."
"The  Petitioner  relies  upon  Rules  23  to  26  of  ‘P2’  which  has  been  promulgated  by  the"
"Western  Provincial  Council  and  the  1st  Respondent-Governor  and  submits  that  he  has"
"complied with all the provisions of those Rules and the Court of Appeal has not referred"
"to or taken in to consideration such Rules at the time of issuing the orders in the aforesaid"
"four cases."
"In  response  to  the  Petitioner’s  contentions  on  Rules,  the  Respondents  intimate  that"
"CA/Writ/24/2021 relates to the Katunayake Seeduwa Prasdeshiya Sabha which is more"
"or  less  similar  to  Katana  Prasdeshiya  Sabha  since  both  are  situated  in  the  Western"
"Province."
"It  is  well  observed  that  the  Rules  marked  ‘P2’  have  been  enforced  to  regularize  the"
"procedure for conducting business at meetings of Pradeshiya Sabha and to repeal Rules of"
"1998.  Therefore,  the  Rules  23  to  26  described  under  the  sub-heading  “Council  approval"
"relating  to  Budget  documents”  are  nothing  more  than  the  procedure  and  such  procedure"
"cannot possibly outweigh the relevant written law specifically mentioned in section 168"
"and section 169 of the Act. In Rule 28, the procedure in relation to voting and recording"
"of votes has been laid down and particularly prescribed how to conduct the voting when"
"the Pradeshiya Sabha expresses its consent or when a member calls for a division."
"The scope of section 168 & 169 of the Act"
"The  important  question  in  this  case  is  whether  the  Petitioner  is  entitled  to  declare  the"
"budget which was defeated by a majority as duly adopted under section 169  of the Act"
"based on the alleged reason that he had accepted the amendments proposed by Members."
"Further, it is essential to examine whether the Petitioner is deemed to have resigned from"
"the office of Chairman when he has failed to re-submit the budget for a vote."
