"It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that PW-01 relied"
"on by the prosecution was not a reliable and trustworthy witness as he was an"
"accomplice  to  the  crime.  Making  submissions  that  it  was  on  the  basis  of  the"
"evidence of PW-01 the appellant has been found guilty, it was her position such"
"a  conviction  was  not  safe  given  the  unreliable  nature  of  the  evidence.  It  was"
"stated  that  the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has 
failed  to  consider  material"
"contradictions  marked  as  relevant  and  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had  no"
"motive to kill his wife with whom he had a happy married life. Claiming that it"
"was  not  probable  for  the  appellant  to  kill  his  wife  and  take  her  jewellery,  sell"
"them and share the money with the other accused, it was her contention that"
"the  appellant  was  wrongly  convicted  and  he  should  stand  acquitted  of  the"
"charges."
"It  was  the  position  of  the  learned  Deputy  solicitor  General  (DSG)  on  behalf  of"
"the Attorney General that the case has been decided not only on the evidence"
"of the PW-01 who was an accomplice who was later given a conditional pardon"
"by 
the  Attorney  General,  but 
on 
the 
circumstantial 
evidence  as  well."
"Submitting that the evidence led in the action has clearly established that the"
"deceased  was  in  the  company  of  the  appellant  before  her  death,  it  was  the"
"position  of  the  learned  DSG  that  although  the  appellant  has  made  a  lengthy"
"statement  from  the  dock,  he  has  failed  to  explain  the  most 
incriminating"
"evidence against him to the Court."
"Contending  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  reached  his  verdict  after"
"well  considering  the  relevant 
legal  provisions  as  to  the  value  that  can  be"
"attached 
to 
the  evidence  of  an  accomplice  as  well  as 
the  circumstantial"
"evidence  made  available  to  the  Court,  it  was  his  position  that  the  conviction"
"and 
the 
sentence  needs  no  disturbance  and 
the  appeal 
should 
stand"
"dismissed."
