"i
nvited the court to  consider only a reduction of the 15 years jail term on the"
"grounds he urged."
"Section 365(B)(2)(b) reads as follows:"
"Commits grave sexual abuse on any person under eighteen years of age, shall be"
"punished  with  rigorous  imprisonment  for  a  term  not  less  than  seven  years  and"
"not  exceeding  twenty  years  and  with  fine  and  shall  also  be  ordered  to  pay"
"compensation of an amount determined by court to the person in respect of whom"
"the offence was committed for the injuries caused to such person;"
"The counsel for the appellant points out the following facts as grounds for the"
"reduction of the sentence:"
"1.  Counsel for the appellant informed the court prior to the commencement"
"of  the  trial  that  the  appellant  was  willing  to  plead  guilty  to  the  charge"
"(Vide proceedings of 31/3/2016). He also offered to pay compensation for"
"the victim. State Counsel who appeared for the Attorney General on that"
"day wanted time to consider the application."
"2.  The  appellant  had  the  opportunity  to  rape  the  victim,  which  he  did  not"
"commit  and  he  brought  back  the  victim  alive  to  the  house  where  she"
"lived.  Further he does not have any previous convictions."
"The  Learned  Deputy  Solictor  General  concedes  the  above  facts.  However,  she"
"points out the impact of the incident on the victimâ€™s life and how her marriage"
"life has become miserable after her husband came to know of this incident."
"As the appellant was ready to plead guilty and pay compensation prior to the"
"commencement  of  the  trial,  and  as  he  did  not  have  any  previous  convictions,"
