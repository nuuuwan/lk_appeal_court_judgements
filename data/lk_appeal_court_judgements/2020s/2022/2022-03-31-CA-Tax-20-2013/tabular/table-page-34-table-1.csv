"territorial  wastes  and  dumped  in  the  open  sea  (paragraph  36).  Another"
"illustration  is  where  goods  put  on  board  a  streamer  bound  for  a  foreign"
"country,  but  jettisoned  can  still  be  said  to  have  been  “exported”,  even"
"though they do not reach their destination (supra)."
"[94] The objective of granting the concessionary tax rates under Sections 42"
"or  52  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  as  regards  the  supply  of  bunker  fuel  to"
"foreign  going  ships  for  navigation  is  to  attract  foreign  going  ships  to  Sri"
"Lankan  ports  and  promote  bunkering  industry.  So  that  the  foreign  going"
"ships will visit the Ports of Sri Lanka and receive bunker fuel for navigation"
"on the high seas in the course of its journey to the next foreign destination"
"Port  and  the  suppliers  will  be  benefited  from  the  concessionary  tax  rates"
"under Section 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act."
"[95] The term 'export' in Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act signifies"
"etymologically 'to take out of Sri Lanka into the territory of another country,"
"and therefore, means to take out of Sri Lanka, goods to a territory of another"
"country. Now the term ""export "" for the purpose the taking bunker fuel out"
"of Sri Lanka means “taking out of Sri Lanka to any place (destination point)"
"in the high seas outside the territorial waters of Sri Lanka. In this sense, any"
"""place"" beyond the territorial waters of Sri Lanka would be a place outside"
"the country. The test is that the sending of the bunker fuel out of the country"
"is satisfied when the bunker fuel, which is directly delivered to the operator"
"/owner  of  the  foreign  going  vessel  for  navigation  on  the  high  seas  has  a"
"foreign destination point. The resulting position is that the ownership of the"
"bunker fuel will be transferred to the owner/operator of the vessel by the"
"supplier from a taxable activity and the vessel will use those bunker fuels for"
"navigation on the high seas intended for a foreign destination point out of"
"the Sri Lankan territorial waters (the next foreign port). In short, to earn the"
"exemption  or  concessionary  tax  rate,  the  goods  must  have  a  foreign"
"destination  point  where  they  can  be  said  to  be  taken  out  of  Sri  Lanka  to"
"constitute an export under Sections 42 or 52  of the Inland Revenue Act."
"[96] At the hearing, the learned Additional Solicitor-General submitted that"
"in order for a transaction to qualify as export, there should be a recipient for"
"such  goods  in  another  jurisdiction  as  an  importer  and  as  there  was  no"
"corresponding importer in another country to physically receive the goods,"
"the transition in the present case does not constitute an export. Bunker fuel"
