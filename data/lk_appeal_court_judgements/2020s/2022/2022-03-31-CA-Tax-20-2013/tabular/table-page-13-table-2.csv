"(28.02.2005 - CALHC), it was stated that"
"“Words used in a statute dealing with matters relating to the general"
"public are presumed to have been used in their popular rather than"
"narrow, legal or technical sense. The doctrine of Loquitur ut vulgus, i.e.,"
"according to the common understanding and acceptance of the terms, is"
"to be applied in construing the words used in statute dealing with"
"matters relating to the public in general. If an Act is directed to dealings"
"w
i
th matters affecting everybody generally, the words used, have the"
"meaning attached to them in the common and ordinary use of language”."
