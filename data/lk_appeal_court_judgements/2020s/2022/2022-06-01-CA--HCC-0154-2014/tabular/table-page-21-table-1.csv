"the  cherry  plant  had  been  broken  and  leaves  had  fallen  on the  slab  (X25,"
"X26, X27, X28). According to him his investigation revealed that the point"
"where the deceased had fallen is just straight below the bathroom window"
"and  the  fallen  cherry  plant  leaves  (X9,  X10).  According  to  PW29,  PW22  IP"
"Subasinghe  had  headed  the 
investigation  and  he  had  acted  upon  his"
"directions."
"PW40  had  confirmed  that  room  No.33  had  been  officially  allocated  to  the"
"Appellant. But she was unaware whether the wife of the Appellant was also"
