"In terms of Section 68 (3) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, if any person who had been in"
"possession of the land or part of it, has been forcibly dispossessed within a period of two months"
"immediately before the date on which the information was filed under Section 66 of the said Act,"
"it’s a duty cast on the learned Primary Court Judge, to make a determination to that effect and"
"make  an  order  directing  the  party  dispossessed  to  be  restored  to  possession  and  prohibit  all"
"disturbances  of  such  possession,  otherwise  than  under  the  authority  of  an  order  or  decree  of  a"
"competent court."
