"her,  the  following  portion  of  her  statement  to  the  police  had  been"
"marked as a contradiction (V-3): “චින්ත්‍ක එක්ක ආව සුරංග වනාවහාත් රුවන් යන"
"අය  මට  කරෙර  කළා  කියන්න  මම  ෙන්වන්  නැහැ”  (Page  96  of  the  appeal  brief)."
"Maybe  because  of  this  statement,  the  2nd  appellant  had  not  been"
"charged for committing the rape. The 3rd charge against the 2nd accused"
"for  committing  the  gang  rape,  punishable  under  Section  364(2)  has"
"been brought on the basis that he has aided and abetted the 1st accused"
"in committing the rape because according to Explanation-1 to Section"
"364 of the Penal Code “Where the offence of rape is committed by one or"
"more person in a group of persons, each person in such group committing"
"or abetting the commission of such offence is deemed to have committed"
"gang rape.”"
"However, in the case at hand, it has already been decided that the 1st"
"appellant cannot be convicted for the offence of rape or gang rape as he"
"has not been identified. Therefore, the 3rd charge brought against the"
"2nd appellant for aiding and abetting the 1st appellant to commit rape"
"also necessarily fails."
"Now, only the 1st charge against the 2nd appellant has to be considered."
"PW-1 stated that the 2nd appellant uttered the words “අක්වක් කෑ ගහන්න"
"එපා, කියන්න එපා” (Page  61  of  the  appeal  brief)  when  they  came  behind"
"her. It is not clear why he stated “Don’t shout, don’t tell” while he was"
"going  behind  her.  Anyhow,  PW-1  stated  that  she  identified  the  2nd"
"appellant by hearing those words."
