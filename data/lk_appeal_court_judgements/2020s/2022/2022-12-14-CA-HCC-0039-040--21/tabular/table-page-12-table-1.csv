"on the other hand, demonstrate that she was not sure as to who raped"
"her, although she stated that both appellants raped her."
"A
lready, this court has decided that the 1st and 2nd counts against the"
"1st appellant and the 3rd count against the 2nd appellant have not been"
"proved.  Only  the  1st  count  against  the  2nd  appellant  remains  to  be"
"considered.  As  the  aforesaid  items  of  evidence  of  PW-1  create  doubt"
"about  her  credibility,  her  evidence  cannot  be  considered  as  cogent"
"evidence.  Hence,  I  am  of  the  view  that  it  is  unsafe  to  convict  the  2nd"
"appellant for the 1st count on the voice identification evidence of PW-1."
"Therefore, I hold that the 1st charge against the 2nd appellant has also"
"not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt."
"F
or the foregoing reasons, I hold that the learned High Court Judgeâ€™s"
"decision to convict the appellants for the charges against them is bad"
"in  law.  Therefore,  I  quash  the  convictions  of  both  appellants.  The"
"judgment dated 28.04.2021 and the sentences of imprisonment, fines"
"imposed,  on  the  1st  and  2nd  appellants,  and  the  order  made  on"
"compensation are set aside. The 1st accused-appellant is acquitted of"
"charges one and two. The 2nd accused-appellant is acquitted of charges"
"one and three."
"T
he appeals of the 1st and 2nd appellants are allowed."
