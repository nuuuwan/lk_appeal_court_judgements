"different legal personalities. Therefore, the learned District Judge’s conclusion is not agreeable"
"with  the  law.  The  Managing  Director’s  evidence  that  he  had  to  face  disrepute,  and  even  his"
"family members had a low opinion of him cannot be considered as disrepute to Plaintiff."
"P
laintiff is a legal entity, but one must understand it cannot give evidence. The evidence of the"
"Managing  Director  of  the  company  is  given  not  only  on  his  behalf  but  also  on  behalf  of  the"
"company. He became the voice of the company. The learned District Judge had analysed the"
"evidence as an individual and as a representative of the Plaintiff company."
"I
n the Judgment, the learned District Judge had observed and placed on record that the Plaintiff"
"is a limited liability company. Therefore, the evidence of the witness is treated as evidence of"
"the Plaintiff on that ground the argument of the Appellant fails."
"A
nother argument of the Appellant is “has the learned District Judge misdirected himself on the"
"evidence of proof of damages allegedly suffered by the Respondent?”"
"T
he Appellant contends that loss of income is special damage that has to be specifically pleaded"
"and proved. The documents marked as  [P17], [P18], and [P19], which were auditors’ reports"
"marked subject  to  proof,  were not  proved. Therefore, those documents cannot  be considered."
"Perusing the Judgment, there is no reference to the documents marked as [P17], [P18], and [P19]"
"in the Judgment. Therefore, I am compelled to accept that those documents had no bearing on"
"the Judgment. The learned District Judge had mentioned that evidence was not led regarding"
"those documents."
"I
ssue No.11 is an issue on which damages were mentioned, and in the Plaint, the Plaintiff had"
"claimed damages. If the Appellant intended to raise an issue on loss of income, they should have"
"done so. What was not argued cannot be taken for someone’s advantage. In this context, loss of"
"income had been discussed in the form of closing of the theatre for many days. There is ample"
"evidence of the income of the theatre while running. Therefore, what the learned District Judge"
"had discussed regarding loss of income rejects the argument of the Appellant."
