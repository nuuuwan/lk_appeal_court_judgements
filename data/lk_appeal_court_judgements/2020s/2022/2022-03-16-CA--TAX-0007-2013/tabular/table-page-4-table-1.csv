"The   Inland   Revenue   (amendment)   Act   No.   19   of   2009   was   endorsed   by   the"
"Speaker   on   31st  March   2009.   The   18-month   period   for   the   first   year   of"
"assessment relevant to this case ended before that on 30.09.2008."
"The   year   of   assessment   2007/2008   begins   on   01.04.2007   and   ends   on"
"31.03.2008.   The   period   of   18   months   given   in   section   163(5)   prior   to   its"
"amendment is calculated from 31.03.2008 and therefore ends on 30.09.2009."
"The position of the appellant is that the Notice of Assessment for 2007/2008"
"which was received by him on 14.10.2009 is out of time."
"As   Inland   Revenue   (amendment)   Act   No.19   of   2009   was   endorsed   by   the"
"Speaker on 31.03.2009, it has come into operation within the second year of"
"assessment relevant to this case."
"In CA (TAX) 23/20131 decided by another division of this court on 25.05.2015."
"the respondent, the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (who is also the"
"respondent in this appeal) had taken a two fold argument. It is said at page 3"
"of the said case. “one argument is that the amendment came into force within"
"the   eighteen   month   period   where   the   assessor   was   entitled   to   send   the"
"assessment against the assessee and therefore the extension of time period is"
"applicable. The other argument is that it is a procedural law and any change in"
"the   procedural   law   can   be   considered   as   an   amendment   with   retrospective"
"effect.”"
"The   first   argument   aforesaid,   if   correct,   will   apply   to   the   second   year   of"
"assessment   in this appeal because   the  first  18  month period   ended  anyway"
"before the commencement of the amendment by Act No.19 of 2009. In the said"
"case CA (TAX) 23/2013 it was decided at page 5."
