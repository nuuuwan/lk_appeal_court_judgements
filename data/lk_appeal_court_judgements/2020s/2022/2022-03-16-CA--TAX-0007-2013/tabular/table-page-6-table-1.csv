"Hence it is submitted at paragraph 66 of the said final written submission that"
"the applicability of the Act is year on year. (emphasis is in the final written"
"submission of the appellant)"
"Hence it is further submitted that since the amendment Act 19 of 2009 was"
"certified on 31.03.2009, the amendment to section 163(5) (a) was brought into"
"force prospectively with effect from 01st April 2009 which is the date on which"
"the year of assessment 2009/2010 begins."
"This  is an acceptable argument  because the title to the Inland Revenue  Act"
"No.10 of 2006 says “FOR THE IMPOSITION OF INCOME TAX FOR ANY YEAR"
"OF ASSESSMENT COMMENCING ON OR AFTER APRIL 1,2006.”"
"Hence it appears that the operations of Act “is year on year”. The intention of"
"the legislature appears to be to enact the law on the basis of separate years of"
"assessment."
"Hence   this   court   cannot   accept   the  argument   on  procedural   law   which   was"
"accepted in CA TAX 23/2013. In fact, in that case itself at page 6 it is stated,"
"Maxwell on “The Interpretation of Statutes”, 12th edition page 222 says;"
