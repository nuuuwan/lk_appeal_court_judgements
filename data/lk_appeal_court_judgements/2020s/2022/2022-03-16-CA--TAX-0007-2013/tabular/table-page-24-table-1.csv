"Supreme   Court   said   reasons   can   be   given   at   the   time   of   the   notice   of"
"assessment, both courts agreed that giving reasons cannot be after the sending"
"of the notice of assessment, which both courts considered as synonymous"
"with making the assessment."
"Hence  although it is correct  to say that both the aforesaid cases  [Ismail vs."
"Commissioner of Income Tax, as well as D.M.S. Fernando vs. Ismail] were not"
"on   the   point   whether   “making   the   assessment”   as   well   as   “giving   notice   of"
"assessment”, must be within the stipulated time period, they both took it for"
"granted,  in their  analysis of the procedure,  that  “making the  assessment” is"
"same as “giving notice of assessment”. Whereas Justice Victor Perera said that"
"giving reasons for non acceptance of the return should precede the notice of"
"assessment, the learned Chief Justice said that reasons should be sent at or"
"about   the   time  of   giving   notice   of  assessment   and  any   later   communication"
"would defeat the remedial action intended by the amendment."
"Therefore both Justice Victor Perera and the learned Chief Justice have"
"based their judgments on the premise that “making the assessment” is"
"same as “giving notice of assessment”. This was why it had been argued in"
"C.A. (Tax) 17/2017 that no lawfully valid assessment can be made without first"
"serving a valid notice of assessment. The Division of this court in C.A. (Tax)"
"17/2017 thought that this is a practical impossibility. A letter cannot be sent"
"without it being written. But what was meant is not this. The argument of the"
"appellant   is   that   an   “assessment”   becomes   valid   only   when   the   “notice”   is"
"Ismail vs. Commissioner of Income Tax
given. This position was the basis of"
"as   well   as  
 D.M.S.   Fernando   vs.   Ismail
 ,   despite   those   two   cases   were"
"concerned with the duty to give “reasons”. The position of the appellant is that"
"an “assessment” is no assessment until “notice of assessment” is given. The"
"position could have been otherwise, viz., an “assessment” could have been a"
"valid   assessment,   as   soon   as   an   estimate   is   made,   if   like   in  Honig"
