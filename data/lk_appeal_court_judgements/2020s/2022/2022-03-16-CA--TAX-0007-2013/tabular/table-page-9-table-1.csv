"assessment. It is stated in the final written submission of the respondent that"
"the Act provides separate provisions for making of assessments and sending of"
"Notice of Assessments and whereas the legislature has intentionally provided a"
"time frame for making the assessment it has intentionally not provided a time"
"frame for sending the Notice of assessment."
"If this argument is accepted, it means that the assessor only has to make the"
"assessment within the stipulated time but he can indefinitely delay the sending"
"of the Notice of Assessment."
"But as it was seen section 163(1) refers to “assess the amount …… and shall"
"by notice in writing  require such person to pay forthwith  ……….”. section"
"163(1) also says subject to the provisions of subsection (3) and (5)."
"This shows that the duty to “assess” is not only coupled with the duty to serve"
"“notice in writing” but both are subject to the provisions of subsection (3) and"
"(5) of section 163 of the Act."
"If not the assessor will be able to make an assessment even after the stipulated"
"period and send Notice of Assessment to the assessee. If the assessee takes the"
"position   that   the   assessment   was   not   made   within   the   prescribed   time   the"
"assessor will be free to produce a document made after the prescribed time but"
"incorrectly bears a date within the prescribed time as evidence of making the"
"assessment."
