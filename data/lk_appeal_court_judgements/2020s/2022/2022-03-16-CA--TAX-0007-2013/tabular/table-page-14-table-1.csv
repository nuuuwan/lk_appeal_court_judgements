"vs.   Sarsfield   (H.   M.   Inspector   of   Taxes)   Reported   (Ch.D)   [1985]   STC   31;"
"(CA) [1986] STC 246 it is said,"
"“….A back duty enquiry was instituted in 1970 and, on 16 th  March"
"1970,   an   Inspector   of   Taxes   signed   a   certificate   in   volume   1   of   his"
"District Assessment books stating that he had made assessments on the"
"administrators for the years 1960-61 to 1966-67 inclusive. The notices of"
"assessment   were   issued   on   16th  March   1970,   but   did   not   reach   the"
"administrators until after 07th  April 1970. It was common ground that"
"the assessments would be out of time unless made before 06th April 1970"
"by reason of the provisions of section 34 and section 40(1) of the Taxes"
"Management Act of 1970. The administrators appealed."
"The Special Commissioners held that (1) the assessments were “made”"
"on   16th  March   1970,   when   a   duly   authorized   Inspector   signed   the"
"certificate   in   volume   1.   They   were   therefore   not   out   of   time;   (2)   the"
"increases   to   the   assessments   contended   for   by   the   Inspector   were"
"supportable. They did not accept the oral evidence of the son, M. Honig,"
"one of the administrators, that the increases in capital disclosed by the"
"statements were attributable to rental income arising to the son, not the"
"deceased."
"The   Chancery   Division,   dismissing   the   appeal,   held   that   on   the   first"
"point, it was clear on a proper construction of sections 29 and 114 of the"
"Taxes Management Act of 1970, that the making of the assessment was"
"not dependent  on the service  of the notice of assessment. The Special"
"Commissioners   were   plainly   right   to   hold   that   the   assessments   were"
"made   on   16th  March   1970   and   so   within   the   time   limit   prescribed   by"
"sections 34 and 40 (1) of that Act. On the second point, there was no"
"possible   ground   on   which   the   court   could   hold   that   the   Special"
