"(a) who or which has made a return of his or its income on or before the thirtieth"
"day of September of the year of assessment immediately succeeding that year of"
"assessment, shall be made after the expiry of eighteen months from the end"
"of that year of assessment;"
"Therefore   the   notice   of   assessment   must   be   given   subject   to   section   163(5)"
"which deals with the time limit. As already said the Tax Appeal Commission"
"has accepted that the notice of assessment given in the present case was given"
"after   the   stipulated   time.   It   says   “a   few   days   delay”   will   not   make   the"
"assessment invalid. But its decision is in violation of the provisions in section"
