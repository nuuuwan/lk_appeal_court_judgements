"16. Soertsz   J.,   while   disagreeing   with   the   learned   Chief   Justice   that   the"
"Crown had the option to assess either under section 6(1)(a) or 6(1)(e), also"
"disagreed with Keuneman J., that if the business consist of the receipt of"
"dividends, etc., or if that can be clearly separated from the rest of the"
"business, then any special provision applicable to dividends, etc., must"
"apply."
"17. Keuneman J., said, “The difficulty arises with regard to sources (e), (f)"
"and  (g).  In these  cases  there  are  no  words   employed   to  show   that   the"
"earlier sources are excluded. For example take source (e), viz., “dividends,"
"interest or discounts”. There are no words to show that this source does"
"not   apply   to   dividends,   interest   or   discounts   arising   from   a   trade   or"
"business”."
"18. Keuneman   J.,   at   the   end   decided,   “How   then   are   we   to   treat   income"
"which comes under source (e) but can also be regarded as coming under"
"source (a)? In my opinion it was the intention of the Ordinance to regard"
"dividends, interest or discounts as a separate source. If then the business"
"of   an   individual   or   a   company   consists   in   the   receipt   of   dividends,"
"interest   or   discounts   alone,   or   if   the   business   of   receiving   dividends,"
"interest or discounts can be clearly separated from the rest of the trade or"
"business, then any special provision applicable to dividends, interest or"
"discounts must be applied. I do not think any question of option arises”."
"19. Hence with regard to the applicability of especial provisions applicable to"
"dividends,   etc.,   (such   as   section   63)   Keuneman   J.,   agreed   with   the"
"learned   Chief   Justice   (since  the   latter  as   said   in  15   decided  the   same"
"thing).   Although   Soertsz   J.,   differed   on   this   point,   De   Kretser   J.   and"
"Wijeyewardene J., agreed with Keuneman J. Hence 04 Judges out of 05"
"agreed on that point which becomes its decision."
"20. Thus the case of Ceylon Financial Investments Limited vs. Commissioner"
"of Income Tax, although cited for the respondent in the present case to"
"show that the appellant receiving dividends, etc., only was decided to be"
"39 | C A   ( T A X )   2 6   2 0 1 3   J u d g m e n t   –   J u s ti c e   D u s h m a n t a   N ."
