"“The remarks of Atkin L. J. also are in point, “I myself have no difficulty at all in"
"coming to the conclusion that this company is in fact carrying on business and it"
"carried on a business of receiving the profits from the concession, in which it still"
"retains   an   interest.   It   is   true   that   it   may   be   called,   if   you   please,   a   passive"
"carrying   on   of
  business   as   opposed  
to   an   active   carrying   on   of"
"business….Personally, if any emphasis is attached to the word “active”, I think it"
"would narrow the meaning of the word; for I see nothing to prevent a holding"
"company, which is a very well known method of carrying on business in these"
"days, from carrying on business”."
"Referring to another case cited, His lordship said,"
"“Further in The Commissioners of Inland Revenue vs. The South Behar Railway"
"Co., 12 Reports of Tax Cases 657, decided in the House of Lords, Viscount Cave"
"L. C. said: “It is true the company carries on no trade or manufacture and that its"
"principal and only function at the present moment is to receive and distribute the"
"fruits of its undertaking; but that is a part and a material part of the purpose for"
"which it came into existence. It was not intended to be a trading but a financial"
"company;….The company can no longer be called upon to fulfil its first purpose,"
"namely,   to   make   advances   for   a   construction   of   the   line,   because   all   the"
"necessary funds have already been advanced; but it is still fulfilling its second"
"purpose, which was to receive an income for its shareholders….and to distribute"
"it among them, ….I think, therefore, that the company still carries on a business"
"or similar undertaking within the meaning of section 52 of the Finance Act 1920”."
"Refuting the argument of the Commissioner of Income Tax, that, in those cited"
"cases, the word, “business” was given an especial meaning, His lordship said,"
"“It has however been contended for the Commissioner that the interpretation of"
"the word “business” in these cases has particular relation to the meaning of that"
"word in its special context. I do not think this is correct”."
