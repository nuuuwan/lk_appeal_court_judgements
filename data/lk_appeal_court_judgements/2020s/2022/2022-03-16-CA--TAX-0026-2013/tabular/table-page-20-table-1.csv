"the profits from any trade, business, profession or vocation. Source (b) deals with","",""
"a very distinct matter, viz., the profits from any employment. Source (c) deals","",""

"as it is not occupied for the purpose of a trade, business, profession or vocation.","",""
"There is a clear differentiation between source (c) and source (a) and I think the","",""
"language shows that it is distinct from source (b) also. Source (d) deals with the","",""
"net annual value of land used rent free by an occupier, etc., in so far as it is not","",""
"included  in  sources   (a),  (b)  and  (c).  So   far  I  think  those  sources   are   mutually","",""
