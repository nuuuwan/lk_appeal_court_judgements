"However, 
location 
'B'  contravened 
the  Urban  Development  Authorities  Regulation"
"37(1)c, 
for  being  a  proposed  construction  which  was  within 
the  boundary 
line."
"Therefore,  the  Dehiwala-Mount  Lavinia  Municipal  Council  and  UDA  did  not  grant"
"approval  for  the  installation  of  the  electricity  transformer  at  the  proposed  location  'B'."
"Moreover, the Divisional Secretary by the letter dated 19.05.2017 requested the CEB to"
"consider an alternative location for the installation of the electricity transformer. Further,"
"on 05.07.2021, the Divisional Secretary informed the CEB by the letter marked ‘P9’ to"
"consider  and  take  necessary  steps  to 
install  the  electricity  transformer  at  a  suitable"
"location,  which 
the  Divisional  Secretariat  did  not  have 
the  necessary 
technical"
"knowledge to determine."
"On the first date of support of the instant application, it was submitted on behalf of the"
"Respondents that the transformer room has been proposed to be constructed at the new"
"location  'C'  (as  depicted  in  the  sketch  marked  ‘1R1’),  which  is  2  feet  away  from  the"
"Petitioner's  boundary  wall,  maintaining  a  distance  of  9.5  feet  between  the  electricity"
"transformer  and  the  Petitioner's  boundary  wall.  Though  the  proposed  location  'C'  was"
"recommended  by  the  CEB  and  approved  by  the  UDA,  the  Petitioner  asserts  that  the"
"location  'C'  proposes  building  the  transformer  room  on  the  originally  objected  location"
"'A' with a slight change in dimensions."
"The  Petitioner  objected 
to 
the  CEB  on  12.08.2021  against 
the  construction  of 
the"
"transformer  room  and  the  installation  of  the  electricity  transformer,  requesting  it  to  be"
"installed beyond 10 meters from his residence. The said objection was also forwarded to"
"the Chairman of the UDA, the Chairman of the Condominium Management Authority"
"and the Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission. As a result, the CEB informed the"
"Divisional Secretary of the Petitioner's objection, requesting the Divisional Secretary to"
"conduct a field inspection and submit her recommendations on 19.08.2021. Further, on"
"30.08.2021, 
the  CEB 
informed  Vesta  Homes 
that 
the 
installation  of 
the  electricity"
"transformer  has  been 
suspended  until 
the 
receipt  of 
the  Divisional  Secretariat's"
"recommendations.  However, 
the  Divisional  Secretary  by  her 
letter  marked 
‘P13’,"
"referred to her letter dated 05.07.2021 marked ‘P9’ and informed the CEB that it is the"
"CEB  that  possesses  the  necessary  technical  knowledge  to  make  such  recommendation"
"thus, the CEB may take the appropriate steps in that regard. Accordingly, the CEB now"
"recommends the installation of the electricity transformer at location 'C'."
