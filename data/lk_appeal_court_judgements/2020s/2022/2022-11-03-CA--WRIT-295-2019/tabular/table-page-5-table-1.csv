"Nomination Paper other than the women candidates who have been elected"
"or are not disqualified to be a member under section 9.‚Äù"
"In  terms  of  section  66A  (1)  of  the  said  Ordinance,  it  is  abundantly  clear  that,"
"when  one  of  the  seats  of  a  local  authority  falls  vacant,  the  Returning  Officer"
"appointed  for  the  electoral  area  in  which  the  local  authority  is  situated  shall"
"inform the Secretary of the political party or the independent group to which that"
"member belongs, to nominate a candidate from the first nomination paper or the"
"additional nomination paper."
"In  the 
instant  application,  the  1st  Respondent  being  the  Returning  officer"
"informed 
the  SLPP 
to  nominate  a  candidate 
for 
the  vacancy  created  by"
"Amarasingha  Arachchige 
Ishara  Madushani  Amarasingha.  Accordingly,  the"
"Secretary of SLPP nominated Ethugalpedige Wimalawathi (8th Respondent) who"
"was in the additional list of SLPP. Thereafter, the 8th Respondent was declared a"
"member of the said Pradeshiya Sabha by P10."
"Thus, it is apparent that the appointment of the 8th Respondent as Councilor of"
"Aranayake Pradeshiya Sabha is strictly within the ambit of the provisions of the"
"Local  Authorities  Elections  Ordinance  (as  amended).  It  appears  to  this  Court"
"that, in terms of the provisions of the said Ordinance, the 1st Respondent is not"
"bound  to  appoint  a  candidate  from  the  same  ward  in  which  the  vacancy  has"
"occurred."
"Moreover, it is to be noted that, as provided by the proviso to section 66A (1) of"
"the said Ordinance, when a vacancy occurs in a case of a woman member of a"
"Local  Authority,  such  vacancy  shall  be  filled  only  by  the  nomination  of  a"
"woman candidate from the first nomination paper or the additional list. In short,"
"as per the proviso, where a vacancy occurs in the case of a woman member, only"
"a  woman  candidate  could 
fill  that  vacancy  provided  that  such  a  woman"
"candidate is not disqualified under section 9."
"The 8th Respondent is a woman candidate from the SLPP whose name appears"
"in the additional list. Hence, in terms of section 66A (1) of the said Ordinance,"
"the  8th  Respondent 
is  entitled 
to  be  appointed 
in  place  of  Amarasingha"
"Arachchige Ishara Madushani Amarasingha who was also a woman candidate."
"Admittedly, the SLPP won the majority of the wards of the Aranayake Pradeshiya"
"Sabha, and accordingly, the SLPP was allocated 13 seats and one overhang seat,"
"altogether 14 seats [Vide- section 65AA (1)]. In the event a seat of SLPP becomes"
"vacant, a candidate from the same political party is to be appointed to fill such"
"vacancy. The contention of the Petitioner who contested under the UNP, that he"
"is eligible to be appointed to the vacancy on the basis that  he secured the 2nd"
"highest number of votes from the Debathgama Division is devoid of merits and"
"misconceived  in  law.  This  Court  is  mindful  of  the  fact  that  the  law  does  not"
