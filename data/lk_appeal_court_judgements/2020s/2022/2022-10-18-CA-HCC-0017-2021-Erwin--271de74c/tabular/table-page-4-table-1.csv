failed 
to 
state 
the"
"","precise place in which the heroin parcel was hidden in"
"","the underwear."
"4.","The 
learned 
Deputy 
Solicitor 
General 
for 
the"
"","respondent  submitted  that, 
it  was  evident  that  the"
"","raiding party parked their vehicle elsewhere and slowly"
"","walked close to the bridge at Leslie Ranagala Mawatha"
"","to avoid any  person from  identifying  their  vehicle.  The"
"","learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General 
further  submitted"
"","that, the appellant in his statement from the dock has"
"","clearly  admitted  that  he  was  arrested  by  the  raiding"
"","party."
"5.","According  to  the  dock  statement  of  the  appellant,  he"
"","has admitted that, on the 19th of June 2015, the officer"
"","Fonseka  (PW2)  arrested  him.  It  was  his  position  that"
"","he  was  not 
in  possession  of  any 
illegal  substance."
"","However,  after  he  was  arrested,  according 
to 
the"
"","appellant,  officer  Fonseka  heavily  assaulted  him  and"
"","thereafter  he  was  produced  before  a  medical  officer"
"","and  obtained  a  medical  report.  Both  the  witnesses"
"","PW1  and  PW2  have  been  consistent  in  their  evidence"
"","with regard to the raid and the arrest of the appellant."
"","They  have  clearly  stated  that  the  heroin  was  found"
"","inside 
the 
appellant’s 
underwear. 
Therefore, 
not"
"","mentioning 
in 
their  notes  about 
the  precise  place"
"","inside  the  underwear  in  which  the  heroin  was  placed"
"","should  not  be  a  reason  to  discredit  the  witnesses."
"","Further,  not  providing  the  underwear  in  court  as  a"
"","production 
is  also  not  a 
reason 
to  discredit 
the"
"","witnesses.  Neither 
in  cross  examination  nor 
in  his"
"","statement  from  the  dock  has  the  appellant  taken  up"
"","the  position  that  he  was  not  wearing  an  underwear."
"","Therefore,  not  providing  the  underwear  in  court  shall"
"","not affect the credibility of prosecution witnesses."
"6.","The position taken up by the appellant was that, after"
"","the  arrest  he  was  heavily  assaulted.  It  is  evident  that"
