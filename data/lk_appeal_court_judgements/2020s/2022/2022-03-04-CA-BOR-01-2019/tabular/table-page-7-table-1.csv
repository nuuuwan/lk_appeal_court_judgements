"aggrieved land was to be valued, and the ‘Board’ decided the Market Value as at 08.05.2014 [A3"
"and R6]."
"I
t was the contention of the Respondent-Appellant that the Board erred in Law by failing to make"
"proper analysis of the land, evaluation of the sales, past awards and past valuations submitted by"
"both  parties  in  comparing  the  nature,  access,  extent,  use,  lie  and  the  location  of  the  acquired"
"property."
"Perusing the Order of the ‘Board of Review’,it appears that the Chairman had analyzed the values"
"of  sales  and  past  awards  made  by  the  Chief  Valuer  (The  expert  valuer  of  the  Appellant)  and"
"compared those with the acquired land in arriving at its conclusion."
"The  Respondent’s  expert  valuer  submitted  to  the  ‘Board’  that  he  arrived  at  his  amount  of"
"compensation of Rs. 20,170,000/- at Rs. 63,000/- per perch."
"The said valuer based his value for the acquired land by analyzing two transfer deeds and two past"
"awards  made  by  the  expert  valuer  [Chief  Valuer]  of  the  Appellant.  (Marked  as  ‘A6’  in  the"
"location sketch which is referred to in to 1st paragraph of Page 2, to 1st paragraph in Page 3 and"
"also to 1st paragraph and 3rd paragraph of Page 4 of the ‘Order)."
"The  Appellant’s  expert  valuer  too  submitted  to  the  ‘Board’  that  he  arrived  at  his  amount  of"
"compensation of Rs. 4,510,000/- (at Rs. 14,093/75 per perch) based on analyzing three transfer"
"deeds marked as ‘R2’ in the location sketch which is referred to in 3rd and 4th paragraphs of Page"
"10 and 2nd paragraph of Page 11 of the ‘Order’."
"I
t is worthy to note that, before the ‘Board’, the District Valuer who represent the Chief Valuer"
"has  to  give  oral  evidence  and  has  to  tender  relevant  documents  to  satisfy  the  ‘Board’  of  the"
"reasonableness of the value arrived at in conformity with Sections 45, 46, 46 and 48 of the Land"
"Acquisition Act including the regulations (Marked as ‘A3’ by the Appellant) and is subjected to"
"cross examination of the counsel of the opposing party."
"A
s such, the District Valuer who represents the Chief Valuer, even though they are experts in the"
"field of valuation, before the ‘Board’, they are only expert witnesses who cannot bind the ‘Board’,"
"had referred to the last paragraph of page 11 to 1st paragraph of page 13 of the ‘Order’ and  analyzed"
"the  past  awards  made  by  the  Chief  Valuer  (Expert  Valuer  of  the  Appellant)  in  arriving  at  the"
"compensation to be paid for the acquired land."
