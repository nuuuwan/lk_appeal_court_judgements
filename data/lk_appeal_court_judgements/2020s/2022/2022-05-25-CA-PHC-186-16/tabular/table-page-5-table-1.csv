"At the outset it is pertinent to highlight the nature of the revisionary jurisdiction"
"exercised by the High Court which is concurrent to that of the Court of Appeal."
"(Ramalingam  v  Parameswary  and  Others  (2000)  2  SLR  33).  As  such,  the"
"revisionary jurisdiction vested on the High Court is wide enough to allow relief"
"that the Court deems fit. However, such an inherent power must be utilised only"
"in the appropriate case. If the fact of the case shocks the conscience of the Court,"
"an appropriate order must be  delivered in furtherance of the administration of"
"justice."
"During the argument stage, the counsel for the appellant submitted that the High"
"Court had  made  a  premature  order.  It  was  contended  that  the  submissions  of"
"parties  before  the  High  Court  were  on  a  preliminary  matter  pertaining  to  the"
"maintainability of the revision application of the respondent. Hence, the parties"
"limited  their  submissions  to  the 
jurisdictional  matter.  The  counsel 
for  the"
"appellant argued that instead of delivering an order on the maintainability of the"
"revision application, the learned High Court judge had ordered a retrial by way"
"of  a  final  order.  In  the  written  submissions,  the  appellant  contended  that  the"
"High Court did not explicitly set aside the Magistrate Court judgment or the  order"
"dated  31.3.2015  but  ordered  a  retrial,  which  was  not  prayed 
for  by 
the"
"respondent.  The  appellant  cited  King  v  Fernando  48  NLR  249,  Queen  v"
"Jayasinghe  69  NLR  314  to  support  the  contention  that  order  of  retrial  is"
"warranted  under  exceptional circumstances  considering the time taken for the"
"case since the alleged offence."
"The respondent’s  counsel  primarily  focused  on  how  the  trial  progressed in  the"
"Magistrate  Court.  As  such,  the  counsel  for the  respondent  contended  that  the"
"Magistrate  had  prejudiced  the  respondent  by  considering  extraneous  material"
"that violates evidentiary principles. As such, the respondent contended that the"
"Magistrate had entertained statements by third parties who were not named as"
"witnesses  to  the  trial,  which  were  later  used  to  incriminate  the  respondent"
"unjustly. It was also submitted that the Magistrate has acted outside the ambit"
"of  his  jurisdiction  and  determined  the  respondent  to  be  of  unsound  mind  and"
"then imposed a fine for the respondent’s deeds."
