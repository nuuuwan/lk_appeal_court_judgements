"It was contended on behalf of the Added Defendant that the land in dispute"
"was acquired by the State as per the Gazette Notification marked 2V50. It"
"is manifestly clear that the corpus in this case is not mentioned in 2V50."
"The learned District Judge has correctly observed the fact that the subject"
"matter (lot-242) has not originally been depicted in the plan 2V50, and"
"subsequently the same has surreptitiously been interpolated into the said"
"plan which is shown in red in colour (vide Appeal brief Vol-II page 139)."
"The  witness  U.A.  Somapala  has  asserted  that  he  was  unaware  of  that"
"interpolation."
"It is also evident that the original owner of this land was the State and Don"
"Andiris De Silva Jayasekera had purchased the same from the state. This"
"fact is well established by the document marked P13 which was issued by"
"the Government Agent of Galle on 02.07.1920. It is pertinent to be noted"
"that the said document P13 (receipt No. P06333) has been mentioned in"
"the schedule of the title deed marked P3 as well. The witnesses of the Added"
"Defendant while giving evidence in Court have not disputed the document"
"marked P13. The learned trial Judge was mindful of the fact that further"
"proof of P13 is not necessary as the same was thirty years old (vide section"
"90 of the Evidence Ordinance, No. 14 of 1895)."
"Hence,  it  is  well  established  by  oral  and  documentary  evidence  that  the"
"Plaintiff and his predecessors in title have been in exclusive possession of"
"the subject matter from 1920.  Furthermore, it appears to this Court that"
"the subject matter is not shown in the title plans produced by the Added"
"Defendant."
"In  these  circumstances,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  finding  of  the  learned"
"District Judge is according to law and not erroneous."
"Therefore, I dismiss the appeal with costs, fixed at Rs. 30,000/- and affirm"
"the impugned judgment of the learned District Judge of Balapitiya."
