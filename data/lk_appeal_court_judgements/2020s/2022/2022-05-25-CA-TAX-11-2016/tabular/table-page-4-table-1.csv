"The","jurisdiction  of  the  Respondent  when  an  appeal","is  made  to  him","is  clearly"
"","demarcated by Section 165(13) of the Inland Revenue Act.  This Section reads as,","",""
"","In determining an appeal under this section, the Commissioner General may confirm,","",""
"reduce, increase or annul the assessment appealed against and shall give notice in writing to","","",""
"the appellant, of his determination on the appeal. [emphasis added]","","",""
"","In  the  instant  case,  the  Respondent  has  widened  the  scope  of  his  assessment  by","",""
"","varying  the  contours  of  the  Assessorâ€™s  assessment  by  assessing  previously  unassessed","",""
"","receipts. It is not a mere increase in the quantum assessed, such an increase being within his","",""
"jurisdiction.","","",""
"","Further, by this variation of the contours of the assessment and making what amounts","",""
"","to a fresh assessment, the Respondent is not in compliance with the time limit set out by the","",""
"","legislature in Section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act. Section 163(5) requires the filing of","",""
"","return to be done on or before the thirtieth day of November immediately succeeding the end","",""

"","assessment of profits on disposal of shares is thereby out of time.","",""
"","Thus, this Court is of the view that the Respondent is not entitled to widen the scope","",""
"","of his assessment, beyond the initial assessment undertaken by the Assessor. In the instant","",""
"","case, it was not a mere increase as envisaged in Section 165(13) of the Act, the increase was","",""
"","owing to the said fresh assessment. Further, the fresh assessment was not possible because","",""
"","of the statutory time bar found in Section 163(5). This is not to say that it is possible for the","",""
"","Respondent to widen his scope of assessment if it fell within the time period.","",""
"","On the other hand, if we presume the Assessee had not appealed the decision of the","",""
"","Assessor  then  the  question  arises  whether  the  Commissioner  General  can  make  a  fresh","",""
