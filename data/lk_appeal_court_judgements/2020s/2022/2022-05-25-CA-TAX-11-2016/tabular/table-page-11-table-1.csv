"In view of the opinion of this Court set out above, we hold that questions 5 and 6 must"
"be  answered  in  favour  of  the  Appellant.  The  Respondentâ€™s  assessment  is  excessive  and"
"without lawful justification, and therefore the TAC erred in law when it reached the same"
"conclusion."
"Therefore, having answered questions 1, 5, and 6 in favour of the Appellant, we remit"
"the case record to the TAC under Section 11(A)(6) of the TAC Act to revise the assessment"
"according to the opinion of this Court."
