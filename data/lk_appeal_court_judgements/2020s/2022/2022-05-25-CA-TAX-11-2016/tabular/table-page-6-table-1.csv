"v.  Ismail  [1982]  1  SLR  222).  The  rationale  was  elucidated  in the  clearest  of  terms  by  His"
"Lordship Samarakoon C.J. in the same case."
"“Under the law that existed at the time, the Assessor was not bound to disclose any"
"reasons  either  on  the  file  or  by  communication  to  the  Assessee.    The  Assessee  could  only"
"appeal  against  the  quantum  of  assessment  and  the  onus  of  proof  lay  on  the  Assessee.  He"
"could only speculate on the reasons for such assessment for the purposes of his appeal. The"
"picture is now different…."
"The primary purpose of the amending legislation is to ensure that the Assessor will"
"bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite determination whether or not to"
"accept it. It was intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly unfair assessments which many"
"Assessors  had  been  making  as  “  a  protective  measure"".  An  unfortunate  practice  had"
"developed where some Assessors, due to pressure of work and other reasons, tended to delay"
"looking at a return till the last moment and then without a proper scrutiny of the return,"
"made a grossly exaggerated assessment……. Under the amendment when an Assessor does"
"not accept a return, it must mean that at the relevant point of time he has brought his mind"
"to bear on the return and has come to a decision on rejecting the return. Consequent to this"
"rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the Assessee.” [emphasis added]"
"In  the  instant  case,  communication  of  the  reasons  of  the  Assessor  has  taken  place"
"albeit the notice of assessment is not issued by the same Assessor who made the assessment"
"and communicated his reasons for the same. However, when the purpose of this practice is"
"observed, it is clear that in the instant case, the Assessor, one M.M.O. Wijesuriya, has done"
"what  was  required  of  him  by  giving  his  mind  to  the  return  and  making  a  definite"
"determination not to accept it. He has communicated his reasons for arriving at his decision"
"to the Appellant. No prejudice could be said to have been caused to the Appellant."
"Therefore,  we  hold  that  merely  because  the  Assessor  who  issued  the  notice  of"
"assessment  is  not  the  same  Assessor  who  made  the  assessment  and  communicated  the"
"reasons for making the assessment, the Assessment is not bad in law."
