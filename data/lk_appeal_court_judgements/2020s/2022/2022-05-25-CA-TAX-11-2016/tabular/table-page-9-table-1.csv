"His Lordship Keuneman J. arrived at the same conclusion when His Lordship held,"
"“But it is manifest that its objects have not been accomplished and although at present"
"it carries on a “passive” or “dormant” life, it has not ceased to carry on business. The operation"
"of receiving and discharging the debts due to it is regularly repeated. In fact, it carries on"
"business in the way that a holding company carries on business”."
"It is therefore clear that the business carried on by the Appellant company, can in fact"

"applicable to dividends, interest or discount must be applied.”"
"The  above  interpretation  has  now  been  given  a  statutory  footing,  by  virtue  of  the"
"amendments introduced in 2014 and 2015, to Section 63, which at the argument stage, this"
"Court  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  learned  Counsel.  This  Section  reproduced  for  the"
"purpose of convenience, reads as follows,"
