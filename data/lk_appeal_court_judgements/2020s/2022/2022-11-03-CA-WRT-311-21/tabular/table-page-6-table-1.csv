"Awarded  28  days  detention  with  forfeiture  of  pay  and  allowances  for  the  period  of"
"detention. (Vide R6)"
"As per the above reasons for the said judgement, the inquiring officer has come to"
"the conclusion based on the documentary evidence produced before the court that"
"the  accused  (Petitioner)  did  consume  cannabis.  Therefore,  it  is  obvious  that  the"
"inquiring officer has arrived at his decision on the said urine report."
"In  such  circumstances,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  failure  to  follow  the  correct"
"procedure laid down in the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Urine Analysis"
"marked R3 has deprived the Petitioner of his right to a fair hearing."
"T
he Petitioner further complains that the expulsion of the service of the Petitioner"
"after the punishment (P3) is also illegal. The Respondents state that the Sri Lanka Air"
"Force  maintains  a  zero-tolerance  policy  in  cases  of  consumption/possession  of"
"dangerous drugs defined in the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance."
"The said policy has been specified in the relevant Station Routine Orders (R8), the"
"circular dated 15.09.2017 (R9) and the 5th schedule (xiii) in the Ceylon Government"
"Gazette No.10665 dated 23 April 1954 (R10) submitted by the Respondents. The"
"personnel  convicted  for  the  above  offences  will  be  discharged  from  the  service"
"under  the  clause  of  “Service  No  Longer  Required”  provided  for  in  the  Air  Force"
"(Regular  and  Regular  Reserve)  Regulations  of  1951.  It  is  apparent  that  the  said"
"expulsion order pertaining to the Petitioner is wholly based on the conviction of the"
"charge  of  consumption  of  cannabis.  However,  since  the  said  conviction  for  the"
"charge  of  consumption  of  cannabis  is  void  as  mentioned  above,  the  consequent"
"impugned expulsion order based on the said conviction also cannot prevail in law."
"I
n such circumstances and for the reasons given above, I am inclined to issue a Writ"
"of Certiorari quashing the decision to expel the Petitioner from Sri Lanka Air Force"
"and a Writ of Mandamus ordering the Sri Lanka Air Force to reinstate the Petitioner"
