"a consequence of an incident that occurred at the Quarantine Centre, urine samples"
"of  five  Airmen,  including  the  Petitioner,  were  taken  and  tested.  The  Petitioner’s"
"sample tested positive for dangerous drugs (Cannabis). Afterwards, a charge sheet"
"was  served  on  the  Petitioner,  and  a  disciplinary  inquiry  has  been  conducted  in"
"Sections 40 and 43 of the Air Force Act. The relevant medical report was submitted"
"at the said inquiry.  Based on the evidence, the Petitioner was found guilty of the"
"charges reflected in R6 and was punished with 28 days of detention and forfeiture"
"of  pay  and  allowances  for  the  period  of  detention.  Thereafter  the  Petitioner  has"
"been expelled from the Sri Lanka Air Force by the 1st Respondent declaring that the"
"Petitioner’s  “service  no  longer  is  required”.  The  Petitioner  claims  that  the  said"
"decision  is  based  on  fictitious  grounds;  is  in  violation  of  the  Principles  of  Natural"
"Justice; 
is  adverse  to  the  Petitioner’s  Legitimate  Expectations  and  violates  the"
"principle  against  the  Duplicity  of  Punishment  (Doctrine  of  Double  Jeopardy).  The"
"Petitioner seeks inter alia mandates in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing"
"the decision to expel the Petitioner from Sri Lanka Air Force dated 03.07.2020 (P3)"
"and a Writ of Mandamus ordering the Air Force to reinstate the Petitioner with back"
"wages."
"The Petitioner’s stance is that he was falsely implicated in an incident which took"
"place  at 
the  Quarantine  Centre.  Although 
the  Petitioner  was  charged  with"
"consumption  of  cannabis,  gambling  and  failure  to  follow  verbal  orders,  he  has"
"categorically denied the charge of consumption of cannabis and the impugned urine"
"report. The Petitioner complains that the procedure followed in taking and testing"
"the  urine  samples  was  ad  hoc,  irregular  and  does  not  conform  to  the  standard"
"medical procedures. However, the Respondents state that the urine samples were"
"drawn by a qualified medical lab assistant according to the relevant protocol which"
"is marked R3."
"The  said  protocol  R3  specifies  the  Standard  Operating  Procedure  (SOS)  for  Urine"
"Analysis  for  Dangerous  Drugs  at  Sri  Lanka  Air  Force  Hospital  Katunayake.  As  per"
"clause 06 of the protocol marked R3, the result of the urine test must be informed"
"to the person who has undergone the test and his/her signature must be obtained"
"after 
inquiring  whether  the  result 
is  accepted  or  not.  Furthermore,  clause  07"
"signifies  that  if  the  individual  does  not  accept  the  positive  test  result,  necessary"
"arrangements  should  be  made  to  send  the  second  sample  to  the  Government"
