"1 WLR 1988, state as follows:"
"“The courts will, in any case, be reluctant to enter into ‘issues of academic or"
"pastoral judgment which the university was equipped to consider in breadth and in depth"
"but on which any judgment of the courts would be jejune and inappropriate. That"
"undoubtedly included such questions as what mark or class a student ought to be awarded"
"or whether an aegrotat was justified’.”"
"In  R  v.  Higher  Education Funding  Council  ex parte  Institute  of Dental  Surgery"
"(1994) 1 WLR 242, Sedley L.J. held:"
"“We would hold that where what is sought to be impugned is on the evidence no"
"more than an informed exercise of academic judgment, fairness alone will not require"
"reasons to be given. This is not to say for a moment that academic decisions are beyond"

"“
Therefore, although this Court may not interfere with purely an academic issue"
"the Court would not hesitate to intervene in any other dispute relating to academic"
