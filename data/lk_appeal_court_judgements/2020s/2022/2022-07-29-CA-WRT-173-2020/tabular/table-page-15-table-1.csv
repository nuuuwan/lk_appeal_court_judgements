"In  R.M.C.J.  Ratnayake  v.  The  Commissioner  General  of  Excise,  CA  505/2008"
"decided on 08.06.2011, his Lordship Sathya Hettige J. held:"
"“I  observe  that  the  statutory  discretion  conferred  by  the  statute  upon  the"
"functionary must be exercised by the same  authority and not by any other officer. The"
"discretion cannot be abdicated to another officer unless the statute expressly authorizes.”"
"In the instant case, by referring the matter for clarification to the Director General"
"NIBM we cannot arrive at the finding that there has been an abdication of powers. This"
"is because as stated plainly on the face of the document marked “R4” (Meeting Minutes"
"dated  05.03.2020)  it  is  stated  that  “Considering  the  facts  as  above  the  Board  decided”"
