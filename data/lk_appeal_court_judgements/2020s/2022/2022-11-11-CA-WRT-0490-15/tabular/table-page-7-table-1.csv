"The 
learned  Counsel  for  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  submitted  that  the"
"Mahaweli Authority is willing to cancel the permit that had been issued to the"
"3rd Respondent while this case was pending. The 3rd Respondent had informed"
"to court that a permit had been issued to him in his Statement of Objections on"
"10th October 2016. But so far, no step had been taken by the Mahaweli Authority"
"to cancel that permit. The 2nd Respondent Mahaweli Authority is responsible for"
"the  acts  committed  by  its  officers.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the  1st  and  2nd"
"Respondents  submitted  that  the  person  who 
issued  the  permit  to  the  3rd"
"Respondent was unaware of the pending writ application. The 1st Respondent in"
"this  application  is  the  Resident  Project  Manager  of  the  Mahaweli  Authority."
"Therefore, one cannot say that there was lack of communication between the"
"officers and the person who issued the permit was unaware of this case. The act"
"of  issuing  a  permit  to  the  3rd  Respondent  while  the  pendency  of  this  writ"
"application clearly demonstrates that the 1st and the 2nd Respondents and their"
"subordinates  were  acting  maliciously  against  the  Petitioner.  After  preventing"
"the Petitioner, who had been cultivating this land for a long period of time, from"
"cultivating the land a permit had been granted to the 3rd Respondent who was"
"never in possession in 1993 when the inquiry was held. That shows that the 1st"
"and 2nd Respondents and their subordinates had acted maliciously, unfairly and"
"unreasonably."
"For the aforementioned reasons, we issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of"
"mandamus  directing  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  to  issue  a  permit  to  the"
"Petitioner for the subject matter of this case.  It necessarily implies that the 1st"
"and 2nd Respondents will have to cancel the permit that has been already issued"
"to the 3rd Respondent as agreed upon by the learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd"
"Respondents."
