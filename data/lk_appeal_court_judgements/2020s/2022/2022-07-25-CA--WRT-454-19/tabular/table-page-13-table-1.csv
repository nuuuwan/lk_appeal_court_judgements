"basis. An estoppel may arise from silence as well as words. However,"
"to  constitute  an  ""estoppel  by  silence""  or  ""acquiescence"",  it  must"
"appear that the party to be estopped must be sound in equity and"
"good  conscience  to  speak  and  that  party  claiming  estoppel  relied"
"upon such silence or acquiescence and was misled thereby to change"
"his  position  to  his  prejudice.  In  some  circumstances,  silence  or"
"inaction  can  constitute  a  representation 
for  the  purpose  of  an"
"estoppel. This is where there is a legal duty to make a disclosure or"
"take  steps,  the  omission  of  which  is  relied  upon  as  creating  the"
"estoppel."
"In this application, it is pertinent to note that the Petitioner, without"
"any  objections  or  protest  had  paid  the  luxury  tax  imposed  by  the"
"Department of Customs and got his vehicle released. Moreover, the"
"Petitioner decided to waive off his right to appeal provided in law as"
"well. As such, it appears that the Petitionerâ€™s own conduct by way of"
"acquiescence in the proceedings operate as an estoppel."
"I  do  agree  with  the  contention  of  the 
learned  Counsel 
for  the"
"Petitioner  that  a  waiver  must  be  an  intentional  act  of  surrender of"
"rights with knowledge of what those rights are, as enunciated by the"
"Supreme Court in Abeywickrema Vs. Pathirana (1986-1SLR-120)."
"Admittedly,  the  Petitioner  in  this  application  had  not  objected  or"
"protested against the imposition of luxury tax before the Department"
"of  Customs  and  opted  not  to  prefer  an  appeal  in  terms  of  the"
"provisions  of 
the  Customs  Ordinance,  which  amounts 
to  an"
"intentional act of surrender of his rights with knowledge."
"One should keep in mind the consequences  that would flow if the"
"impugned Gazette marked X6 is quashed as prayed for. This Court"
"is mindful of the fact that since 02-08-2019 the Regulations X6 have"
"been  in  force,  and  accordingly  a  large  number  of  vehicles  have"
"already been imposed with luxury tax in accordance with the same."
"As I have already decided that the Petitioner is liable to pay luxury"
"tax  not  by  X6  but  upon  2V1.  Furthermore,  the  persons  those  who"
"have paid luxury tax in terms of X6 have not come before Court. In"
"these circumstances, if the X6 is quashed by way of Writ that would"
"bring  disastrous  consequences.
