"ultra  vires  antedated  Gazetted  Regulation  at  a  stage  when"
"such a demand was not warranted by law."
"At  the  argument  of  this  application,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitioner informed Court that he would not pursue the relief as set"
"out in paragraph “g” of the prayers to the Petition which is reiterated"
"in the forgoing paragraph No. iv."
"FACTUAL MATRIX:"
"The Petitioner imported a motor vehicle (a diesel double cab with a"
"cylinder capacity of 2800 cc) on a concessionary permit. The letter of"
"credit was opened on 04-05-2019. The Bill of Lading (X10B) and the"
"Delivery Order (X10C) pertaining to the said vehicle are dated 29-06-"
"2019 and 23-07-2019 respectively. As per the CUSDEC (X10D) the"
"vehicle  arrived  on  07-07-2019.  In  terms  of  the  impugned  Gazette"
"bearing No. 2118/24 dated 09-04-2019 (X6 or 2R3) the assessment"
"of the luxury tax on the said vehicle was made on 13-08-2019 (X10E),"
"and thereafter, the Petitioner had paid the luxury tax amounting to"
"Rs. 2,969,860/= on 27-08-2019 and got the vehicle released from the"
"Customs Department."
"The  contention  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  was  that"
"though  the  1st  Respondent  (Minister  of  Finance)  had  affixed  his"
"signature on the draft regulation of X6 on 09-04-2019, the impugned"
"Gazette  containing  the  regulations  made  by  the  Minister  has  been"
"published only on 02-08-2019. As such, the said double cab that was"
"arrived  on  07-07-2019  is  not  subject  to  the  luxury  tax  which  has"
"been imposed by X6. Hence, the learned Counsel for  the Petitioner"
"submits that the decision made by the Sri-Lanka Customs imposing"
"luxury tax on the said vehicle is ultra vires."
"The  Respondents  in  their  objections  moved  for  a  dismissal  of  the"
"Petitioner’s application on the basis inter-alia that;"
