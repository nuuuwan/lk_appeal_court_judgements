"The question which arises here is whether a party could claim relief in a judicial review"
"application against another whilst the claiming party is also at fault or his/her conduct is"
"wrongful within the same impugned process. In other words, it is whether the claiming"

"good conscience. In my view, this question can be assayed with the ‘clean hands doctrine’"
"which is usually based on the maxim of equity which states that one who claims equity"
"must come with clean hands. The other question which comes in to my mind is whether"
"this is a fit case to simply disregard the defense of unclean hands which is the root cause"
"to unreasonableness."
