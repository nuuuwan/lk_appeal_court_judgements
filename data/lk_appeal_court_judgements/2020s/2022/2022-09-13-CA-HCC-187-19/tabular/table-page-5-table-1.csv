"went to the temple on her own or whether she went with the appellant"
"at  his  request  would  be  dealt  with  later.  However,  I  cannot  see  any"
"improbability of the appellant going to the victim’s house at night and"
"asking her to come to the temple if the appellant wanted to have sex"
"with her. At the same time, I should say that there is no improbability"
"in the appellant’s version as well. However, there is no basis to accept"
"the  argument  that  the  defence  version  is  more  probable  than  the"
"prosecution  version.  Hence,  there  is  no  issue  as  to  the  probability  of"
"the prosecution story."
