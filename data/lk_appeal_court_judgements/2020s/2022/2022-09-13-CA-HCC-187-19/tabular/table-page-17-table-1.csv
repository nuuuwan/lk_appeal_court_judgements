"submitted the reasons on the same day, why the sentence should not"
"be enhanced, if the convictions are affirmed."
"Now, I consider the submissions made by both counsel regarding the"
"sentence. The minimum sentence for the second count is seven years"
"imprisonment and the maximum is twenty years. The learned counsel"
"for 
the 
appellant 
submitted 
that 
the 
learned 
trial  Judge  has"
"considered the midpoint, 12 years, of the period of imprisonment and"
"deducted one year, as the appellant had no previous convictions. The"
"learned counsel also submitted that the appellant was a priest and a"
"teacher. He also stated that no damage has been caused to the victim"
"as a result of this offence."
"The 
learned  State  Counsel 
for 
the 
respondent 
contended 
that"
"committing  this  kind  of  offence  as  a  priest  and  a  teacher  is  a  highly"
"aggravating 
factor  and 
the 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has  not"
"considered  the  same.  Advancing  on  her  argument,  the  learned  State"
"Counsel stated that this is a fit case to enhance the sentence."
"The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has  made  an  observation  before"
"passing  the  sentence  that  although  the  breach  of  discipline 
is  a"
"relevant issue in monastic life, breach of discipline by the accused is"
"not considered at all in passing the sentence. It should be noted that a"
"child  who  goes  to  a  monk,  not  like  going  to  an  ordinary  person,"
"expects guardianship and has more confidence that the monk will do"
"no harm to her. Furthermore, the accused-appellant was a teacher in"
"the  Sunday  school  and  PW1  was  a  student  there.  Hence,  it  is  my"
"considered view that sexually abusing the girl who came to the monk"
"who was also her teacher is more serious than abusing the girl by an"
"ordinary  person.  So,  this  is  an  aggravating  factor  the  learned  Judge"
"should have considered."
