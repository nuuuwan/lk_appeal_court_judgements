"reading: ""Business, employment; that which occupies the time and attention"
"and labour of men for the purpose of profit or improvement.” That is to say,"
"anything which occupies the time and attention and labour of a man for the"
"purpose  of  profit  is  business.  It  is  a  word  of  extensive  use  and  indefinite"
"signification. Then, ""Business is a particular occupation, as agriculture, trade,"
"mechanics,  art,  or  profession,  and  when  used  in  connection  with  particular"
"employments it admits of the plural that is, businesses.”"
