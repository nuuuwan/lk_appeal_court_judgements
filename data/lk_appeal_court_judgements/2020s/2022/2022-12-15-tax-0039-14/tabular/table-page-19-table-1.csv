"assessor  deals  with  the  profits  of  a  “business”  or  the 
income  of  an"
"“individual”.  Soertsz  J. held that where it is appertaining to an income of a"
"business,  it  falls  within  3(1)(a),  and  where  it  is  related  to  an  income  of  an"
"individual,  as  part  of  his  business,  it  falls  within  section  6(1)(e).  The  relevant"
"passage of the judgment at p. 252 reads as follows:"
"“The view I have reached is that the categories enumerated in section 6 (1)"
"are mutually exclusive, and that the question whether 6 (1) (a) or 6 (1) (e)"
"applies  in  a  particular  case,  depends on  whether  we  are  dealing  with  the"
"profits of a business or the income of an individual. If it is a case of dividends,"
"interests, or discounts appertaining to a business, they fall within the words"
"“profits of any business” and section (6) (1)(a) applies. If, however, it is a case"
"of dividends, interest or discounts accruing to an individual not, in the course"
"of  a  business,  but  as  a  part  of  his  income  from  simple  investments,  then"
"section 6 (1) (e) is the relevant section, and so far as interest is concerned,"
"section 9 (3) modifies section 9 (1)” (Emphasis added)."
"[50]  The  above  passage  of  the 
judgment  of  Soertsz  J.  suggests  that  the"
"following  test  would  apply  to  identify  whether  the  profits  and  income  of  an"
"individual or business fall within section 3(1)(a) or 3(1) (e):"
"1. 
If  the  profits  or  income  received  from  dividends  or  interest  or  discounts"
"appertains to the business, it will fall within the profits of any business under"
"section 6(1)(a);"
"2. 
If  the  profits  or  income  received  from  dividends  or  interest  or  discounts"
"accruing to an individual was earned, not in the course of a business, but"
"as  a  part  of  his  income  from  simple  investments,  it  falls  within  section"
"3(1)(e)."
"[51] The test applied by Soertsz J. that section 6(1)(e) is limited to an income of"
"an “individual” and section 6(1)(a) is limited to the profits of any “business” is"
"not, in my view  consistent with the  scheme  of the  IRA 2006, which does not"
"restrict the application of section 3(1)(e) to an individual. In my view, the tests"
"laid down by Howard CJ., and Keuneman J., are significant to identify the source"
"of  profits  or  income  under  which  chargeability  arises  and  to  decide  in  what"
"circumstances,  will  the  dividends,  interest  or  discounts  be  a  source  under"
"section 3(a) or 3(e). The identification of the source of profits or income is also"
"significant to apply the general rule of deduction under section 25(1) or special"
"rules  of  deduction  under  section  25(1)(a)-(w)  of  the  IRA  2006  to  particular"
"sources  or  profits  or  income,  irrespective  of  whether  the  source  falls  under"
