"6(1)(e). In order to determine this question, Howard C.J. laid down the following"
"test at page 250 of the judgment:"
"“If the business of a company consists in the receipt of dividends, interest or"
"discounts alone or if such a business can be clearly separated from the rest of"
"the  trade  or  business,  then  any  special  provisions  applicable  to  dividends,"
"interest or discounts must be applied.  Applying the principle laid down in the"
"Egyptian case, the appellant company is within source (e) and cannot get out"
"of  it.  To  take  such  a  view  does  not  in  any  way  disturb  the  scheme  of  the"
"Ordinance. I agree, therefore, with Keuneman J. that the Commissioner was"
"empowered to charge the appellant Company under section 6 (1) (e) in respect"
"of the dividends and interest received from undertakings in which its capital"
"was invested” (Emphasis added)."
