"6(1)(e) in respect of dividends and interest received in the production of profits"
"and income under section 9(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance."
"[39]  As  far  the  deduction  of  management  expenses  in  relation  to  dividends,"
"which 
the  company  obtained  was  concerned,  Keuneman 
J. 
rejected 
the"
"submission of the Crown that the company has not done anything to produce"
"the  income  or  profits  under  section  9(1).  Keuneman  J.,  held  that  section  9(1)"
"“would therefore prima facie apply to all the sources in section 6(1)(a) to (h)” (p."
"21). Keuneman J., further rejected the argument of the Crown that nothing has"
"been done by the company to produce the income or profits, and held that “the"
"management  expenses”  claimed 
in 
the  case  have  been 
incurred 
in 
the"
"production  of 
the 
income.  Keuneman 
J., 
further  held 
that  management"
"expenses  incurring  in  the  production  of  income  can  be  deducted  from  any"
"source, 
including 
from  source  6(1)(e)  and  agreed  with  Keuneman  J.  that"
"management  expenses  incurred  by  the  company  could  be  deducted  under"
"section 9(1) of the Income Tax ordinance."
"[40] Keuneman J. decided that the management expenses can be deducted as"
"far as they relate to the dividends which the company obtained in producing"
"the profits or income under section 9(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance 1932."
"Expenses incurred in the production of interest-special considerations"
"[41] It was the opinion of Keuneman J. that though the interest can be a separate"
"source  under  section  6(1)(e),  that  source 
is  subject  to  “all  outgoings  and"
"expenses incurred ……in the production of the profits or income”, and thus, they"
"must  be  deducted.    Keuneman  J.  then  turned  to  the  deduction  of  interest"
"income  earned  by  the  company  and  referred  to  section  9(1)  and  9(3)  of  the"
"Income Tax Ordinance. Section 9(1) refers to the deductions for the purpose of"
"ascertaining the profits or income from any source, all outgoings and expenses"
"incurred  by  any  person  in  the  production  thereof  and  section  9(3)  refers  to"
"income  arising 
from  separate 
interest,  whether  paid  or  not,  without  any"
"deduction for outgoings or expenses."
"[42]  Keuneman  J.  held  that  had  the  earning  of  interest  been  the  sole  and"
"separate  business  of  the  company,  the  special  provision  in  section  9(3)"
"(correspond  to  section  25(4)  of  the 
IRA  2006)  would  apply.  Keuneman  J."
"however, refused to apply the special provision in section 9(3) on the basis that"
"the  company  carried  on  one  business,  which  has  two  branches,  viz.  the"
"earning  of  dividends  and  earning  of 
interest,  but  the 
interest 
is  only  a"
