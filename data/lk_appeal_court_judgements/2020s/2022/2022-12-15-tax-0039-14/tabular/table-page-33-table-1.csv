"[96] The combined reading of sections 2 and 3, and shows that income tax is to"
"be charged at the rate or rates prescribed in the IRA 2006 on the “all profits and"
"income” of the person as defined in section   2(1) of the IRA 2006 and computed"
"from  the  “all  profits  and  income”  of  such  person  in  the  words  of  Viscount"
"Dunedin in Salisbury House Estate v. Fly (1930) 15 T.C. 266:"
"“Now, the cardinal consideration in my judgment is that the income tax is only"
"one tax, a tax on the income of the person whom it is sought to assess, and"
"that the different schedules are modes in which the Statute directs this to be"
"levied”."
"[97] Viscount Dunedin, J. further stated that “there are no separate taxes under"
"the various schedules but only one tax. But in order to arrive at the total income"
"on which tax is to be charged, you have to consider the nature, the constituent"
"parts,  of  his  (assessee’s)  income  to  see  which  schedule  you  are  to  apply”.  Sir"
"George Rankin in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Chunilal B. Metha (1938) 6 I.T.R."
