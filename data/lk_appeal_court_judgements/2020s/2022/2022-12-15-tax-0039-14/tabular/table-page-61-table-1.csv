"","4.  Yes,  all  judges  in  the  CFI  case  did  not  say  that  section  9(3)  should  be"
"","uniformly  applied  to  all  interest  received.  Howard  C.J.  said  that  if  the"
"","business  of  a  company  consists  in  the  receipt  of  dividends,  interest  or"
"","discounts alone, or if such a business can be clearly separated from the"
"","rest  of  the  trade  or  business,  special  provisions  under  section  9(3)  will"
"","apply to such dividends, interest or discounts. Kenueman J. also said if the"
"","business  of  a  company  consists  in  the  receipt  of  dividends,  interest  or"
"","discounts alone, or if such a business can be clearly separated from the"
"","rest of the trade or business, then any special provisions under section 9(3)"
"","applies to such dividends, interest or discounts. As regards the deduction"
"","of management expenses incurred in relation to dividends, Kenueman J."
"","held that management expenses had been incurred in the production of"
"","the  income  and  are  necessary  and  reasonable  expenses,  and  can  be"
"","deducted under section 9(1). As regards, the deduction of interest earned"
"","by the company, Kenueman J. held that where the earning of interest has"
"","been the sole and separate business of the company, the special provision"
"","in section 9(3) would apply and if not, the ordinary rule under section 9(1)"
"","of the Income Tax Ordinance would apply, and the deductions claimed can"
"","be allowed in their entirety. Only Soertsz J. said that so far as interest is"
"","concerned,  the  special  rule  in  section  9(3)  modifies  the  general  rule  in"
"","section 9(1). Justice De Krester agreed with Justice Soertsz."
"5.","(a) The rule in section 99 is not intended to deny tax exemption granted"
"","to  an  assessee  where  his  source  falls  within  the  words  “profits  from"
"","business, trade, profession or vocation” under section 3(a), and allow the"
"","exemption where the source falls within the terms “dividends, interest or"
"","discounts”. It recognises the principle that where any item falls specifically"
"","under one head, it has to be charged under that head and no other. The"
"","answer to question of law No. 4 further apples."
"","(b) The above answer applies."
