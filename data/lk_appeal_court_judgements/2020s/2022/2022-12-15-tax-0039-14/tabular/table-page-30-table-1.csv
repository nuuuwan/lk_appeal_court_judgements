"[87] Now the question is whether the exemption claimed by the Appellant under"
"section 9 applies to the source of profits and income earned by the Appellant"
"under section 3(e) of the IRA 2006 only, or  where the source of income falls"
"exclusively under section 3(a), the exemption under section 9 is inapplicable to"
"the Appellant. In other words, the question is whether, the classification of the"
"interest  as  business  profits  under  section  3(a)  precludes  the  Appellant  from"
"claiming the benefit to the exemption under section 9 of the IRA 2006."
"[88] The TAC in its determination first held that the legislature did not intend to"
"grant special benefits to a specific bank, such as the Appellant under section 9"
"(b)  and  9(d)  and  disallowed  the  exemption  claimed  by  the  Appellant  under"
"section  9(b)  and  9(d).  The  TAC  further  held  that  the  banks  fall  into  a  special"
"category  due  to  the  requirements  provided  for  in  section  2  of  the  Banking"
"(Amendment) Act, No. 33 of 1995. The TAC further said that distinct provisions"

"and those incorporated outside Sri Lanka.  The TAC held that therefore, unless"
"the legislature specifically exempted specific banks such as the Appellant from"
"section 9 of the IRA, 2006, it is not entitled to the exemptions under section 9."
