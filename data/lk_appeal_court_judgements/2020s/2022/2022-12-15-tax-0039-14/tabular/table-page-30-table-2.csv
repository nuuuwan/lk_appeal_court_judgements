"the legislature specifically exempted specific banks such as the Appellant from"
"section 9 of the IRA, 2006, it is not entitled to the exemptions under section 9."
"The TAC at pp. 26-27 stated:"
"“On considering the provisions of section 9 (b) which deals with exemptions"
"from income tax of interest accruing to any “COMPANY”, section 9(d) refers"
"to  ANY  PERSON  dealing  in  a  specialized  activity  such  as  banking,  which"
"appears  to  have  been  given  a  special  meaning  vide  the  provisions  of  the"
"Banking (Amendment) Act, No. 33 of 1995 to mean “the business of receiving"
"of  funds  through  acceptance  of  money  deposits  payable  upon  demand  by"
"cheque, draft or otherwise and the use of such funds either in whole or in part"
"for  advances  or  any  operation  either  authorized  by  law  or  by  customary"
"banking  practices”  clearly  showing  that  “BANKS  FALL 
INTO  A  SPECIAL"
"CATEGORY  DUE  TO  REQUIREMENTS  PROVIDED  FOR 
IN  SECTION  2"
"THEREOF.  In  that  content  it  appears  reasonable  to  assume  that,  had  the"
"legislature intended to exempt interest as claimed by the Appellant the former"
"could have specifically done so vide provisions in the Inland Revenue Act itself."
"This contention appears apparent when we consider the provisions relating to"
"incorporation of banks in Sri Lanka and those incorporated outside Sri Lanka."
"The  requirements  are  clearly  different.  If  the  legislature  intended  special"
"benefits to a specific bank, such provision as stated above could have been"
"inserted in the Act itself”."
