"tax under a different head. It is not possible to contend that where income falls"
"under more than one head and say that the assessee has the option to choose"
"the head which makes the burden on his shoulders lighter and rely on the other"
"source."
"[103] The intention of the legislature in introducing section 99 is to recognize"
"the principle that (i) each head of income of which source has its characteristics"
"for income tax purposes and falls under one specific head under section 3 of"
"the Act; and (ii) where any item falls specifically under one head, it has to be"
"charged  under  that  head  and  no  other.  In  other  words,  the  principle  under"
"section 99 is intended to deny any option to the assessee or the assessor to"
"elect any particular head under section 3 and prevent the assessor to charge"
"the tax on any of the sources which may be chosen by the assessor because"
"each head being, specific to cover the item arising from a particular source."
"[104] Both precedent and on a proper construction of the scheme of the Act,"
"the income from interest would fall under section 3(a) as it is chargeable within"
"the terms “profits from business” and therefore, it cannot be brought under a"
"different  source  [(section  3(e)].    This  would  mean  that  once  an  activity  is"
"properly  characterized  as  a  business,  trade  or  profession  or  vocation  under"
"section 3(a), such characterization cannot be changed by the taxpayer, assessor"
"and brought under a different source referred to in section 3 for the purpose of"
"determination of profits or income of such person. The principle in section 99"
"is important in computing profits from a specified source in section 3 since a"
"particular taxing rule will apply exclusively to that rule, and it cannot be brought"
"under a different provision in section 3 to which a different rule applies."
"[105] The rule in section 99 is not intended to deny the exemption granted to"
"an assessee where his source falls within the words “profits from business, trade,"
"profession or vocation” under section 3(a) and allow the exemption only where"
"his  source  falls  within  the  terms  “dividends,  interest  or  discount”.  Such  an"
"interpretation is absurd and mischievous to the true intention of the legislature"
"expressed in the IRA 2006. It permits the assessor to charge the tax on all profits"
"and income from whatever source derived subject, however, to the provisions"
"of the Act, which includes tax exemptions."

"exempt income in a taxing statute as follows:"
