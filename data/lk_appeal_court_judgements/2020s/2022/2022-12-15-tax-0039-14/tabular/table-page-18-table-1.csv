"expenses claimed arising from interest was allowed as outgoings and expenses"
"incurred in the production of the income under section 9(1), which corresponds"
"to section 25(1) of the IRA 2006."
"[46] Applying the said principles of law, Keuneman J. finally allowed the appeal"
"and deducted the management expenses incurred in the production of income"
"in relation to dividends and interest in ascertaining the assessable income of"
"the company under section 9(1) (corresponding to section 25(1) of the IRA)."
"[47] The combined effect of the test applied by Howard CJ., and Keuneman J."
"(with  Wijewardene,  J.  agreed)  was  that  â€œif  the  business  of  a  company  or"
"individual consists in the receipts of dividends, interests or discounts alone, or"
"if such business can be clearly separated from the rest of the trade, business,"
"then section 3(1)(e) will apply. In other words, if the business of a company or"
"an individual consists in the receipts of dividends, interest or discounts and such"
"business cannot be separated from the rest of the trade or business, and the"
"interest is embedded in the business, such interest or dividends or discounts"
"falls within the meaning of section 3(1(a) of the Act."
