"Investigate Allegations Of Bribery Or Corruption (supra), where it was stated"
"by Ranjith Silva, J. after considering several legal principles that;"
"“ By the same token the same principle should apply and guide the judges"
"in  the  assessment  of  the  evidence  of  the  excise  officers  in  narcotic  cases."
"Judges  must  not  rely  on  a  non-existent  presumption  of  truthfulness  and"
"regularity as regards the evidence of such trained police or excise officers."
"I would also like to refer to the book entitled The Law of Evidence Volume 2"
"Book 1 at page 395 by E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy dealing with how the police"
"evidence in bribery cases should be considered. It states as follows; ‘In the"
"great many cases, the police agents are, as a rule unreliable witnesses. It"
"is  always  in  their  interest  to  secure  a  conviction  in  the  hope  of  getting  a"
"reward.  Such  evidence  ought,  therefore,  to  be  received  with  great  caution"
"and should be closely scrutinized. Particularly where their evidence is the"
"only corroborating evidence of the evidence of the accomplice.’ ’’"
