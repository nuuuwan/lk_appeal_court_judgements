"conducted the raid was a material deficiency in the prosecution evidence. It is"
"clear from the evidence of PW-01 that it was the Director of the PNB who has"
"received  the  specific  information  in  relation  to  the  three  passengers  travelling"
"from India and that they are carrying dangerous drugs. The Director has passed"
"that information to the officer-in-charge of the Katunayake Unit of the PNB and"
"PW-01 has acted on the instructions of the OIC. I do not find anything sinister"
"in the actions of PW-01 and his officers to pursue the information further and to"
"arrest the appellant and two others who accompanied him on suspicion. In fact,"
"the appellant has never denied that he was stopped and arrested while leaving"
"the airport as stated by PW-01."
"Similarly, the challenge to the evidence of PW-01 where he has stated that he"
"and his officers had the photographs and other details of the appellant and the"
"other two passengers which enabled them to identify the appellant at the airport"
"is  not  a  matter  that  can  be  doubted.  It  is  very  much  probable  that  the  PNB"
"officers have obtained the assistance of the immigration authorities since they"
"were  possessed  of  this  information  well  in  advance,  and  had  obtained  the"
"relevant details for their investigations beforehand. If one reads the evidence of"
"PW-01 and 02, it becomes clear that they had the relevant information before"
"the arrest was made."
"Although there is a reference by PW-01 at page 486 of the brief that the witness"
"obtained the photographs of the appellant from the Department of Immigration"
"and Emigration on 08th October 2007, that is ten days after the raid, it is clear"
"that he was referring to the photographs he had in his hand when giving evidence"
"in Court. It becomes clear that those photographs are photographs that had been"
"taken subsequently by the PNB and not the photographs used by PW-01 for his"
"raid. PW-01 and 02 have given clear evidence as to how they identified the two"
"bags belonging to the appellant out of the three bags the appellant and the other"
"person  was  taken  in  the  trolley.  At  nowhere  in  this  case  the  appellant  has"
"challenged  the  identification  of  the  bags  when  the  relevant  witnesses  gave"
"evidence."
