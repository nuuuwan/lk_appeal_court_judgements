"It was his position that there was unchallenged evidence at the High Court trial"
"that, apart from identifying the bags belonging to the appellant, the bag which"
"was found with a false bottom and the drugs hidden had a combination lock and"
"a key was in the possession of the appellant, and it was the appellant who opened"
"the bags using the combination."
"He also pointed out the defence taken up by the appellant when the witnesses"
"gave evidence, which was that a part of the Heroin found in the possession of"
"the  female  called  Shamalee  was  introduced  to  him,  and  the  position  of  the"
"appellant in his dock statement where his contention appeared to be that PNB"
"officers 
introduced  another  bag  upon 
the  appellant  and  he  was 
falsely"
"implicated."
"The learned DSG also made submissions regarding the issues which led to the"
"non-production  of  some  of  the  items  taken  into  custody  from  the  bag  of  the"
"appellant due to them being mixed up and misplaced at the Magistrate Court."
"He also explained the issue that came up with regard to the baggage tag where"
"it was found to be attached with a pin to other documents. He also points out"
"that the appellant has never challenged at the trial that the bag produced in the"
"courts was not his."
"The learned DSG was also of the view that this was an information regard to the"
"trafficking of Heroin received by the Director of PNB, which has been passed on"
"to the OIC of the Katunayake Unit of the PNB and PW-01 has acted only on his"
"instructions. 
It  was  his  position 
that  not  making  separate  notes  on 
the"
"information received was not a matter that can create any doubt, given the facts"
"and the circumstances."
