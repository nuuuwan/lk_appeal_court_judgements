"","An allied point that the Appellant sought to raise was the inadequacy of reasons to",""

"Revenue Act, the Legislature has in its wisdom cast a duty on an Assessor when he rejects","",""

"because it will depend on the circumstances of each case.","",""
"","The adequacy of reasons to discharge this statutory burden then has to be judged in",""
