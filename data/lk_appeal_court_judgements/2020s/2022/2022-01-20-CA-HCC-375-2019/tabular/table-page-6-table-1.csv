"Another argument pursued by the learned Counsel for the appellant was that"
"since  the  learned  trial  judge  has  failed  to  analyze  the  charges  against  the"
"appellant separately, the judgment cannot be considered as a proper judgment"
"in terms of section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act."
"It  was  the  contention  of  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  (DSG)  for  the"
"Attorney  General  that  although  the  learned  trial  judge  has  used  the  word"
"‘ච ෝදනාව’  at  the  commencement  of  his  judgment,  it  is  abundantly  clear  from"
"the  judgment  that  all  the  charges  against  the  appellant  has  been  considered"
"separately.  It  was  contended  that  the  learned  trial  judge  has  not  shifted  the"
"burden  to  the  appellant  and  he  was  well  aware  of  the  governing  principles  of"
"evidence when he considered the evidence in the judgment."
"Relying on the judgment of Achala Wengappuli, J. in the case of A.W.Haprul"
"Asad and another Vs. The Attorney General C.A. Case No-91-2013 decided"
"on  21-06-2019  it  was  his  contention  that  since  this  was  a  clear  situation"
"where  the  actions  of  the  appellant  come  within  the  4th  limb  of  section  294  of"
"the  Penal  Code,  the  judgment  of  the  learned  High  Court  judge  should  stand"
"affirmed."
"First Ground of Appeal: -"
"The 
learned  Counsel 
for  the  appellants  contention  that  PW-01  was  not  a"
"credible  witness  appears  to  have  been  based  on  what  he  has  said  as  to  the"
"location  of  the  roads  and  the  distances  when  he  gave  evidence  and  what"
"happened  when  he  and  his  mother  went  near  the  house  of  the  appellant  in"
"order  to  meet  him.  I  find  that  due  to  the  lengthy  evidence  in  chief  and  cross"
"examination as to the locations of the roads and the distances, the witness has"
"been  confused 
in  giving  his  evidence.  However,  since 
the  appellant  had"
"admitted  that  it  was  the  lorry  driven  by  him  that  hit  the  deceased  and  the"
"injured,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  mentioned  infirmities  have  no  relevance  to"
"the facts in issue."
