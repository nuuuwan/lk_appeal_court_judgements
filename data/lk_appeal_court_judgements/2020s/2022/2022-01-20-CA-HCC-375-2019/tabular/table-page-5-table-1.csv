"his  evidence  that  before  he  could  go  near  the  lorry  which  was  parked  on  the"
"road,  he  was  informed  that  there  is  a  person  entangled  under  the  lorry.  The"
"witness  has  taken  steps  to  get  the  person  released  and  has  observed  that  he"
"was still alive. However, he has been informed by the hospital authorities that"
"he  has  passed  away  upon  admission.  Later  he  has  come  to  know  that  the"
"person found entangled to the undercarriage of the lorry was a police constable"
"named Silva attached to Modara Police."
"The  Judicial  Medical  Officers  who  have  given  evidence 
in 
this  case  has"
"confirmed  that  the  causes  of  death  of  the  two  deceased  persons,  namely,  P"
"Nishantha Silva and G Wasantha Jayalal Silva and injuries to the four injured"
"persons were due to a road traffic accident."
"When  called 
for  a  defence  at  the  conclusion  of  the  prosecution  case,  the"
"appellant  has  made  a  statement  from  the  dock.  He  has  stated  that  he  was"
"playing  a  game  of  cards  with  others  at  about  9.30  pm  on  the  day  of  the"
"incident at his house. It was his statement that as his wife wanted him to go to"
"Luckysevenpura  and  pick  her  mother,  and  it  was  for  that  purpose  he  left  his"
"house in his lorry. After reaching the main road and while proceeding towards"
"Panadura  by  the  left  lane  of  the  road,  he  has  seen  a  crowd  of  persons  on  the"
"pavement and when he reached that point about 25-30 persons fell on to the"
"road 
leaving  no  room 
for  him  to  avoid  collusion  with  them,  although  he"
"attempted  to  take  the  lorry  to  the  right  side  of  the  road.  He  has  stated  that"
"although he initially stopped the vehicle, due to the fear of being assaulted he"
"left the place and went to the Panadura Police and informed what happened."
"Grounds of Appeal: -"
"The main  contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant is that this was"
"an  unavoidable  accident  and  not  an 
intentional  act,  since 
there  was  no"
"animosity between the deceased and the injured.  It was contended further that"
"the evidence of PW-01 was not credible in that regard."
