"credit on local purchases against output tax and refunds claimed in its VAT"
"returns."
"[
3] The Senior Assessor by letter dated 30.08.2007 rejected the same on the"
"following grounds:"
"1.  The supply of fuel to vessels cannot be treated as an export since the"
"supplier himself has not exported such goods. Under the VAT Act, a"
"foreigner buying goods in Sri Lanka and taking them to his country is"
"not treated as an export even if the payment is received in foreign"
"currency;"
"2.  An  export  cusdec  is  not  conclusive  evidence  of  an  export  for  the"
"purpose of VAT. It cannot be treated as a zero-rated supply;"
"3.  The supply of bunker fuel is exempt from VAT in terms of Item (viii)"
"of the First Schedule to the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002 and therefore,"
"the input tax credit on such supply is not claimable;"
