"substance""  and  ""aspect""  of  custom  levy,  as  regards  both  imports  and"
"exports in terms of restrictions, prohibition and permissibility are different"
"and distinct from the charging of VAT under the VAT Act."
"[140] The learned counsel for the Appellant submits that the definition of"
"""export"" as defined in Section 22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act"
"does not include ""place of destination” but only “Taking out of Sri Lanka or"
"causing to be carried or taken out of Sri Lanka” and, therefore, the concept"
"of destination on the supply of bunker fuel to a ship is clearly beyond the"
"ambit of the VAT Act. In my view, Section 22 of the Imports and Exports"
"(Control) Act or the Customs Ordinance has no overriding effect over the"
"provisions of the VAT Act and the imposition of taxes under the provisions"
"of  the  said  Acts  are  based  on  different  principles  and  the  fulfilment  of"
"different conditions."
"[141] If the Legislature intended to apply the same term “export” for the"
"purpose of Section 7 of the VAT Act, the Legislature could have easily used"
"the  same  meaning  as  defined  in  Section  22  of  the  Imports  and  Exports"
"(Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969. Thus, the argument of the Appellant that since"
"the place of destination is not specifically mentioned in the definition of"
"""export"" in Section 22  of the Ordinance has Imports and Exports (Control)"
"Act, it will give rise to the inference that Legislature intended not make the"
"concept  of  destination  as  a  requirement  of  export  for  the  purposes  of"
"Section 7 of the VAT Act,  is without substance."
"[142] This case  is not concerned about  the  imposition of  levy  under  the"
"Imports and Exports (Control) Act or the Customs Ordinance, and  we are"
"dealing  with the imposition of  VAT under  the VAT Act. This Court  is not"
"inclined to apply the principles of the imposition of levy under the Imports"
"and Exports (Control) Act or  the Customs  Ordinance to a case of export"
"under Section  7 (1) (a) of the VAT Act."
