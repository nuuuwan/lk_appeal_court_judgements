"[147] Firstly, the publication contains guidelines or recommendations and"
"therefore,  Sri  Lanka  is  not  obliged  to  adhere  to  them.  Secondly,  these"
"guidelines  or recommendations  cannot change the principles  of income"
"tax specified in the Inland Revenue Act of Sri Lanka. Thirdly, the guidelines"
"first  classify 
the  bunker 
fuel  supplied 
to 
foreign  vessels  within 
the"
"economic territory as exports. They also classify the bunker fuel supplied"
"by  national  vessels  to  foreign  vessels  outside  the  economic  territory  as"
"exports. Thirdly, they classify the bunker fuel supplied to vessels that are"
"landed in foreign ports."
"[148] It is my view, that the classification is based on the nationality of the"
"vessel which is not the basis on which the concept of export is decided in"
"the Inland Revenue Act of Sri Lanka. Fourthly, paragraph 1.42 states that"
"when goods are taken out of the territory of a country, the goods should"
"be  treated  as  simply  being  transported  to  a  third  country  where  the"
"destination  of  a  foreign  country  is  known.  It  seems  that  the  guidelines"
"themselves, recognize that where the destination is known, the goods may"
"be said to have been transported to a foreign country.  For those reasons,"
"I am of the view that the UN Report will not support the contention of the"
"Appellant in the present case."
"Destination Principle"
"[149]  VAT  is  generally  applied  on  a  transaction-by-transaction  basis  and"
"the supply of goods is in principle subject to VAT in the jurisdiction where"
"the  goods  are  located  at  the  time  of  the  transaction  and,  and  when  a"
"transaction 
involves  goods  being  moved 
from  one 
jurisdiction  to"
"another, 
the  destination  principle 
applies.  Under 
the  destination"
"principle,  exports  are  not  subject  to  VAT,  and  suppliers  are  allowed  a"
"refund of input VAT. The exported goods are free of VAT in the supplierâ€™s"
"jurisdiction as  specified in Section 7 (1)  (a) of the  VAT Act.  If  the present"
"transaction  of 
the  Appellant 
involves  goods  being  moved 
from  one"
"jurisdiction  to  another,  the  destination  principle  applies  and  under  the"
"destination principle, the element of export is satisfied when the foreign"
"destination  point  is  intended  and  indicated  in  the  relevant  documents"
"submitted by the Appellant."
