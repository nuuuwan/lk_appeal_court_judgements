"necessarily render it an export within the meaning of Section 7 (1) (a) of the"
"VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002."
"License under the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act, No. 28 of 1961"
"[123]  The  Appellant  argues  that  the  Appellant  possesses  a  license  under"
"Section  5B  of  the  Ceylon  Petroleum  Corporation  Act,  No.  28  of  1961  to"
"import,  export,  sell,  supply  or  distribute  marine  gas,  oil  and  furnace  oil"
"(Vide- paragraph 43 of the written submissions tendered on behalf of the"
"Appellant  on  18.10.2019).  In  my  view,  the  license  granted  by  the  Ceylon"
"Petroleum  Corporation  under  Section  5B  of 
the  Ceylon  Petroleum"
"Corporation Act, No. 28 of 1961 does not necessarily mean that the supply"
"of bunker fuel shall be treated as an export within the meaning of Section"
"7 (1) (a) of the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002."
"Central Bank Annual Reports"
"[124] The Appellant relies heavily on the Annual Reports of the Central Bank"
"for  the  year  2011  in  table  3.4  at  page  63,  which,  the  Appellant  claims"
"distinguishes between exports and local sales and table 3.4 which lists the"
"Appellant  as  a  source  for  both  imports  and  export  data.  The  Appellant"
"submits that the Report supports his contention that the supply of bunker"
"fuel has been recognized as an export by the Central Bank. In my view, the"
"table 3.4 does not support the contention that the it distinguishes between"
"exports  and 
local  sales  or  that  the  Central  Bank  has  recognized  the"
"Appellant as an exporter within the meaning of any statute as claimed by"
"the Appellant."
"[125]  The  Appellant  relies  on  the  New  Zeeland  Court  of  Appeal  case  in"
"Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue  v.  International  Importing  Limited  (1972)"
"NZLR 1095 in support its position that the word “export” is complete when"
"(i) taking the goods out of the country and (ii) sending them or causing them"
"to be sent out. The question in the said case was whether, for the purposes"
"of Section 129B of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, the goods sold by a"
"""duty free shop” operated by respondent company, to travelers departing"
"overseas,  and 
the  subsequent  carriage  of 
those  goods  beyond  New"
"Zealand by the purchasers, constituted the ""export” of those goods by the"
"company, entitling it to the deduction given for income tax purposes by s"
"129B.  Section129B of the said Act reads as follows:"
