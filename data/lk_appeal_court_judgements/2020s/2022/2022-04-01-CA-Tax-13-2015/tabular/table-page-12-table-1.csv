"“","Now the distinction between matters that are directory and matters that","",""
"","are imperative is well known to us all in the common language of the courts","",""
"","at Westminster. I am not sure that it is the most fortunate language that","",""
"","could have been adopted to express the idea that it is intended to convey;","",""
"","but still, that is the recognized language, and I propose to adhere to it. The","",""
"","real question in all these cases is this: A thing has been ordered by","",""
"","the legislature to be done. What is the consequence if it is not","",""
"","done? In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have","",""
"","decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that","",""
"","follow  upon  it  are  all  voids.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  Courts  hold  a","",""
"","provision  to  be  mandatory  or  directory,  they  say  that,  although  such","",""
"","provision may not have been complied with,  the subsequent proceedings","",""
"","do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one.","",""
"","There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they","",""
"","are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material","",""
"","importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the legislature","",""
"","could have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed","",""
"","by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are","",""
"","some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite view,","",""
"","and  would  feel  that  they  are  matters  which  must  be  strictly  obeyed,","",""
"","otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow must come to an","",""

the","intention  of","the",""
