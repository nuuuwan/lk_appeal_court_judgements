"","depends  on  the  answer  to  the  question:  What  operation  is  it  that  the"
"Section is obviously designed to subsidize? Turner J, at pp  1097 stated:",""
"","“The section contains no definition of ""export” nor can it be contended that"
"","this word is a term of art. It must therefore be given its ordinary meaning, or"
"","perhaps I should say one of its ordinary meanings, to be selected according"
"","to context. Clearly, if it is  given  one of its  ordinary meanings the  travelers"
"","may be said to have ""exported” the goods themselves, for they carried them"
"","(if small enough) onto the plane personally, keeping them in their possession"
"","while the plane flew out of New Zealand. And no different result follows in"
"","the case of the larger packages which were put into the plane's hold, of which"
"the  passenger-purchasers  doubtless  must  be  deemed","to  have  had"
"","possession at the time when they were taken out of the country. But should"
"","the word ""export” so be read, as referring to what these people did, if proper"
"","regard is had to the context in which that word is found in s 129B, and if the"
"","acknowledged  purpose  of  that  section  is  remembered?  The  legislation  is"
"","plainly  addressed  to  those  persons,  and  to  those  alone,  who  increase  the"
"","foreign  exchange  reserves  of  New  Zealand,  by  sending  goods  abroad,  or"
"","causing  them  to  be  sent  abroad,  receiving  in  return  foreign  exchange  for"
"","which they are bound to account, and do account, to the Reserve Bank. It is"
"","clear that even if the travelers may be regarded as themselves ""exporting”"
"","the goods, the word ""export” where used in the section must also clearly be"
"","applicable  to  those,  such  as  respondent  company,  who  send  the  goods"
"","abroad, or cause them to be sent, with this result. Surely a dairy company"
"","""exports” butter, and a fruit cannery ""exports” its manufactures, whether it"
"","ships the goods to its own order in another country, or sells here f.o.b. to a"
"","foreign person or corporation, provided simply that the transaction is one"
"","in which it causes goods to be sent abroad in exchange for foreign currency"
"","which it receives and for which it accounts. it is to be observed however"
"","that  s.  129B  is  solely  concerned  with  the  actions  of  vendors.  In  our"
"","opinion a vendor may export either by taking or by sending. There will"
"","be many cases where it can be said that the buyer exports by taking, as"
"for example in the case of an ordinary contract”.",""
