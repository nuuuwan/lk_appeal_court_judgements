"[167] The Appellant has claimed the input credit refund  in excess of the"
"amount due under the VAT Act and the disallowance of input credit by the"
"Assessor was the result of the determination made by him that the supply"
"of bunker fuel was a local supply, and not a zero-rated supply, and thus,"
"the  Assessor  has  treated  the  supply  of  bunker  as  an  exempt  supply  on"
"which input tax is not claimable."
"[168] The Assessor is entitled to make an assessment under Section 22 (8)"
"of the VAT Act notwithstanding the provisions of Section 33, in respect of"
"any refund in excess of the amount due, or any excess amount of input"
"tax  claimed  by  the  Appellant  under  the  VAT  Act.  The  Assessor  in  the"
"present  case  has  exercised  such  a  special  power  given  to  him  under"
"section 22 (8) of the VAT Act.  In the result, the Appellantâ€™s contention that"
"Section 22 (8) of the VAT Act does not apply where the excess input credit"
"claim is collateral to the basis of the assessment is untenable. I hold that"
"the assessments made for the periods ending prior to November 2004 are"
"not time-barred under the provisions of the VAT Act."
"[169]  The  Appellant  has  further  raised  the  issue  of  non-service  of  the"
"notice  of  assessment  prior  to  the  expiry  of  the  statutory  time  bar  for"
"making an assessment. The Senior Assessor by letter dated 30.08.2007 has"
"given reasons for not accepting the returns and the notices of assessment"
"had been sent to the Appellant on 13.11.2007. As the assessments have"
"been issued under Section 22 (8) of the VAT Act, the time bar referred to in"
"Section 33 of the VAT Act is not applicable in making the assessment in the"
"present case."
"Conclusion & Opinion of Court"
"[170] In these circumstances, I answer Questions of Law arising in the Case"
"Stated against the Appellant and in favour of the Respondent as follows:"
