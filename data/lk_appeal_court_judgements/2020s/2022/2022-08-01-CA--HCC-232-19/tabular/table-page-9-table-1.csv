"For the reasons stated above, I hold that the second count against the"
"appellant has also not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt."
"Accordingly,  I  allow  the  appeal  and  set  aside  the  conviction  and"
"sentence  dated  22.03.2019  imposed  on  the  second  count  by  the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  and  direct  that  the  accused-appellant  be"
"acquitted of the Second Count."
