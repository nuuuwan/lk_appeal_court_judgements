"under sub-section 28(1) (a) (2) of the Act No. 04 of 2015, the accused has been directed"
"to pay to the fund established under Section 29 of the Act"
"On behalf of the accused-appellant the learned counsel requested that the sentence imposed on"
"the accused-appellant be reduced and the mandatory imprisonment be imposed from the date of"
"this judgment."
"The learned counsel for the respondent says that when considering the gravity of this offence he"
"should not be dealt with leniently. It is to be noted that he is an unmarried person  without any"
"previous convictions. He has pleaded guilty to the amended charges and he had saved valuable time"
"in court."
"It is a practice that an accused person who pleads guilty to the counts in the indictment should be"
"treated leniently and given him a chance to rectify his mistakes and go back to the society as a good"
"person.  In the present case, the learned trial Judge had imposed 18 years of rigorous imprisonment"
"each for the 2nd and 3rd counts to run concurrently."
"There is no doubt that the accused-appellant is technically guilty of the offence described in section"
"365 b (2) b of the Penal Code. However, after considering the facts and the circumstances of the"
"case and the submission of the counsel I hold that this is not a case where the accused-appellant"
"should be given the maximum custodial sentence."
"We set aside the sentence of 18 years of rigours imprisonment imposed on the accused-appellant"
"in respect of counts 2 and 3. We impose 8 years of rigours imprisonment each for counts 2 and 3."
"The  imprisonment  is  backdated  to  the  date  of  the  judgement  namely  14.12.2020.  The  fine,  the"
"compensation and the default term ordered by the learned trial judge for each count are affirmed."
"The sentence for the 1st count which is 2 years of rigorous imprisonment and the fine will remain"
"the same and the default term ordered by the learned trial Judge for the 1st count is also affirmed."
"We direct the sentences to run concurrently."
"Appeal dismissed. The sentence is differed."
