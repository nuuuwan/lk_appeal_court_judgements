"Green, M. R. delivering the judgment explained the principle as follows;",""
"‘","In the administration of government in this country, the functions which"
"are  given  to  ministers  (and  constitutionally  properly  given  to  ministers,",""
"because they are constitutionally responsible) are functions so multifarious",""
"that no minister could ever personally attend to them. To make the example",""
"of the present case, no doubt there have been thousands of requisitions in",""
"this  country  by  individual  ministries.  It  cannot  be  supposed  that  this",""
"regulation meant that in each case, the minister in person should direct his",""
"mind to the matter. The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers",""
"given  to  ministers  are  normally  exercised  under  the  authority  of  the",""
"ministers  by  responsible  officials  of  the  department.  Public  business",""
"could not be carried on if that were not the case. Constitutionally, the",""
"decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister. The",""
"minister  is  responsible.  It is he  who must  answer  before  Parliament  for",""
"anything  that  his  officials  have  done  under  his  authority,  and,  if  for  an",""
"important  matter  he  selected  an  official  of  such  junior  standing  that  he",""
"could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would",""
"have to answer for that in Parliament. The whole system of departmental",""
"organisation and administration is based on the view that ministers, being",""
"responsible to Parliament, will see that important duties are committed to",""
"experienced officials. If they do not do that, Parliament is the place where",""
"complaint must be made against them"". [Emphasis added].’",""
"T","he ‘Carltona doctrine’ applies where a statute has conferred a power on"
"a Minister and it is practically impossible for the Minister to exercise such",""
"power personally, he may in general act through a duly authorised officer,",""
"without having a formal delegation of power to do so. Here the official is",""
"treated as the Minister’s ‘alter ego’ and the officer’s decision is regarded",""
"as the Minister’s own decision.",""
