"(5) (…)."
"I
t is apparent from Section 208 (4) that the acknowledgement of an appeal"
"under Section 165 (6) is not an act which requires written approval of the"
"CGIR or any Commissioner."
"O
ne  may  argue  that  the  deeming  provision  in  section  208  (2)  does  not"
"permit an Assessor to act on behalf of the Commissioner General."
"I
t is important to note that Section 165(7) itself provides that upon receipt"
"of a valid petition of appeal the CGIR may cause further inquiry to be made"
"by  an  Assessor  or  Assistant  Commissioner,  other  than  the  Assessor  or"
"Assistant Commissioner who made the assessment in appeal. Hence, it is"
"clear  that  the  intention  of  the  Legislature  in  enacting  aforementioned"
"provisions in Section 208 and 217 are not to curtail the authority of the"
"CGIR causing an Assessor to do any act which is to be done under the IR"
"Act."
"The learned Counsel for the Appellant, profusely referring to Sections 165"
"(6), 208 and 217 argued that the combined effect of those Sections is that"
"the CGIR himself should  acknowledge the appeal. It was submitted that"
"the famous doctrine known as Carltona principle, which is a principle of"
"English Constitutional Law is not applicable to the case at hand where there"
"is a statutory power of delegation. The learned Counsel cited the following"
"extract from Lord Woolf, sir Jeffrey Jowell, Catherine Donnelly and Ivan"
"Hare (eds), in De Smith’s Judicial Review70 which reads thus;"
"‘The  Carltona  principle  may  be  expressly  excluded  by  legislation,  but"
"whether it may in addition be excluded by statutory implication remains"
"uncertain.  Two  situations  should  be  distinguished.  Where  a  power  of"
"delegation  is  expressly  conferred  by  Parliament  on  a  minister,  it  may"
"compel the inference that Parliament intended to restrict the devolution of"
"power  to  the  statutory  method,  thus  impliedly  excluding  the  Carltona"
