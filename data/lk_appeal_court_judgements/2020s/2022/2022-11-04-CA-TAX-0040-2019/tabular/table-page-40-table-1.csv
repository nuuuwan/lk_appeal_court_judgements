"personally  would  be  an 
impossible  exercise. 
In  my  view 
that 
the"
"acknowledgment of an appeal is a step within the process of making further"
"inquiries into the appeal submitted by the taxpayer.  Therefore, I am of the"
"view, the Assessor, acknowledging an appeal acting on the directions given"
"by the CGIR under Section 165 (7) of the Inland Revenue Act is valid in"
"law.  The  nature  of  an  acknowledgment  of  an  appeal 
is  merely  an"
"administrative  act.    Therefore,  the  only  reasonable  inference  this  Court"
"could draw is that the Assessor has acknowledged the appeal on the implied"
"delegation of authority by the CGIR."
"Accordingly,  the  argument  of  the  Appellant’s  learned  Counsel  that  the"
"name 
of 
the  CGIR 
should 
have 
been 
printed 
in 
the 
letter 
of"
"acknowledgement pursuant to Section 194 (1) and 194 (5) of the IR Act"
"and whoever acknowledges the appeal, should do  so in the name  of the"
"CGIR also has no merit."
"I
n terms of Section 165 (14) of the Act every appeal has to be determined"
"by the CGIR within a period of two years from the date of its receipt. On"
"the above analysis I hold the appeal has been duly acknowledged by the"
"Assessor’s 
letters  dated  12th  March  2014.  The  CGIR  has  made  his"
"determination on the 1st March 2016, within the stipulated two-year period."
"Accordingly, the question as to whether the appeal is deemed to be allowed"
"will not arise."
"Section 165 (6) provides that if an appeal is acknowledged within thirty"
"days of its receipt, the date of the letter of acknowledgment shall be deemed"
"to be the date of receipt of such appeal. Therefore, the day on which the"
"Appellant received the acknowledgment is immaterial."
"Therefore,  I  hold  that  the  determination  of  the  CGIR  is  not  time  barred"
"under Section 165 (14) of the Inland Revenue Act."
