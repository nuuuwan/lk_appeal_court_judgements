"Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue  (C.A.)38.  The  main  question  for  the"
"decision  of 
the  Supreme  Court  was  whether 
it 
is  mandatory 
to"
"communicate to the taxpayer the reasons for rejecting a return of income"
"tax. The Supreme Court by the majority decision of three judges to two"
"judges,  Wanasundara 
J. 
and  Weeraratne 
J. 
agreeing  with  Neville"
"Samarakoon C.J., made no variation to the decision of the Court of Appeal"
"on the above point."
"In  the  aforementioned  case  of  D.M.S.  Fernando  and  another  v.  A.M."
"Ismail39 all that His Lordship Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon held was"
"that 
the  Assessor  who  rejects  a  return  should  state  his  reasons  and"
"communicate 
them 
to 
the 
tax  payer.  Further, 
the 
reasons  must  be"
"communicated at or about the time the Assessor sends his assessment on"
"an estimated income. Although the Appellant submitted that His Lordship"
"has clearly stated the Notice of Assessment should also be sent at or about"
"the time the reasons for the rejection is sent, His Lordship has not stated as"
"such in the judgment. The requirement of giving a Notice of Assessment"
"had  been 
there  even 
in 
the  Inland  Revenue  Act  No.  4  of  1963,  as"
"amended40, of which relevant provisions were subject to scrutiny by His"
"Lordship Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon in the above-mentioned case."
"However, it is important to note that  His Lordship Chief Justice Neville"
"Samarakoon did not hold that the  ‘reasons must be communicated at or"
"about the time he sends the Notice of Assessment’. All His Lordship held"
"was that ‘reasons must be communicated at or about the time he sends his"
"assessment on an estimated income’. On the other hand, in my humble"
"opinion,  ‘at  or  about  the  time’  is  a  time  limit  with  latitude  where  it  is"
"impossible to draw a precise line."
"I
n  addition,  the  appellant  contended  that  in  the  case  of  Wijewardene  v."
"Kathirgamar  and  another41  as  well  it  was  concluded  that  the  Notice  of"
"Assessment must be sent at or about the time the assessments were made."
"It is important to note, however, that the Court did not conclude as such"
"and all that was held is that the assessment must be sent around the time it"
"was made."
"The  letter  of intimation dated 7th  November  2013  contains  an estimated"
"value  of  services  provided  by  the  Appellant  and  therefore,  the  letter  of"
