"arrive at its determination. The matter in issue in deciding that particular"
"question of law was whether or not the two-year time limit applicable to"
"the  Board  of  Review  was  to  be  counted  from  the  date  of  receipt  of  the"
"Petition of Appeal by the Board, or whether it was to be counted from the"
"date  of  commencement  of  the  hearing  of  the  appeal.  That  matter  was"
"decided in favour of the Respondent, with the Court holding the latter to"
"be the case."
"In  the  above  context,  the  final  two  sentences,  ‘It  would  be  different  or"
"invalid if the time period exceeded 2 years from the date of oral hearing. If"
"that be so it is time barred,’ constitute a conditional observation by Their"
"Lordships. Its nature is hypothetical, and does not reflect the facts of the"
"case,  as  the  time  period  did  not  exceed  two  years  from  the  date  of  oral"
"hearing.  In  other  words,  if  these  two  sentences  were  taken  out  of  the"
"judgement,  there  would  be  no  change  whatsoever  either  to  the  line  of"
"reasoning  in  Mohideen,  or  to  the  outcome.  I  therefore  consider  that  the"
"hypothetical  conclusion  arrived  at  by  Their  Lordships  in  Mohideen  is"
"indeed ‘unnecessary to the decision in the case’. I am of the view that the"
"aforementioned  final  two  sentences  do  not  form  part  of  the  ratio  in"
"Mohideen. Therefore, in keeping with the definition I have provided above,"
"and following the dicta in Stafford Motors, it is my view that the particular"
"statement in Mohideen (as reproduced and emphasised on above) is indeed"
"obiter dictum."
"The doctrine of stare decisis also requires the court to follow the judgment"
"in Stafford Motors and the line of cases it is part of,23 to avoid disturbing"
"the certainty established by such cases."
"Thus, for the reasons enunciated above in this judgement, I would prefer"
"to follow the judgement in the case of Stafford Motors, and I hold that the"
"time limit prescribed in Section 10 of the TAC Act is merely directory."
"In  concluding  my  reasoning  on  the  first  question  of  law,  I  am  indeed"
"mindful of the contention by the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the"
"two-hundred-and-seventy-day timeframe cannot be devoid of meaning. I"
"am  aware  that  a  lack  of  substantial  compliance  with  the  said  timeframe"
"may inconvenience the taxpayer, especially where the timeframe is overrun"
