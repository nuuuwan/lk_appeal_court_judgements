"confirmed 
the  assessments 
issued  for  the 
taxable  quarters  ending  on"
"30.06.2011 (1106), 31.12.2011 (1112) and 31.03.2012 (1203)."
"The Appellant then appealed the CGIR’s determination to the Tax Appeals"
"Commission  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  ‘TAC’).  The  TAC,  by  its"
"determination  dated  31st 
July  2019  determined 
that 
the  assessment"
"No.7123212 for the taxable quarter ending on 30.06 2011 (1106) is time"
"barred and therefore, should be excluded.  The TAC confirmed the other"
"two  assessments  determined  by  the  CGIR.  Accordingly,  the  appeal  was"
"dismissed subject to the aforementioned qualification."
"The aggrieved Appellant moved the TAC to state a case to this Court and"
"the TAC stated a case on the following six questions of law."
"1.  Is the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission time barred?"
"2.  Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law when it concluded that"
"the  Appellant  was 
liable 
to  pay 
the  Nation  Building  Tax  as"
"assessed?"
"3.  Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law when it concluded that"
"the assessment bearing No.7123214 was not time barred?"
