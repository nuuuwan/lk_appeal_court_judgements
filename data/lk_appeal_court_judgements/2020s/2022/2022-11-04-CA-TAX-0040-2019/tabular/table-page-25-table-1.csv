"Consequently, the assessments were  found to be out of time.  The  Court"
"arrived  at  the  above  conclusion  on the footing that the  duty to  assess  is"
"coupled with the duty to serve notice in writing and if not, the Assessor"
"will be  able  to  make  an  assessment  even after the  stipulated  period  and"
"send the Notice of Assessment to the Assessee. Further, if the Assessee"
"takes the position that the assessment was not made within the prescribed"
"time,  the  Assessor  will  be  free  to  produce  a  document  made  after  the"
"prescribed time but, incorrectly bears a date within the prescribed time, as"

"principles of justice."

"Revenue (amendment) law No. 30 of 1978, stated as follows;"
"‘The amending  law  clearly  contemplated  that  the notice  communicating"

"actual assessment of income, wealth or gifts is made for the purpose of"
