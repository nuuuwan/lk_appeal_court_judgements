"I will now refer to N.S. Bindra’s Interpretation of Statutes on this point."
"N. S. Bindra has stated as follows;85"
"‘(…) In a fiscal or a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly"
"said for there is no room for any intendment nor for any equity nor for"
"any presumption. The only criterion is whether or not the words of the"
"Act have reached the alleged subject of taxation. There is no question of"
"equity.’"
"N. S. Bindra citing several Indian judgements states as follows regarding"
"interpretating a taxing statute86;"
"‘The  court  must  look  squarely  at  the  words  of  the  statute  and  interpret"
"them.  It  must  interpret  a  taxing  statute  in  the  light  of  what  is  clearly"
"expressed;  it  cannot  imply  anything  which  is  not  expressed;  it  cannot"
"import provisions in the statute so as to supply any assumed deficiency."
"There  is  no  equity  about  a  tax  and  there  is  no  presumption  as  to  tax."
"Nothing  is  to  be  read  in  and  nothing  is  to  be  implied.  While  equitable"
"considerations  are  of  no  avail  in  the  construction  of  taxing  statutes,  a"
"proper balance must be struck between the essential needs for Revenue of"
"a modern welfare state on the one hand and the desirability that the citizen"
"must know his liability clearly before he can be called upon to contribute"
"to the Revenue on the other.’"
"Regarding exemptions from taxation N. S. Bindra cites from Sutherland,"
"Statutory  Construction,  Vol  3,  Third  Edition,  p.  281;  which  reads  as"
"follows87;"
"‘As a general rule grants of tax exemptions are given a rigid interpretation"
"against the assertion of the tax-payer and in favour of the taxing power."
"The basis for the rule here is the same as that supporting a rule of a strict"
"construction of positive Revenue laws-that the burdens of taxation should"
"be distributed equally and fairly among the members of society. However,"
"exemption  claimed  by  the state  or  its  sub-divisions are  usually  liberally"
"construed  and  the  same  rule  had  frequently  been  applied  to  exemption"
"made in favour of charitable organisation’"
"Further cites Crawford, Statutory Construction, p. 506-08;"
