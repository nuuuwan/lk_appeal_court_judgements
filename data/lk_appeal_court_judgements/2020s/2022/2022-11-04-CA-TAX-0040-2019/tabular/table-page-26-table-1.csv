"assessee in possession of full particulars of the case he is expected to meet,"
"in order that he could assist the Assessor if he does not accept the return"
"to reconsider his rejection if satisfactory reasons are urged by the assessee"
"before the final assessment is made.’"
"Accordingly,  His  Lordship  was  of  the  view  that  the  letter  of  intimation"
"should contain a full particular of the case the tax payer is expected to meet"
"and once the tax payer receives the reasons for not accepting the return, he"
"would  get  an  opportunity  to  convince  the  Assessor  to  reconsider  the"
"rejection by showing satisfactory reasons before the  final assessment is"
"made."
"The  dictum of His Lordship Victor Perera J., supports the view that the"
"letter of intimation should contain an estimate of assessable income along"
"with  an  assessment  of 
income 
tax  payable.  The  final  assessment 
is"
"completed and the Notice of Assessment is issued subsequent to the letter"
"of intimation."
"However, 
in 
the  aforementioned  case  of  ACL  Cables  (C.A.)49  D.N."
"Samarakoon J., observed that the view expressed by Victor Perera J., in"
"His  Lordship’s  judgement  of  A.M.  Ismail  v.  Commissioner  of  Inland"
"Revenue (C.A.)50 that the notice of giving reasons for the rejection of the"
"return  should  precede 
the  Notice  of  Assessment  was  revised  by 
the"
"Supreme Court in appeal, in the judgement of Neville Samarakoon C.J., in"
"D.M.S.  Fernando  and  another  v.  A.M.  Ismail51.  His  Lordship  Neville"
"Samarakoon  C.J.,  stated  that  ‘it  appears  to  me  therefore,  the  duty  to"
"communicate 
reasons 
can  be  discharged  by 
sending 
the 
reasons"
"simultaneously  with 
the  Notice  of  Assessment’.  The  word 
‘appear’"
"connotes the meaning something become visible or noticeable, especially,"
"without apparent cause.  This obviously cannot connote a great degree of"
"certainty in the mind of a Judge. Chinua Asuzu in his work titled ‘Judicial"
"writing,  A  Benchmark 
for 
the  Bench’52stated 
that  a  conclusion 
in  a"
"judgement 
should 
state 
the  disposition  with  maximum  clarity  and"
"maximum  freedom  from  ambiguity.  Accordingly,  it  is  my  humble  view"
"that His Lordship has not arrived at a definite finding on the above matter."
