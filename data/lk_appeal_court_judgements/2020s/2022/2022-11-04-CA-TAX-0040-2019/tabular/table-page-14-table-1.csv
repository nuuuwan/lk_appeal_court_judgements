"The learned Counsel for the Appellant invited the Court to depart from the"
"ruling in Kegalle Plantations PLC v. The Commissioner General of Inland"
"Revenue19 and alleged obiter dicta statement in Stafford Motors20. It was"
"also  argued 
that  even 
though  statement  of  Gooneratne  J.,  regarding"
"applicability of the time bar would not constitute part of the ratio decidendi"
"for  the  decision  it  nevertheless  constitutes  relevant  judicial  dicta  which"
