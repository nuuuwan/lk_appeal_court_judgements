"clearly stated; nothing is to be read in and nothing is to be implied.  One"
"can only look fairly at the language used."
"I agree that where the language is clear, the matter of interpretation would"
"not arise.  If the language of a statutory provision is plain, the Court is not"
"entitled to add any word or to subtract anything from it."
"At argument, the learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that there"
"are no brokers or insurance agents for local produce only. Accordingly, the"
"words, local produce should only apply to commission agents. The learned"
"Counsel for the Respondent submitted that just as there may not be brokers"
"and insurance agents solely for local produce, there may not be auctioneers"
"solely for local produce. I am in favour of the aforementioned argument of"
"the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Respondent.  It  is  true  that  there  will  be  no"
"brokers,  insurance  agents,  auctioneers  or  commission  agents  for  local"
"products  alone.  However, 
it 
is  common  knowledge 
that 
insurance"
"companies  have  different  types  of  insurance  schemes  in  their  insurance"
"activities.  Some  companies  have  coverage  for  crops  that  may  include  a"
"special  coverage  for  local  produce.  Similarly,  an  auctioneer,  broker  or"
"commission agent, among many other services they provide, may also deal"
"with local produce. In such a case, the turnover of the services supplied for"
"any local product would be exempt from the NBT."
"The Appellant's argument is that the words local produce applies only to"
"the  commission  agents 
to  whom 
those  words  are  attached. 
If 
the"
"interpretation  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellant  is  accepted,  the"
"entire turnover of an auctioneer, broker and insurance agent will be exempt"
"from NBT and only the turnover of a commission agent from local produce"
"would be exempted. I see no valid reason for the Legislature to grant such"
"an 
exemption 
for 
the 
specified 
categories,  other 
than 
to  promote"
"transactions  relating 
to 
local  products.  Furthermore,  according 
to  the"
"English text,  a  commission  agent  will  be  entitled  to  the  exemption  and,"
"according  to  the  Sinhalese  text,  an  auctioneer  will  be  entitled  to  the"
"exemption. In my view, such an absurd interpretation would never have"
"been  the  intention of the  Legislature. It is therefore my opinion that the"
"aforementioned argument is unfounded."
