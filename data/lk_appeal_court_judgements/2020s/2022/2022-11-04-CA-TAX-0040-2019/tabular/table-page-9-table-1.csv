"appeal to the TAC. Hence, it becomes clear that while the breach of certain"
"time limits is accompanied by remedies or sanctions, the breach of others"
"is not. It is important to note that, Section 144 of the 2017 Act provides"
"that if the TAC fails either to determine or to respond to an appeal filed by"
"a  person  within  ninety  days  from  the  appeal  request,  the  Appellant  is"
"entitled to appeal to the Court of Appeal."
"From the foregoing analysis, it is clear that in the new Inland Revenue Act"
"No.  24  of  2017,  the  Legislature  has  taken  out  the  penal  consequences"
"previously imposed on the CGIR for failure to comply with the statutory"
"time limit. Nevertheless, upon such failure, the Appellant has been granted"
"a remedy through a direct right of appeal to the TAC, and upon the failure"
"of the TAC to respond to such an appeal request within the specified time"
"limit, the Appellant has been granted a direct right of appeal to the Court"
"of Appeal. Therefore, it can be seen that though the Legislature has in the"
"case of the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017, introduced a remedy where"
"the TAC fails to respond within the specified time limit, in the case of the"
"TAC Act itself, despite twice availing itself of the opportunity to amend"
"the  law,  the  Legislature  has  not  specified  a  remedy  in  case  of  non-"
"compliance."
"I am not unmindful of the fact that this particular question of law is on the"
"TAC Act. Yet, I am of the view that consideration of the above provisions"
"in the Inland Revenue Act are relevant, since those provisions manifest the"
"intention of the Legislature regarding the time limits imposed on the TAC."
"In light of the above, it is my considered view that the Legislature, although"
"has amended Section 10 of the TAC Act twice, intentionally refrained from"
"introducing a penal consequence and/or a remedy for the failure of the TAC"
"to comply with the specified time limit. Therefore, I am not in favour of"
"the argument forwarded by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, that the"
"fact  that  the  Legislature  has  amended  Section  10  twice  means  that  it"
"intended the time limit contained therein to be mandatory."
"Respondent argued that since there is no penalty set out for the failure of"
"the TAC to make a determination within two-hundred-and-seventy days,"
"the time limit specified for the determination to be made by the TAC is"
"merely directory10."
