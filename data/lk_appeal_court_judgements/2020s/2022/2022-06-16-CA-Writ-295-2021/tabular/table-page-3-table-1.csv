"are annexed to the Petition, marked as, ‘P2’, ‘P3’, and ‘P4’ respectively. The instructions"
"related to such admission of children for the year 2021 issued by the Ministry of Education"
"are marked as ‘P5’."
"The  Petitioners’  initial  claim  is  that  the  2nd  Petitioner  was  not  granted  2  marks  at  the"
"interview in respect of the Deed of Lease No. 726 which had been submitted to establish"
"their residence. The Petitioners allege that although they have been residing at the address"
"mentioned in the above caption since January 2015, the formal Deed of Lease No. 726"
"was entered into on 09.09.2015. The Petitioners urge that the members of the interview"
"panel  disregarded  the  validity  of  the  said  Deed  of  Lease  No.  726  from  01.01.2015  to"
"31.12.2015.  A  reasonable  question  arises  as  to  whether  an  applicant  who  applies  for"
"admission to Grade 1 is privileged to submit a Lease agreement with retrospective effect"
"to  justify  the  residence  in  view  of  the  said  Circulars.  The  scheme  of  the  provisions  in"
"relation to the close residence category under the said Circulars, in my view, is that it is"
"mandatory for such applicant to actually live at the premises at the address provided in the"
"application during the required period of time. However, the Petitioners have not made"
"submissions on the above question at the hearing stage although several averments to that"
"effect contained in the Petition of the Petitioners."
"The primary argument raised by the Petitioners at the hearing is based on clauses 6.0(e),"
"6.1 (III) of the aforesaid Instructions related to admission of children to Grade 1 for the"
"year  2021  marked  ‘P5’  and  those  provisions  are  similar  to  clause  7.1.5  of  the  Circular"
"marked ‘P2’. It is noted that the said ‘P5’ is based on the above Circulars ‘P2’ and ‘P4’."
"The said clause 7.1.5 of the Circular marked ‘P2’ has been amended by the Circular No."
"29/2019 (i) marked ‘P3’."
"The  Petitioners  applied  for  admission  under  the  close  proximity  category  of  the  said"
"Circular ‘P2’. The Clause 6.1 (III) of ‘P5’ (7.2.4 of ‘P2’) deals with the proximity to the"
"school from the residence. In terms of the said Clause, maximum marks shall be awarded"
"only if the applicants place of residence is proved and if there are no other Government"
"Schools  with  primary  sections  located  closer  to  the  place  of  residence  than  the  School"
"applied for. Further, it stipulates that in the event of having other Government Schools"
"with  Primary  Sections  for  the  admission  of  the  child  which  are  closer  to  the  place  of"
"residence than the School applied for, marks will be deducted at the rate of 5 marks from"
"the maximum marks for each such closer School."
