"of  the  PW-1’s  house,  the  appellant  came  closer  to  him  in  front  and"
"threatened  “not  to  move”  and  shot  at  him.  When  PW-2  was  cross-"
"examined about the way of identifying the appellant, he stated that he"
"saw the appellant's face in the moonlight. (Page 105 of the appeal brief)."
"Even PW-3 has testified that he heard the appellant came in front of"
"PW-1’s  house  and  threatened  everybody  to  come  out.  PW-1  has  also"
"stated that   PW-2, the brother of the deceased was shot in front of his"
"house  around  7.00  –  7.30  p.m.  (Page  164  of  the  appeal  brief).  In"
"addition, PW-5 has stated that he heard a gunshot and then saw PW-2"
"falling  on  the  ground  near  the  stile  (කඩුල්ල).  Although  there  was  no"
"medical evidence, it is apparent that the PW-2 was shot and injured."
"Since the appellant came in front of PW-2 and shot at him, there is no"
"question about his identity, especially since they knew each other very"
"well.  Hence, the attempted murder charge has been proved beyond a"
"reasonable doubt."
