"to come to the only inference of the guilt of the appellant for the offence"
"of murder as well."
"T
he 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for  the  appellant  also  raised  an"
"argument that according to PW-2, when he was shot at the yard of PW-"
"1,  his  brother,  the  deceased  was  also  there.  Therefore,  the  learned"
"President’s Counsel argued, if the appellant wanted to kill the deceased,"
"he  could  have  shot  him  at  that  time.  Therefore,  he  argued  that"
"subsequent shooting while hiding in a culvert is improbable."
"P
W-2 has clearly stated that the appellant came there, threatened them,"
"pointed out the gun, and fired. PW-2 stated that he was injured due to"
"the  said  gunshot.  His  further  evidence  provides  the  answer  to  the"
"argument  raised  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel.  When  PW-2  fell"
"down  due  to  the  gunshot  injury,  his  brother  (the  deceased)  rushed"
"towards his house to bring water lamenting that his brother was shot"
"(page 93 of the appeal brief). Therefore, there was no opportunity to shot"
"at  the  deceased  at  that  time.  Thereafter,  somehow  PW-2  managed  to"
"come to his house with his injuries. Then, he was taken to the hospital."
"According to PW-5, he had seen PW-2 fell on the ground and thereafter"
"he went towards the road to see PW-2’s brother, Fauz (sometimes called"
"as  “Fauci”).  Then  he  saw  the  appellant  firing  at  the  deceased  as  the"
"deceased was coming from PW-1’s house. Therefore, it is apparent that"
"the appellant could not shoot at the deceased in the very short time that"
"he  was  with  PW-2.  After  shooting  PW-2,  the  appellant  shot  at  the"
"deceased also,  hiding  in  the culvert.  Hence, there is no  improbability"
"whatsoever in the prosecution story. Also, for the reasons stated above,"
"the  accused-appellant’s 
identity  has  been 
established  beyond  a"
"reasonable  doubt.  Thus,  I  regret  that  I  am  unable  to  agree  with  the"
"contentions  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  in  relation  to  the  first"
"ground of appeal, that the identity of the appellant was not satisfactory."
