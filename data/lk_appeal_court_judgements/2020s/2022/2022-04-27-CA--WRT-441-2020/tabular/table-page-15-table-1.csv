"As  I  have  already  held,  the  necessity  and  suitability  of  the  Petitioner’s  land  for  the"
"establishment  of  a  post  office  has  been  decided  at  an 
inquiry  held  with 
the"
"participation of the Petitioner in terms of Section 4 as far back as 2004. The written"
"declaration made by the Minister under Section 5(1) in 2007 is conclusive proof that"
"the said land is needed for the post office. The argument of the Petitioner that ‘P6’"
"having  been 
issued  four  years  after  the  said  written  declaration  of  the  Minister"
"demonstrates  that  the  land  is  no  longer  required  for  the  aforementioned  public"
"purpose is rebutted by the fact that the Minister of Lands has made a further written"
"declaration 
in  2018  under  Section  5(1),  marked 
‘P8’.  This  declaration  has  been"
"published  in  the  Gazette.  What  prevails  now  is  this  declaration,  thereby  bringing"
"finality as provided by Section 5(2) of the Act."
