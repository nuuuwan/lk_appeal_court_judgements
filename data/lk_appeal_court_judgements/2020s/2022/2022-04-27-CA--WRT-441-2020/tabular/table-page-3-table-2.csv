"A
ll three directives have been complied with by the parties."
"T
he learned State Counsel raised two objections with regard to the maintainability of"
"this application. The first is that the Petitioner does not have the locus standi to have"
"and maintain this application. The second is that the letters sought to be quashed do"
"not  contain  a  decision,  and  that  the  5th  Respondent  was  merely  implementing  the"
"provisions of the Act in respect of a land the title of which had vested in the State as"
"far  back  as  2007.  I  shall  consider  these  two  objections  after  having  considered  the"
"arguments of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner."
