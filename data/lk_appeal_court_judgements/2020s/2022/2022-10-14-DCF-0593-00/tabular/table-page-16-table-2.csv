"“It   was   not   disputed,   in   this   case   on   either   side,   that   a   privileged"
"occasion   is,   in   reference   to   qualified   privilege   an   occasion   where   the"
"person   who   makes   a   communication   has   an   interest   or   a   duty,   legal,"
"social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made and the"
"person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to"
"receive it. This reciprocity is essential”."
