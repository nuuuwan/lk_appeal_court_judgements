"It is pertinent to note that his lordship the Chief Justice also said,"
"“In dealing with the Roman-Dutch law of defamation it is advisable as suggested by"
"De Villiers (48 S. A. L. J. 467) to avoid such expressions as “malice”, “express malice”,"
"“legal malice “implied malice”, and “actual malice”. The expression “malice” in English"
"law has given rise to a great deal of misunderstanding and some of the English jurists,"
"notably   Pollock,   have   adopted   the   formula   of  absence  of  “good  faith”,  which  is   the"
"expression used in section 479 of our Penal Code. In Roman-Dutch law for defamation"
"to be actionable it  is  not necessary  that  it should have  entailed special damage  or"
"actual pecuniary loss to the person defamed {Fradd v. Jacquelin),5. It is sufficient that"
"his feelings have been  injured and that  the writer intends to  do  so. (Boyd Moss v."
"Ferguson) 6.”"
"Having said so, if animus injuriandi must be present in Roman Dutch Law to"
"constitute   defamation,   cannot   it   be   said,   that,   the   absence   of   animus"
"injuriandi, simplicitur a valid defence, without seeking refuge in the accepted"
"defences in English Law?"
"M. G. Perera vs. A. V. Peiris, 1948,  was a decision of the Privy Council. Dr."
"Perera’s   action   on   defamation   in   respect   of   a   news   item   published   in   the"
"newspaper called, The Ceylon Daily News, was dismissed in the District Court."
"The Supreme Court of Ceylon affirmed that dismissal."
"D.   N.   Pritt,   K.C.,   for   the   respondent   (“The   Ceylon   Daily   News”)   in   his"
"submissions, raised the question with regard to absence of animus injuria. He"
"said,"
"“In the Roman Dutch Law of defamation the existence of the animus injuriandi is an"
"essential pre-requisite of liability…It was therefore open in the Roman Dutch Law to a"
"defendant to negative liability by proving the absence of animus injuriandi on his part."
"Voet in De Injuriis (47.10.20) states “ Next with regard to the person who is alleged to"
"have   occasioned   an   injury   the   fact   that   he   had   entertained   no   intention   to   injure"
"(animus  injuriandi)  is  a  good  ground  for   his   not   being  held  liable   in  an   action   for"
"injury.   The   fact   that   such   intention   was   absent   is   to   be   gathered   from   the"
