"similarly, an actual intention or desire to injure is not, under the Roman-Dutch law,"
"necessary   to   constitute  animus  injuriandi.  Reckless  or   careless   statements   may   be"
"taken as proof of animus injuriandi; and while, in English law, malice can only be"
"refuted by showing that the occasion was privileged, or that the words were no more"
"than honest and fair expressions of opinion on matters of public interest and general"
"concern, the Roman-Dutch law allows proof, not only of such a circumstance as that"
"the   occasion   was   privileged,   but   of   any   other   circumstance   that   furnished   a"
"reasonable excuse for the use of the words complained of”."
"Pereira   J.,   said,   “…the   Roman-Dutch   law   allows   proof,   not   only   of   such   a"
"circumstance as that the occasion was privileged, but of any other circumstances that"
"furnish a reasonable excuse for the use of the words complained of”."
"In  CANTLAY v. VANDEESPAAB, (1914) it was said, “Under the Roman-Dutch law,"
"injury to one's feelings, honour, dignity, or reputation is not actionable, unless the"
"offender acted animo injuriandi. Joke or jest, if legitimate and seasonable, is sufficient"
"to exclude the idea of an intention to injure, but when language has been used which,"
"regarded by itself and in connection with surrounding circumstances, constitutes ex"
"facie an injury, the allegation that the words were used merely as a joke of a legitimate"
"nature must be made good by the defendant by sufficiently convincing evidence”."
"The judgment of Pereira J., said, “The words occur in a postscript to a letter written by"
"the   defendant   addressed   to   the   firm   of   Messrs.   Julius   &   Creasy,   and   they   are   as"
"follows: ""Is there any truth in the report that Mr. Creasy has turned Muhammadan"
"and married Mrs. Cantlay? We would like to send them both a present."""
"His   lordship   also   said,   “The   burden   was   on   the   plaintiff   to   show   that   the   words"
"referred to above were by themselves defamatory of the plaintiff. This she has done by"
"proving the following facts. That Mr. Creasy referred to in the words is Mr. Creasy, a"
"member of the firm of Messrs. Julius & Creasy, who had at one time acted as the"
"plaintiff's   proctor   in   a   legal   proceeding;   that   Mr.   Creasy   is   an   elderly   gentleman,"
"married,   and   having   children;   that   Mrs.   Cantlay   referred   to   in   the   words   is   the"
"plaintiff,   and   that   she   is   a   widow   of   the   age   of   54   years;   with   several   grown-up"
"children. Looked at  in the light of these facts, there is no question  that the words"
"referred to are defamatory of both the plaintiff and Mr. Creasy”."
