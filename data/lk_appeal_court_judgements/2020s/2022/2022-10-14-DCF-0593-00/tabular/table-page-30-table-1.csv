"is a question of law. It was having referred to the quotation from Willes J., Lord"
"Atkinson said his oft quoted passage which is,"
"“It   was   not   disputed,   in   this   case   on   either   side,   that   a   privileged"
"occasion   is,   in   reference   to   qualified   privilege,   an   occasion   where   the"
"person   who   makes   a   communication   has   an   interest   or   a   duty,   legal,"
"social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the"
"person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to"
"receive it. This reciprocity is essential”."
