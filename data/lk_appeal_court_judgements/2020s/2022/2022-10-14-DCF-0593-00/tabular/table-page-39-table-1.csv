"As   per   the   aforementioned   discussion,   there   is   no   “animus   injuriandi”   or"
"“malice” that could be inferred from the relevant newspaper articles, although"
"such   terms   as   “…hamuda   Colonel   dotta”,   were   used.   The   aforementioned"
"authorities show that the law permits such factual inaccuracies. Furthermore,"
"it cannot be said that it is “inaccurate” too, because the plaintiff was (although"
"it was a transfer) was actually removed from the position he held. His protest"
"by P.08 shows that even he considered it, as something similar to what"
"those newspaper articles said. It was said in Reynolds 02 by Lord Hobhouse,"
"“…Truth is not in practice an absolute criterion..”"
"It is pertinent to note, what the author  Rolf Dobelli  says in his book “Stop"
"Reading the News”. [2020] He was, on 12th April 2013 invited by the Guardian"
"to talk about his book, “The Art of Thinking Clearly”. But, abruptly, the Editor"
"in Chief Alan Rusbridger, asked him to talk about Dobelli’s new article on his"
"website. Dobelli says, “The article Rusbridger had found on my website listed"
"the   most   important   arguments   against   consuming   precisely   what   these"
"internationally respected professionals spent their days producing: the news."
"Dobelli had to discard, his prepared speech and speak off the cuff, so to speak."
"He says, “Now, instead of standing in front of fifty people well disposed to me, I"
"was  confronted   by   fifty   opponents.   Caught   in  the   crossfire   of   their   stares,   I"
"tried to stay as calm as possible. After twenty minutes I’d reached the end of"
"my   argument,   concluding   with   the   words,   “Let’s   be   honest:   what   you’re"
"doing here, ladies and gentlemen, is basically entertainment”."
"“Silence.   You   could   have   heard   a   pin   drop.   Rusbridger   narrowed   his   eyes,"
"glanced   around   and   said,   “I”d   like   us   to   publish   Mr.   Dobelli’s   arguments."
"Today”."
