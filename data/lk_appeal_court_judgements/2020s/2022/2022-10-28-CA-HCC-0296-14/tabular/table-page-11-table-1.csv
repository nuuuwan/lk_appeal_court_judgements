"His evidence in this regard has been led in Magistrate Court Kandy Case No. NS"
"63496 on 4th September 2000. It appears that although the application of the"
"prosecution has been allowed, his deposition at the non-summary had not been"
"produced and marked as part of the evidence at the trial before the High Court."
"The rest of the witnesses who have testified in this trial are the official witnesses"
"and the investigation officers."
"By his judgement dated 4th July 2014, it becomes clear that the learned High"
"Court Judge has convicted the appellant and the 2nd accused indicted, based on"
"the eyewitness account as well as the dying depositions of the deceased."
"With  the  above  factual  positions  in  mind,  I  will  now  proceed  to  consider  the"
"grounds of appeal urged and the submissions made by the learned Presidentâ€™s"
"Counsel as well as the learned Deputy Solicitor General in that regard."
