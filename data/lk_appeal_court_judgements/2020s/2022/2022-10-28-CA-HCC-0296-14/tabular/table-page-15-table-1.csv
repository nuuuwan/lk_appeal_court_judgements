"he  was  living  in  his  home  district  of  Vanni  until  the  Sri  Lankan  government"
"gained  control  of  the  area  and  subsequently  left  Sri  Lanka  to  pursue  higher"
"studies in the year 2001. He has stated further that he only came to know that"
"he  was  convicted  for  murder  by  reading  the  online  edition  of  the  Daily  Mirror"
"newspaper on 4th July 2014, which was the date of the judgement."
"The Magistrate Court of Kandy non-summary case No- 63496 indicates that the"
"appellant was named as a suspect in the case from the initial B report number"
"B44950/97  filed  by  the  officer-in-charge  of  the  Peradeniya  police.  However,"
"police were never able to arrest the appellant after the death of Warapragash as"
"he had fled the area after the incident."
"The indictment in this matter has been filed before the High Court of Kandy on"
"21st July 2004. As for the reasons considered before, it is abundantly clear that"
"even  if  the  police  were  aware  of  the  address  the  learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel"

"he has already left the country by then."
"It  appears  from  the  High  Court  case  record  that  after  the  case  against  the"
"appellant commenced, the succeeding High Court Judge on 30th November 2009"
"has ordered the police to conduct further investigations about the whereabouts"
"of the appellant and report to the Court. This appears to be a genuine attempt"
"by the learned High Court Judge to get the appellant before the Court,  which"
"cannot be termed as proof that the appellant has not been properly served with"
"summons."
"It is my considered view that the decision of the learned High Court Judge who"
"considered the evidence made available and ordered that the trial shall proceed"
"in the absence of the appellant was a decision made after satisfying about that"
"fact. Therefore, I find no basis for the considered grounds of appeal."
"Besides that, if the appellant is claiming that he was not served with summons"
"not  due  to  any  fault  of  his,  the  course  of  action  he  can  adhere  to  has  been"
"provided in section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act in itself."
