"I am of the view that any person against whom a High Court trial has proceeded"
"in his absence after taking due procedural steps in terms of section 241 (1) of"
"the Code of Criminal Procedure Act needs to first make an application in terms"
"of section 241 (3) before the same Court and satisfy Court that his absence from"
"the whole or part of the trial was bona fide."
"I am of the view that it is only thereafter an accused can seek to challenge the"
"order of refusal to act in terms of section 241(3) before the Court of Appeal."
"In the appeal under consideration, although it seems that the appellant has had"
"legal representations at least from the date of the judgement, the appellant has"
"never chosen to take that necessary procedural step."
"The appellant has chosen to file an appeal challenging the judgement, which is"
"a step he has chosen rather than appearing before the trial Court. Hence, I am"
"of the view that, it is not open for the appellant to now argue that he was  not"
"served with summons and was denied a fair trial."
"The 3rd, 4th and the 5th Grounds of Appeal: -"
"The  above  three  grounds  of  appeal  will  be  considered  together  as  they  are"
"interrelated."
"The mentioned three grounds of appeal are grounds urged on the basis that there"
"was no evidence to establish that the statement made by the deceased to police"
"was accurately translated and that the learned High Court Judge considered the"
"evidence contrary to the relevant provision of the Evidence Ordinance and also"
"that the learned High Court Judge was wrong in the way he considered evidence"
"in terms of section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"The evidence led in this action clearly establishes the fact that PW-11 (PS 903)"
"Dissanayake  Mudiyanselage  Piyasena  who  was  attached  to  the  Slave  Island"
"police has recorded a statement from the deceased Warapragash while he was"
"receiving  treatment  at  Nawaloka  hospital  on  17th  October  1997  where  the"
"deceased has revealed as to what happened to him and who was responsible."
