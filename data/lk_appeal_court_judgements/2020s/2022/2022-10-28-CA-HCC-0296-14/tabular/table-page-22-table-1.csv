"(1) Death of the declarant before the proceedings."
"(2) The  statement  must  relate  to  the  cause  of  his  death  or  any  of  the"
"circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death."
"(3) The case must be such that the cause  of the declarant’s death must"
"come into question."
"(4) The competency of the declarant to testify may have to be established,"
"depending  upon  circumstances  of  each  case,  but  strict  rules  of"
"competency do not apply."
"(5) The statement must be a complete verbal statement, though it may take"
"the  form  of  question  and  answer  or  appropriate  gestures.  It  must  be"
"complete in itself and capable of definite meaning."
"At  page  469,  citing  several  decided  cases,  Coomaraswamy  discusses  the"
"probative  value  of  evidence, 
infirmities  of  such  evidence, 
the  necessary"
"directions, in the following manner;"
"‘The  probative  value  of  dying  declarations  relevant  under  section  32(1)"
"would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But there is"
"no doubt that such evidence suffers from certain intrinsic infirmities. Two"
"of these defects are the fact that the statement was not made under oath"
"and the absence of cross-examination of the deponent of the statement.’"
"The 
following  matters  require  consideration 
in  regard  to  the  proper"
"directions:"
"(1) The  deceased  not  been  before  the  court  as  a  witness,  and  not"
"having made the statement under oath, this is an infirmity in the"
"evidence of the statement."
"(2) The statement has not been tested by cross-examination."
"(3) The weight that should be attributed to the statement admitted"
"in the circumstances of a given case."
