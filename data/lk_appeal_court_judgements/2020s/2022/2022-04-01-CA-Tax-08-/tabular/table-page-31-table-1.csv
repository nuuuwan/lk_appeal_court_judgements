"for 
local  consumption,  which  does  not  signify  an  “export”  within  the"
"meaning of Section 7 (1 (a) of the VAT Act."
"Destination Principle"
"[93] VAT is generally applied on a transaction-by-transaction basis and the"
"supply of goods is in principle subject to VAT in the jurisdiction where the"
"goods  are 
located  at  the  time  of  the  transaction  and,  and  when  a"
"transaction 
involves  goods  being  moved 
from  one 
jurisdiction  to"
"another, 
the  destination  principle 
applies.  Under 
the  destination"
"principle,  exports  are  not  subject  to  VAT,  and  suppliers  are  allowed  a"
"refund of input VAT. The exported goods are free of VAT in the supplier’s"
"jurisdiction as  specified in Section 7 (1)  (a) of the VAT Act.  If  the present"
"transaction  of 
the  Appellant 
involves  goods  being  moved 
from  one"
"jurisdiction  to  another,  the  destination  principle  applies  and  under  the"
"destination principle, the element of export is satisfied when the foreign"
"destination  point  is  intended  and  indicated  in  the  relevant  documents"
"submitted by the Appellant."
