"time for our client to explain the basis adopted to pay value added tax,"
"which action by the Assessor undermines the whole basis if Section 29"
"of the Act”."
"[112] A perusal of the said letter reveals that the Appellant has not denied"
"the receipt  of  the Assessor’s letter  dated  15.08.2007 but  the complaint of"
"the Appellant was that assessments have been made without giving reasons"
"and thus, it was not an intimation under Section 29 of the VAT Act. A perusal"
"of the letter dated dated 01.09.2003 (A4 (e) of the Appellant further reveals"
"that the Appellant’s complaint was that the reasons given for rejecting the"
"returns did not comply with the mandatory provisions of section 29 of the"
"VAT Act."
"[113] In the present case, the Assessor by letter dated 15.07.2003 rejected"
"the  returns  submitted  by  the  Appellant  and  provided  reasons  for  not"
"accepting the returns (A2). A perusal of the said letter clearly reveals that the"
"Assessor  had  given  reasons  for  rejecting  the  returns  submitted  by  the"
"Appellant and held that for the said reasons, the supply of the bunker fuel"
"cannot  constitute  an  export  (Vide-  paragraph    3  of  the  judgment  for  the"
"reasons given by the Assessor)."
"[114]  The  Appellant  has  claimed  the  input  credit  on  the  basis  that  the"
"Appellant is entitled to zero rated status, but the Assessor for the reasons,"
"given  in  his  communication  dated  15.07.2003  has  clearly  stated  that  the"
"supply  of  bunker  fuel  cannot  constitute  an  export  and  therefore,  the"
"Appellant is not entitled to the zero rated status under Section 7 (1) (a) of"
"the VAT Act. The Assessor has further that for those reasons, the refund in"
"excess of the amount due, cannot be claimed."
"[115] In the result, I hold that the Assessor has communicated his reasons"
"for the rejection of the relevant assessments as  required by Section 29 of"
"the  VAT  Act  and  therefore,  the  question  of  law  No.  1  is  answered  in  the"
"favour of the Respondent."
