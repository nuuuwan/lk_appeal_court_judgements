"fact that the sale of bunker fuel was paid for in foreign currency does not"
"necessarily render it an export within the meaning of Section 7 (1) (a) of the"
"VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002."
"Licence under the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act, No. 28 of 1961"
"[65]  The  Appellant  argues  that  the  Appellant  possesses  a  licence  under"
"Section  5B  of  the  Ceylon  Petroleum  Corporation  Act,  No.  28  of  1961  to"
"import,  export,  sell,  supply  or  distribute  marine  gas,  oil  and  furnace  oil"
"(Vide- paragraph 43 of the written submissions tendered on behalf of the"
"Appellant    on  18.10.2019).  In  my  view,  the  licence  granted  by  the  Ceylon"
"Petroleum  Corporation  under  Section  5B  of 
the  Ceylon  Petroleum"
"Corporation Act, No. 28 of 1961 does not necessarily mean that the supply"
"of bunker fuel shall be treated as an export within the meaning of Section"
"7 (1) (a) of the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002."
"Central Bank Annual Reports"
"[66] The Appellant relies heavily on the Annual Reports of the Central Bank"
"for  the  year  2011  in  table  3.4  on  page  63,  which,  the  Appellant  claims"
"distinguishes between exports and local sales and table 3.4 which lists the"
"Appellant  as  a  source  for  both  imports  and  export  data.  The  Appellant"
"submits that the Report supports his contention that the supply of bunker"
"fuel has been recognised as an export by the Central Bank. In my view, the"
"table 3.4 does not support the contention that the it distinguishes between"
"exports  and 
local  sales  or  that  the  Central  Bank  has  recognised  the"
"Appellant as an exporter within the meaning of any statute as claimed by"
"the Appellant."
"[67] The document (R1) issued by the Central Bank stated that for statistical"
"compilation and economic analysis, bunker fuel and marine fuel selling to"
"foreign  ships  and  aircraft  is  an  export  following  internationally  accepted"
"practices  for  economic  data  compilation. 
It,  however,  states  that  this"
"classification is not used for any other purpose as the classification is not"
"made in terms of any law or for the purpose of any law. Accordingly, this"
"document does not help the Appellant."
"[68]  The  Appellant  relies  on  the  New  Zeeland  Court  of  Appeal  case  in"
"Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue  v.  International  Importing  Limited  (1972)"
"NZLR 1095 in support its position that the word “export” is complete when"
