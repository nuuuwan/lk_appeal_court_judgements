"substitute   his   heirs   who   were,   therefore,   not   bound   by   all   the"

"sitting in judgment either on the interlocutory decree or on the decree in"
"appeal passed by this Court.  We are merely declaring that, so far as"
"the   petitioner-is   concerned,   there   has   been   a   violation   of   the"
"principles   of   natural   justice   which   makes   it   incumbent   on   this"
