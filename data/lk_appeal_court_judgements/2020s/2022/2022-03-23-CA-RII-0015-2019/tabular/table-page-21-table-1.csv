"“In the eighteenth- century Blackstone 378 expressed the principle in a way"
"somewhat more fitting to modern ears: ‘Thus if an Act of Parliament gives a"
"man power to try all causes that arise within his manor of Dale; yet if a cause"
"should arise in which he is himself a party, the Act is construed not to extend"
"to that, because it is unreasonable that any man should determine his own"
"quarrel’.”"
"32. Having so examined of the impartiality of Judges, if one takes a look at the"
"written   submissions   of   the   plaintiff   respondent,   dated   08th  April   2021,   it   is"
"filled with advice to the 01st  defendant petitioner; the former part as to what"
"other remedies at law were available to the petitioner and the latter part as to"
"how the 33,000 volt wire should be laid, whether it should be by a “zig-zag”"
"method   or   by   underground   cables.   But   it   must   be   hastily   added   that   the"
"aforesaid statement is not in complete jest, for the said latter part should be"
"taken   serious   note   of,   when   it   comes   to   the   safety   of   the   plaintiff   and   her"
"family, of which more will be said later."
"33.   When   the   plaintiff   argues   that   the   petitioner   could   have   made   an"
"application to the district court itself for the vacation of the enjoining order or"
"leave to appeal applications in respect of other orders to the Provincial High"
"Court that exercise civil appellate jurisdiction, one must not forget the fact that"
"initially the present  application was coupled  with a transfer  application, No."
"08/2019/TRF, on the basis of the alleged bias of the learned District Judge."
"Hence this court does not agree with the plaintiff when she alleges that the"
"petitioner joined three orders in restitutio in integrum to circumvent its delay"
"in   making   applications   to   vacate   the   enjoining   order   or   leave   to   appeal"
"applications.   Therefore  this  court  decides   that  the  cases  such  as  Sri   Lanka"
"Insurance Corporation Ltd., vs. Shanmugam and another (1995) 1 SLR 55"
"and Don Lewis vs. Dissanayake 70 NLR 8 are not applicable."
