"n  the  case  of  Bandulasena  and  Others  Vs.  Galla  Kankanamge  Chaminda  Kushantha  and"
"Others [CA PHC No. 147/2005 - CA Minutes 27.09.2017] which emphasized that;"
"“It would be  relevant  to  bear in  mind that the  appeal  before this Court is  an  appeal"
"against  a  Judgement  pronounced  by  the  Provincial  High  Court  in  exercising  its"
"revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, the task before Court is not to consider an appeal against"
"the original Court Order, but to consider an appeal in which an Order pronounced by"
"the Provincial High Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction is sought to be"
"impugned”."
