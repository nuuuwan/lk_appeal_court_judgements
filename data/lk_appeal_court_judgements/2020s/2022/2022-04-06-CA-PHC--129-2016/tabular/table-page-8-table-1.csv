"In terms of Section 5D (1) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 54 of"
"2006 as amended,"
"“Where any appeal or application in respect of which the jurisdiction is granted to a High"
"Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution and by Section 5A of this Act is filed"
"in the Court of Appeal, such appeal or application, as the case may be, may be transferred"
"for a hearing and determination to an appropriate High Court…….”"
"T
he said High Court shall hear and determine such appeal or application as the case may be, as if"
"such appeal or application was directly made to such High Court."
"T
herefore, in view of the aforesaid reasons, it is apparent that the learned High Court Judge has"
"erroneously dismissed the said revision application of the Applicant-Petitioner-Appellant by Order"
"dated  11.03.2015  which  was  made  per  incuriam.  Hence,  we  set  aside  the  Order  made  by  the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  dated  11.03.2015  and  I  hold  that  the  impugned  revision  application"
"bearing  No.  HCR/RA/48/2011  should  be  taken  up  before  the  present  High  Court  Judge  of  the"
"Provincial High Court of Ratnapura to re-hear and determine the matter on its merit."
"H
ence,  the  appeal  is  allowed  and  the  Registrar  is  directed  to  send  the  case  record  back  to  the"
"Provincial High Court of Ratnapura forthwith."
