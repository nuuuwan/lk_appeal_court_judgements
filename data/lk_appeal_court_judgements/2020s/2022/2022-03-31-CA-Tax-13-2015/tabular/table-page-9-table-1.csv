"[20] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act stipulates that the Tax"
"Appeals Commission  shall make its  determination within 270  days  from"
"the date of the commencement of its sittings for the hearing of the appeal."
"Superficially, the effects of non-compliance of a provision are dealt with in"
"terms  of  the  mandatory-directory  classification.  Generally,  in  case  of  a"
"mandatory provision, the act done in breach thereof is void, whereas, in"
"case of a directory provision, the act does not become void, although some"
"other  consequences  may  follow  (P.M.  Bakshi,  Interpretation  of  Statutes,"
"First Ed, 2008422)."
"[21] The argument advanced by Dr. Shivaji Felix in the written submissions"
"filed on behalf of the Appellant was that the word ""shall” used in Section"
"10  is  normally  to  be  interpreted  as  connoting  a  mandatory  provision,"
"meaning that what is thereby enjoined is not merely desired (directory) to"
"be done but must be done (mandatory). Thus, he has submitted that the"
"effect  of 
such  breach  of  a  mandatory  provision,  which  has 
the"
"consequence  of 
the  determination  of 
the  Tax  Appeals  Commission"
"rendering invalid. But, the use of the word “shall” does not always mean"
"that  the  provision  is  obligatory  or  mandatory  as  it  depends  upon  the"
"context in which the word “shall” occurs, and the other circumstances as"
"echoed by the Indian Supreme Court case of The Collector of Monghyr v."
"Keshan Prasad Goenka, AIR 1962 SC 1694 at p. 1701) in the following words:"
"“It is needless to add that the employment of the auxiliary verb "" shall"" is"
"inconclusive  and  similarly  the  mere  absence  of  the 
imperative 
is  not"
"conclusive either. The question whether any requirement is mandatory or"
"directory has to be decided, not merely on the basis of any specific provision"
"which, for instance, sets out the consequence of the omission to observe the"
"requirement,  but  on  the  purpose  for  which  the  requirement  has  been"
"enacted,  particularly  in  the  context  of  the  (1)  [1958]  S.C.R.  533,  other"
"provisions of the Act and the general scheme thereof. It would, inter alia,"
"depend on whether the requirement is insisted on as a protection for the"
"safeguarding  of  the  right  of  liberty  of  a  person  or  of  property  which  the"
"action might involve”."
"[22]  Thus,  an  enactment  in  form  is  mandatory  might,  in  substance  be"
"directory and that the use of the word “shall” does not conclude the matter"
"(Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Ahmad Ishaque AIR 1955 SC 233). It is not in dispute"
"that Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act does not say what will"
