"[97] It is significant to note that A.G. v. Pougett (supra) was not an income",""
"tax or a custom case, but a decision under the Tyne Coals Act which has",""
"now been abolished. There was clear evidence in that case that the coals",""
"had been taken away for the purpose of being wholly consumed beyond",""
"the limits of the port and thus, the coals were held to be exported",""
"[98] In Stockton Ry v. Barrett, 8 E.R. 1225 (House of Lords), the action was for",""
"money had and received, originally brought in the Court of Common Pleas,",""
"to recover three sums of money, which the plaintiff there, Charles Barrett,",""
"alleged  had  been  unlawfully  received  by  the  defendants  as  tolls  on  the",""

"empowered the proprietors to levy on all coals carried along any part of",""
