"constitute an export and therefore, the it cannot be treated as zero rated"
"supply”."
"[165]  The  argument  of  the  Appellant  was  that  Section  22  (8)  cannot  be"
"engaged when the excess input credit claim is collateral to the basis of the"
"assessment which in the present case is predicated on the classification of"
"the supply. The underlined principle is that the meaning and intention of"
"the statute must be collected from the plain and unambiguous expression"
"used therein rather than from any notions which may be entertained by"
"the court as to what is meant by the provision. A perusal of Section 22 (8)"
"of  the  VAT  Act  reveals  that  the  power  of  the  Assessor  to  extend  the"
"completion of the assessment beyond the period specified in Section 33 is"
"a special power “notwithstanding the provision of Section 33”."
"[166] Section 22 (8) provides that the time bar for making an assessment"
"does  not  apply  when  a  refund  has  been  made  in  excess  of  the  amount"
"due, where an excess amount of input tax has been claimed under the VAT"
"Act.  This  special  power  given  to  assess  any  person  under  Section  22  (8)"
"applies “notwithstanding the time bar provision in Section 33” where “any"
"refund  in  excess  of  the  amount  due  or  any  excess  amount  of  input  tax"
"claimed. There is nothing in Section 22 (8) that suggests that the special"
"power of the Assessor to extend the completion of the assessment does"
"not apply where the excess input credit claim is collateral to the basis of"
"the assessment as contended by the Appellant."
