"2012 which came into effect on 15.02.2012. A perusal of the record reveals"
"that the appeal was first fixed for hearing  on 31.07.2012 (p. 58) and the"
"first  hearing  was  conducted  on  31.07.2012 
(p.  61).  The  Commission"
"consisted  of  Justice  H.  Yapa  (Chairman),  Mr.  M.Somasundara,  (Member)"
"and  Mr.  P.A.  Pematilaka 
(Member) 
(p.  79).  The  next  hearings  were"
"conducted  on  29.11.2012  (p.  119),  17.01.2013  (p.  121)    and  05.02.2013"
"before  the  same  Members  of  the  Commission  and  the  Commission"
"reserved the determination (p. 146)."
"[54] No determination was made and  in the meantime, the Tax Appeals"
"Commission was reconstituted on 09.05.2014 and the new members did"
"not  have 
the  benefit  of  hearing 
the  parties 
in  appeals  where  no"
"determination had been made by the previous Commission (p. 210). The"
"new commission consisting of Justice N. Udalagama (Chairman), Mr. M.N."
"Junaid (Member) and Mr. S. Swarnajothi (Member). The new commission"
"heard  the  parties  and  made 
the  determination  on  30.10.2014. 
It 
is"
"manifest that although the previous  commission commenced its sittings"
"on 31.07.2012 and 29.11.2012 and reserved the determination, it could not"
"practically  make  the  determination  due  to  the  expiry  of  the  term  of  the"
"commission and the reconstitution of the commission"
"[55] It is true that The Tax Appeals Commission Act has imposed a duty on"
"the Tax Appeals Commission to make the determination within the time"
"limit  specified  in  Section  10  but  the  parties  had  no  control  over  those"
"entrusted with the task of making the determination within the time limit"
"specified in Section 10. Should the parties who have no control over those"
"entrusted with the task of making the determination be made to suffer for"
"any  failure  or  delay  on  the  part  of  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  in  not"
"making its determination within the time limit specified in Section 10? I do"
"not  think  that  the  legislature  intended  that  the  time  limit  specified  in"
"Section 10 is mandatory where it is impossible for the Commission to make"
"its determination within such period due to practical reasons or where the"
"parties had no control over those entrusted with the task of making the"
"determination within the time limit specified in Section 10."
