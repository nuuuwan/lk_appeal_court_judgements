he appellant is deserved to have some reduction of the jail term. Considering"
"the  above  mitigatory  factors,  I  believe  10  years  rigorous  imprisonment  would"

"reduced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and to take effect from the date of"
"the  conviction  namely,    11th  of  September,  2020.  The  fine  and  compensation"
"awarded by the Learned High Court Judge will remain unchanged."
"Subject to the above variation of sentence, the appeal stands dismissed."
"The Registrar is directed to return the record to the High Court of Tangalle for"
"the Court to inform  the accused of the  new sentence imposed,  and to issue a"
"new committal accordingly."
"Appeal stands dismissed."
