"have watched the speech made by the Petitioner via mass media. Thus, I am of the view"
"that it is not reasonable for the Petitioner to raise an argument that he was unaware of any"
"suspicion against him on a possible crime."
"Further, on perusal of the Magistrate’s Court case record, it is apparent that the learned"
"Magistrate  has  already  issued  some  orders  under  Section  124  of  the  CCPA  to  media"
"institutions,  the  Secretary  to  the  Prime  Minster,  Indian  High  Commission,  American"
"Embassy, Shangrila Hotel etc. to hand over unedited video footage & data recorded on"
"Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) etc. to the respective investigating officers."
"Hence, based on the circumstances of this case, I am of the view that it is not this Court"
"but the learned Magistrate is the best person to assay the said speech in such lines upon"
"the material submitted before the Magistrate’s Court by the prosecution, in order to arrive"
"at decisions as to whether the Petitioner has committed an offence. Similarly, it is in the"
"hands  of  the  prosecution  or  2nd  to  4th  Respondents  to  ascertain  whether  a  credible"
"information or reasonable suspicion exists against the Petitioner and moreover, I am of"
"the view, based on my above reasoning that there exists a reasonable suspicion that the"
"Petitioner has committed an offence."
"My  view  is  that  when  taking  decisions  in  reference  to  the  case  No.  B  22046/22,  the"
"cumulative  effect  of  all  the  circumstances  and  the  nature  of  those  circumstances  of  the"
"events taken place on 09.05.2022 at Galle Face Green based on evidence will have to be"
"taken into consideration and the matters should be adjudged having regard to the ordinary"
"course of human conduct."
"Additionally, I see there is no reason to interfere in to the prosecutorial discretion of the"
"Attorney General in this case as there is no blatant error made by the Attorney General in"
"his decisions and prima facie, no evidence is available to show that he has exceeded his"
"powers.  I  drew  my  attention  to  the  provisions of  Section  393  of  the  CCPA  also  in  this"
"regard."
"In the circumstances, I am of the view that it is not possible for this Court to arrive at a"
"decision  that  the  Petitioner  has  satisfied  the  minimum  threshold  requirement  which"
"warrants this Court to issue formal notice of this application to Respondents. Thus, I refuse"
"the application of the Petitioner for notice."
"Having considered the issuance of notice, it is necessary, based on the special nature of the"
"interim orders made by this Court on 09.06.2022 to consider the aftermath consequences"
