"Counsel that this was a concocted story by the police against the appellant and"
"under the circumstances the failure by the prosecution to mention a particular"
"date as the date of offence has caused prejudice to the appellant."
"Finally, it was his submission that the case against that the appellant was not"
"proved  beyond  reasonable  doubt  before  the  Court  and  hence,  the  appellant"
"should  have  been  acquitted  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  rather  than"
"convicting him for the first and the third counts preferred against him."
"It was the submission of the learned State Counsel that no prejudice has been"
"caused to the appellant due to the wrong mentioning of the time period of the"
"offence  ending  as  at  31-04-2011  since  it  is  apparent  to  anybody  that  there  is"
"no 31st day in the month of April. Although the appellant has been admittedly"
"arrested  on  02-04-2011  there  was  no  evidence  by  any  of  the  witnesses  before"
"the trial Court that the incidents happened after the arrest."
"It  was  contended  that  there  was  no  belatedness  in  the  complaint,  given  the"
"facts  and  the  circumstances.  It  was  his  position  that  the  charges  had  been"
"correctly framed and proven beyond reasonable doubt."
