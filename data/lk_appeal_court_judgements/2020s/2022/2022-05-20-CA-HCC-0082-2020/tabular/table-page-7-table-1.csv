"reason  for  the  prosecution  to  extend  the  period  of  the  offence  up  to  a  non-"
"existing date like the 31st of April, and therefore, the charges preferred against"
"the appellant are bad in law."
"Making submissions as to the credibility of the evidence by the prosecutrix, it"
"was  contended  that  although  the  prosecution  has 
formulated  two  counts"
"against the appellant on the basis that he kissed the genital area and another"
"count on the basis on touching the genital area, apparently, based on what the"
"victim said to the police and based on the investigations, the testimony of the"
"prosecutrix before the Court was different."
"In the testimony, what she has stated was that the kissing of the genital area"

"daughter about the situation of the prosecutrix as claimed by the witnesses."
"According to the evidence of the police the child has pointed to a different place"
"as the place of the incident and she was unable to point to a particular place as"
"to where the incidents happened. It was the position of the learned President’s"
