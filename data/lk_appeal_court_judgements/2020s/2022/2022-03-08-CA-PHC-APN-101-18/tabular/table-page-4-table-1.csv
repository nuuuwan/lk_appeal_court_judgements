"This is  a revision  application  filed  on  03.10.2018  against  an  order  of  the  High"
"Court, Kandy dated 05.06.2018 which dismissed a preliminary objection raised"
"by  the  Accused-Respondent-Petitioners  (hereinafter  petitioners)  at  the  appeal"
"stage."
"The  impugned  order  deals  with  an  objection  which  contended  that  the  appeal"
"filed  by  the  Attorney  General  against  the  order  of  the  Magistrate  Court  dated"
"30.12.2015 in Case No 12670 was improperly constituted, praying for the same"
"to be dismissed. In overruling the said objection, the impugned order of the High"
"Court dated 05.06.2018 directs both  parties to proceed with the appeal before"
"High Court. Aggrieved by the said overruling, the present revision application has"
"been filed."
"Petitioners are 1st and 2nd accused in case No 12670 filed in Magistrate Court of"
"Kandy under two separate charge sheets for fraudulently consuming electricity"
"in violation of Section 67(C) of the Electricity Act No 19  of 1950.  After the two"
"charge  sheets  were  read,  the  petitioners  pleaded  not  guilty,  and  the  learned"
"Magistrate  discharged  the  petitioners  on  05.05.2014  due  to  the  lackadaisical"
"nature of the complainant."
"The case was reopened on 27.10.2014. The trial proceeded in absentia, and the"
"prosecution closed their case. However, the accused were later represented and"
"pointed  to  an  error  in  the  charge  sheet  and  requested  that  the  accused  be"
"discharged  under  Sec  186  of  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  (hereinafter  CPC)."
"Ultimately, the learned Magistrate discharged both petitioners on 30.12.2015 on"
"the basis that the charges against the accused could not be maintained. Against"
"such discharge, State filed an appeal on 01.02.2016 in the High Court of Kandy,"
"and an amended petition amending the caption was filed on 07.07.2016."
"On 19.06.2017, the preliminary objection pertinent to the instant application was"
"raised, which was subsequently overruled by the learned High Court Judge on"
"05.06.2018 by the impugned order."
