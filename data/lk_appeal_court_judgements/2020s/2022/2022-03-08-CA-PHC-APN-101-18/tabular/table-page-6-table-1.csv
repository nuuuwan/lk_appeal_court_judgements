"In  Dyson  v  Khan  31  NLR  136,  it  was  held  that:  Where  in  summary  trial  the"
"Magistrate at the close of the case for the prosecution made order discharging the"
"accused, as  the evidence failed  to establish the charge. Held  that  the order was"
"tantamount to an acquittal under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code."
"Hence,  in  answering  the  first  above,  this  Court  holds  that  the  order  of  the"
"Magistrate dated 30.12.2015 is tantamount to an acquittal."
"When considering the second issue,  the primary submission of  the  President’s"
"Counsel for the petitioner was that the appeal filed on 01.02.2016 was improperly"
"constituted as the Attorney General was not named as a party. While admitting"
"that  the  complainant  was  represented  by  a  State  Counsel  of  the  Attorney"
"General’s Department, the President’s Counsel insisted that the Attorney General"
"was  not  a  party  to  the  appeal.  Thereafter,  the  President’s  Counsel  referred  to"
"Section  318  of  the  CPC,  contending  that  the  appeal  filed  on  01.02.2016  was"
"without ‘written sanction’ of the Attorney General as stipulated under the said"
"section."
"This argument was canvassed before the High Court as well, at which instance"
"the  learned  High  Court  Judge  rejected  the  application  of  Section  318  in  the"
"instant  matter  on  the  basis  that  the  Magistrate  order  dated  30.12.2015  was  a"
"discharge and that Section 318 would only apply if the order was an acquittal."
"This Court cannot accept this reasoning. As previously examined, the said order"
"dated  30.12.2015  is  tantamount  to  an  acquittal.  Hence,  this  Court  will  now"
"ascertain whether Section 318 of the CPC is applicable."
"For this purpose, one must first refer to Section 320 of the CPC, which provides"
"‘Right  of  Appeal’.  The  said  section  stipulates  two  instances.  Subsection  (1)"
"provides for ‘any person’ to prefer an appeal against an order of Magistrate in a"
"criminal  matter, and Subsection (2)  provides ‘the  Attorney General’ may prefer"
"an appeal from the same. It is only in instances falling under Subsection (1) which"
"are subjected to Section 138 of the CPC:"
