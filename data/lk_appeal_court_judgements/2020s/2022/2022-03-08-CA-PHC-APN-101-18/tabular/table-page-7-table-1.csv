"prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against such judgment for any error"
"in law, or in fact”"
"Subsection (2), where the Attorney General prefers an appeal, such applications"
"are only subjected to Section 317 of the CPC:"
"“(2)  Subject  to  the  relevant  provision  of  section  317  the  Attorney-General"
"may prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against any judgment or final"
"order  pronounced  by  a  Magistrate's  Court  in  any  criminal  case  or  matter,"
"and where he so appeals, or where he sanctions an appeal, the time within"
"which' the petition of appeal must be preferred shall be twenty-eight days.”"
"As such, it is pertinent to glean whether the instant appeal falls under Section"
"320(1) or  Section 320(2) of  the CPC. For this purpose,  this Court will examine"
"whether the appeal filed on 01.02.2016 was filed by the Attorney General or by"
"the complainant on their own accord. At this juncture, this Court will refer to the"
"order of the learned High Court Judge dated 19.06.2017, which deals with the"
"same issue. The said order embarks on an examination of Section 320(1) of the"
"CPC in contrast to Section 320(2), to hold that the instant appeal was filed under"
"the distinct powers vested with the Attorney General under Section 320(2) of the"
"CPC. The order further holds that the appeal falls within the purview of Section"
"186 of the CPC, thereby entitling the Attorney General to file a petition of appeal"
"under  Section  320(2)  provisions  within  28  days.  Regarding  Section  320(1)  the"
"learned High Court Judge observes the following at Page 602 of the Appeal Brief:"
