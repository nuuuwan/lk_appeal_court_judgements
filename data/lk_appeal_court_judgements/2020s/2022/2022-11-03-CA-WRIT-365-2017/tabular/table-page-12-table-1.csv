"Provided that in the latter instance, if there is more than one child, the child whose sole means of"
"living is cultivation, shall be preferred to the others:"
"Provided further, if there is more than one child,  whose sole means of living is  cultivation, the"
"oldest from amongst such children shall be preferred to the others."
"We  find  that  when  a  tenant  cultivator  dies  without  nominating  a  successor,  as  stipulated  under"
"section 1D (1), the rights of the tenant cultivator devolve on the surviving spouse. Failing that, it"
"will  devolve  into  one  of  the  children  of  the  tenant  cultivator.  According  to  the  proviso  to  the"
"section, it will devolve on the child whose sole means of living is cultivating and if there is more"
"than  one  child,  the  oldest  is  preferred  over  the  others.  Even  if  we  are  to  consider  that  D.N"
"Mathangaweera  and  D.N  Saraneris  Mathagaweera  are  one  and  the  same  as  contended  by  the"
"Petitioner, he  has  failed to establish that upon the death of D.N Mathangaweera, the rights had"
"devolved on the spouse or to his son whom the Petitioner says is his father."
"It  is  observed  by  this  Court  that  his  father’s  name  is  not  reflected  in  the  paddy  land  registry."
"Petitioner has failed to provide to this Court with any material to establish that his father’s sole"
"means of living was cultivation to qualify under the proviso of 1D (1) or that his father was the"
"oldest among other children whose sole living was cultivation. Accordingly, we are unable to agree"
"with the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, that under section 1D (1), the rights"
"of  the  tenant  cultivator  devolve  on  him.  In  any  event,  section  1D  contemplates  the  tenant"
"cultivator’s son and not the grandson. Thus, in our view, the Petitioner’s contention that he is the"
"grandson who has to automatically succeed the grandfather’s tenant cultivator rights, has to fail."
"We also find the Petitioner has failed to submit any independent evidence to demonstrate that in"
"fact, he had been cultivating the land in the capacity of a tenant cultivator after the demise of his"
"grandfather. The best evidence the Petitioner could have submitted to this Court is the extract of"
"the agricultural land registry, which should demonstrate who the tenant cultivator is.  This would"
"have attracted the presumption afforded under section 53 (6) of the  Agrarian Development Act"
"No. 46 of 2000. In this instance, we find the said agricultural land registry depicts the name of the"
"2nd Respondent and not the Petitioner. We also observe that the Petitioner’s argument under Act"
"46 of 2011, whereby he argues that the rights of the tenant cultivator would devolve under section"
"6 of the amending Act, is not tenable as once again the Petitioner’s father’s name is not reflected"
"in the agricultural land registry."
