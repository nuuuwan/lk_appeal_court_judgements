"Thus, the objections of the Respondents succeed."
"This brings us to make an observation pertaining to the second relief prayed namely a writ of"
"mandamus. The Petitioner’s documents P11a-c and P12, P14 demonstrate that in fact, the Central"
"Environmental Authority and the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau have taken action against"
"the illegal mine operators whenever it had been brought to their notice. The documents clearly"
"establish that contrary to the Petitioners allegation, the authorities had not been inactive, in fact,"
"had been quite active and had prosecuted and suspended the mining license of the offender mine"
"operators if and when violations have taken place."
"In view of the above observation, this Court is inclined to accept the Respondent’s objection that"
"the Petitioner  has failed to demonstrate  whether he has brought to the attention of 1 st  to 5th"
"Respondents of specific violations and whether the said Respondents have failed or refused to"
"perform, in violation of the provisions of the respective statutes."
"Another reason why this application has to fail is that, the permits submitted to Court have all"
"expired. The permits granted have a specific time period. None of the parties submitted to this"
"Court any new permits. Thus, issuing a writ to quash a nonexistent permit is futile. It is trite law"
"that Courts will not issue a prerogative writ if it is futile."
"However, this Court observes that in granting approvals and licenses for mining activities, 1st -6th"
"Respondents should strictly adhere to the provisions of the respective statutes that govern them"
"and should be satisfied that the requirements are met before issuing the approvals and the said"
"approvals should be granted according to law."
"Therefore, after considering all the materials submitted and the submissions made, this Court"
"finds the objections raised by the Respondents succeed.  In any event, we find that the Petitioner"
"has failed to establish his case to the satisfaction of this Court."
"Accordingly, we are not inclined to grant the reliefs prayed and for the reasons set out in this"
"judgment, this application is dismissed without cost."
