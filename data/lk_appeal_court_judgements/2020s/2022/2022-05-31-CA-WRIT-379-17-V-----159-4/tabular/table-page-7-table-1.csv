"The Respondents answering this allegation contended that, the 6th to 13th Respondents are valid"
"license holders of mainly the 1st Respondent, the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau and have"
"obtained all the approvals necessary from the relevant stakeholders to function."
"A
s per the material submitted to this Court, and as per the submissions of the parties, we find that"
"the 6th  to 13th  Respondents have conducted mining operations with a valid permit. Thus, the"
"Petitioner’s contention of Respondents carrying out illegal mining operations fails."
"This  Court  will  now  examine  the  Petitioner’s  second  allegation  that   the  Respondents  are  in"
"breach of the conditions of the permit."
"To   substantiate   this   allegation,   the   Petitioner   relies   on  a   newspaper   article   (P4)  and   several"
"photographs (P5a to P5c) which shows soil being removed from an undisclosed location. The"
"6th,7th, 9th,11th,12th  and 13th  Respondents while denying these photographs, contended that they"
"were not engaged in gravel or soil mining. The 8th  Respondent who had a permit for gravel"
"excavation denied that the photographs were from his site. We find the Petitioner too does not"
"make a direct allegation nor does he attribute the said photographs to the sites of 6th  to 13th"
"Respondents. The next two documents, the Petitioner relied on are P6, and P7 which also does"
"not reflect that the said documents are pertaining to the mining sites of the said Respondents."
"However, as per P8, it is clear that there had been several issues pertaining to the sites where the"
"quarries are situated. Accordingly, the Geological Surveys and Mines Bureau had called for a"
"meeting   with   the   stakeholders   which   includes   the   6th 
to   13th  Respondents.   The   Petitioner"
"contended that the said meeting was to discuss the violations of conditions in the permit by"
"mining operators including the 6th to 13th Respondents. This was vehemently denied by the said"
"Respondents."
"The said Respondent’s contention on the said meeting was that the meeting was not pertaining to"
"any issues regarding them, but involved other mining operators who are not a party to this action"
"and pertaining to the transport of metal from the quarries. None of the parties have submitted the"
"minutes  of the meeting  or the recommendations  and conclusions  of the said meeting  to this"
"Court. Thus, the reason the meeting was called, is in dispute."
"The Petitioner also brought to our attention documents P10, P11(a-e), P12, P14, and P15 to"
"demonstrate the illegal mining operations that are carried out. However, we observe that P10"
"which is a police complaint has no relevance to the 6th to 13th Respondents. It is observed that the"
"documents   P11(a)   to   11(e),   P12,   P14,   and   P15   too   have   no   relevance   to   the   6th 
to   13th"
"Respondents. The document P13 is a report on a site where gravel is extracted as stated earlier in"
"this Judgment it is common ground that 6th to 13th Respondents except for the 8th Respondent is"
