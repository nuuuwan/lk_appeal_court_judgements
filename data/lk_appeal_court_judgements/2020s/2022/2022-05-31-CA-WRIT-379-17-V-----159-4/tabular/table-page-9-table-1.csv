"the Petitioner has failed to comply with Rule 3(1) of the Court of Appeal rules. The said rule"
"states as follows,"
"Rule 3(1)(a) “Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the powers"
"vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 and 141 of the Constitution shall be by way of"
"petition,   together   with   an   affidavit   in   support   of   the   averments   therein,   and   shall   be"
"accompanied by the originals of documents material to such application (or duly certified"
"copies thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender any such"
"document, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the leave of the Court to"
"furnish such document later. Where a petitioner fails to comply with the provisions of this"
"rule, the Court may ex mero motu or at the instance of any party dismiss such application."""
"The   Respondents   contended   that   the   Petitioner   has   failed   to   submit   certified   copies   of   the"
"documents and has failed to obtain the permission of this Court to submit the same at a later"
"stage. It was also contended that the document marked P4, a newspaper article does not even"
"display the name of the newspaper."
"The second contention of the Respondents was that the Petitioner has failed to comply with Rule"
"3(2) of the Court of Appeal rules. The said rule states as follows,"
"“The petition and affidavit, except in the case of an application  for the exercise  of the"
"powers conferred by Article 141 of the Constitution shall contain an averment that the"
"jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal has not previously been invoked in respect of the same"
"matter. If such jurisdiction  has previously been invoked the petitioner shall contain an"
"averment   disclosing   relevant   particulars   of   the   previous   application.   Where   any   such"
"averment as aforesaid is found to be false or incorrect the application may be dismissed.”"
"The Petitioner has failed to answer these objections. The Court of Appeal Rules are there to be"
"observed.  Our Courts   have  taken  a  strict  view   on compliance   with  the  rules.  In  Woodman"
"Exports   (Pvt)   Ltd   Vs   Commissioner   General   Labour   and   others   2010   (BLR)   238  the"
"Supreme Court held that “The non-compliance with a mandatory Rule by a party could lead to"
"serious   erosion   of   well-established   Court   procedures   maintained   by   our   Courts   throughout"
"several decades and therefore the failure to comply with Rule 8(3) of the Supreme Court Rules"
"would necessarily be fatal.”"
"In the case of  Caderamanpulle and Others Vs Caderamanpulle and Others (2005) 1 SLR"
"398, Amaratunge J cited the case of Perera v Perera where Udalagama J observed, “This Court"
"on numerous occasions held that in applications for leave to appeal, compliance with Rule 3(1)"
"of the Supreme Court Rules 1990 pertaining to appellate procedure is mandatory.” (page 31)"
"Having made the above observation, this Court proceeded to dismiss the application with the"
"following words, “I am compelled to hold that non-compliance with the Supreme Court Rules is"
"fatal to the application and proceed to sustain the preliminary objection raised by the defendant-"
"petitioner-respondent and dismiss this application with costs."""
