"necessary parties, held as follows, “In the context of writ applications as a necessary party is one"
"without whom no order can be effectively made. A proper party is one in whose absence an"
"effective order can be made but whose presence is necessary to a complete and final decision on"
"the question involved in the proceedings. If they are not made parties then the petition can be"
"dismissed in limine. It has also been held that persons vitally affected by the writ petition are all"
"necessary parties. If their number is very large, some of them could be made respondents in a"
"representative capacity. In view of the above judgment, the Respondent’s objection succeeds."
"Thus, we hold the petitioner has failed to make all the parties that are necessary and who will be"
"affected by the orders of this Court."
"Petitioner’s   prayer   is   vague   thus   no   relief   can   be   granted   and   the   application   is"
"misconceived in law."
"The Petitioner’s first relief sought is for a writ of certiorari. The said prayer prays as follows;"
"Grant and issue an order in the nature of a writ of certiorari directing the 1-5 th Respondents to"
"quash/annul, cancel/suspend the approvals so far granted by them for carrying out the mining"
"operations in the “Goolshaneally Watte” alias “Neelawalangala Watte” and in the area of the"
"close vicinity."
"When this Court asked on what grounds the Petitioner is seeking this relief, the Petitioner was"
"unable to give a direct answer. Further, this Court observes that the prayer seeks to quash all the"
"approvals so far given, it does not give a time period which means that it is a blanket application"
"to quash all the permits issued, irrespective of a time limit, and it does not disclose to whom the"
"permits have been issued. This Court is kept in oblivion as to whether the permits have been"
"issued only to 6th  to 13th  Respondents in this case or whether any other mining operators are"
"involved. If so, issuing a writ of certiorari as pleaded by the Petitioner will result in quashing the"
"permits issued to parties who are not before this Court and who are not a party to this case, and"
"who have no allegations against them."
"Furthermore, the relief sought has to fail as the Petitioner is seeking to quash approvals given,"
"not only pertaining to Goolshaneally watte alias Neelawalangala watte but even to areas in close"
"vicinity. The Petitioner is seeking this relief without properly identifying the areas that are in"
"close vicinity and without disclosing up to what extent this close vicinity expands."
"In his submissions, the Petitioner offered another vague answer to this objection and submitted"
"that the area where the mining is carried out is depicted in a Google map marked P3 but stopped"
"short of identifying a clear location. This Court also observes that the Petitioner is not seeking a"
"writ of certiorari based on the said Google map but is seeking to cover an undisclosed area by"
"using the word “vicinity”. It is well established that a Petitioner who seeks relief in a judicial"
"review application cannot succeed if his prayer is vague and also, he cannot couch all imaginable"
"reliefs in the prayer. The Petitioner should know what his grievance is and be specific as to the"
"relief he is seeking."
