"n Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah [1982] 2 SLR 693, Sharvananda J. (as he then was) stated that,"
"“On the other hand, if the dispute is in relation to any right to any land other than right"
"of possession of such land, the question for decision, according to Section 69(1), is who"
"is entitled to the right which is subject of dispute. The word “entitle’’ here connotes the"
"ownership of the right.  The Court has to determine which of the parties has acquired"
"that right, or is entitled for the time being to exercise that right.  In contradistinction to"
"Section  68,  Section  69  requires  the  Court  to  determine  the  question  which  party  is"
"entitled to the disputed right preliminary to making an Order under Section 69(2)”."
