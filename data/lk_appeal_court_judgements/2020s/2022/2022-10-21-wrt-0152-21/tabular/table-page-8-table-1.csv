"However, since the said order marked P2 cannot prevail in law as mentioned"
"above, all the proceedings and the steps flowing from the said decision are"
"also bad and cannot prevail in law. Any such outcome of a void decision shall"
"have the same effect as if it was void. Therefore, a Writ of Certiorari to quash"
"the said order marked P3 would not arise."
"In the circumstances and the reasons mentioned above, I am inclined to issue"
"a Writ of Certiorari quashing the order marked P2. Furthermore, the Board is"
"directed to consider all the evidence which has already been led before it and"
"make  an  appropriate  order  in  respect  of  the  possession  of  the  impugned"
"property  as  provided  under  Section  19(1A)  of  the  Debt  Conciliation  Board"
"Ordinance and proceed accordingly. I order no costs."
