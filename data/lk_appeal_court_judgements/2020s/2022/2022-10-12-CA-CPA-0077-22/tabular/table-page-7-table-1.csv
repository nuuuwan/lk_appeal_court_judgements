"has  not  been  previously  canvassed  before  this  Court  in  applications  of  this"
"nature.  The  impugned  order  in  the  instant  case  has  referred  to  the  Hansard"
"concerning  the  interpretation  of  Section  13  of  the  Commission  Act  and  has"
"refused to uphold the objection of the petitioner. Having carefully considered the"
"submissions of the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel for the petitioner and the learned"
"Deputy Solicitor General, the material placed by the petitioner before this Court"
"and  especially  the  nature  of  the  objection  in  relation  to  the  interpretation  of"
"Section 13(1) of the Commission Act, this Court is satisfied of the existence of"
"prima facie exceptionality which warrants the issuance of formal notice on the"
"respondents."
"Accordingly, notice issued."
