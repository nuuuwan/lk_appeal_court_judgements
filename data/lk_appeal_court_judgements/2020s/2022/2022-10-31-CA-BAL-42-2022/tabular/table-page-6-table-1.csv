"","Minutes dated 05.10.2022 that “Whereas the law does not construe the"
"","incarceration  of  a  suspect  pending 
investigation  as  amounting 
to"
"","punishment, it does indeed restrict the inherent rights and freedoms of"
"","the suspect, which are ensured by the Constitution”. As the Supreme"
"","Court speaking through the then Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva held in"
"","Anuruddha Ratwatte and Others v. The AG (2003) 2 Sri L.R. 39"
"","(page 43-46): “Every day spent in incarceration constitutes deprivation"
"","of personal liberty…The right to liberty and security of person is a basic"
"","tenet of our public law and is universally recognized as a human right"
"","guaranteed to every person (vide Article 9 of the Universal Declaration"
"","of Human Rights and Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and"
"","Political  Rights).  Based  on  this  right  to  liberty  and  security  of  person,"
"","Article 13 of the Constitution guarantees as a fundamental right to every"

the
