"(22) 
Hence it is clear that giving reasons (a letter of intimation) is ideally"
"before making an assessment. Hence further there is no “assessment” at"
"the  time  of  giving  reasons,  unless,  as  decided  by  the  learned  Chief"
"Justice, reasons accompany the statutory notice of assessment."
"(23) 
The  said  principle  that  an  “assessment”  becomes  valid  only  when"
"statutory “notice of assessment” is given, was followed in the Indian case"
"of The Secretary of State for India in Council vs. Seth Khemchand"
"Thaoomal  and  others,  1923  decided  in  the  Court  of  the  Judicial"
"Commissioner, Sind."
"(24) 
The court in that case said, “The only way that an assessee could"
"be said to be charged is by a demand notice issued by the income"
"tax  officials,  for  till  then  it  cannot  be  argued  that  he  has  been"
"charged with the payment of any tax”."
"(25) 
In that case, the tax payer could have instituted a suit and recovered"
"the 
tax  paid  because 
there  was  no 
“assessment”.  There  was  no"
"“assessment” because there was no notice, a demand, a charge within"
"the  limited  period.  This  shows  that  an  “assessment”  becomes  a  valid"
"“assessment” only when “notice of assessment” is given."
"(26) 
The court held that an attempt made by the state to invoke the aid"
"of a confidential note, within the stipulated time, cannot be tax charged"
"within  the  year  and  that  the  said  argument  has  no  substance  in  it."
"Similarly, the argument of the respondent in the present case that the"
"“assessment” [which is actually an “estimate” in the legal sense] made"
"without sending notice of assessment can be the assessment fails."
