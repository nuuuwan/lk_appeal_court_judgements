Justice  Victor  Perera  followed  the  definition  of  “estimate”  given  in"
"the  Shorter  Oxford  Dictionary  which  is  an  “approximate  calculation"
"based  on  probabilities”.  He  said,  “the  “estimate”  becomes  the  basis  of"
"assessment of the taxable income”."
"(19) 
Both courts agreed that giving reasons cannot be after the sending"
"of  the  notice  of  assessment,  which  both  courts  appear  to  have"
"considered as synonymous with making the assessment."
"(20) 
Hence both Justice Victor Perera and the learned Chief Justice have"
"based their judgments on the premise that “making the assessment” is"
"same as “giving notice of assessment”. This was why it has been argued"
"by 
learned  Counsel 
in  C.A. 
(TAX)  17/2017 
that  no 
lawfully  valid"
"assessment  can  be  made  without  first  serving  a  notice  of  assessment."
"The  court  in  C.A.  (TAX)  17/2017  considered  that  this  is  a  practical"
"impossibility such as a letter cannot be sent until it is written. But what"
"was  meant  is  not  that.  An  “assessment”  becomes  valid  only  when  the"
"“notice of assessment” is given."

The early case of Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Saverimuttu"
"Chetty decided by Abrahams C.J., when the first Tax Ordinance No. 02"
"of 1932 was only 04 years old, shows that there was a procedure under"
"section 69(2) where the Commissioner can direct the assessor to make"
"further  inquiry  and  there  can  be  an  adjustment  between  the  assessor"
"and the assessee. This procedure would expedite the recovery of tax by"
"the state, without having to wait on the uncertain outcome of a lengthy"
"litigation.  This is what Justice Victor Perera meant when His Lordship"
"said reasons for not accepting the return should precede the statutory"
"notice of assessment under section 95, so that the assessee can make"
"representations to the assessor."
