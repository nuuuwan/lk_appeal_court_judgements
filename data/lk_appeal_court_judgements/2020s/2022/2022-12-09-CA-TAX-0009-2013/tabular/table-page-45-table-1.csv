"(27) 
The court considered the absence of notice of assessment as a patent"
"error of law in the assessment."
"(28) 
The  plain  reading  of  the  term  in  question  in  section  17(2)  of  the"
"Inland 
Revenue 
Act 
which 
is 
“industrial 
and  machine 
tool"
"manufacturing” shows that it means “industrial tool manufacturing” and"
"“machine tool manufacturing”."
"(29) 
Having  correctly  understood  the  aforementioned  position,  the  Tax"
"Appeal  Commission  erred  when  it  looked  at  the  dictionary  meaning  of"
"the term “tool”, whereas it should have  considered the meaning of the"
"phrase “industrial tool manufacturing”."
"(30) 
Here using the word in its ordinary meaning was at variance with"
"the intention of the legislature, which was to be derived from the statute"
"itself,  because 
the 
term  used  was  not 
“tool”  as 
the  Tax  Appeal"
"Commission thought but “industrial tool manufacturing”."
"(31) 
While  the  product  of  the  appellant  comes  within  the  definition  of"
"“industrial tool manufacturing”, the question of law No. 05 will not arise."
"(32) 
The Assessor is not authorized to issue two assessment for the same"
"year  of  assessment 
for  the  same  matter. 
In  D.M.S.  Fernando  vs."
"Mohideen  Ismail,  it  was  said,  “The  new  procedure  would  also  have"
"the effect of fixing the Assessor to a definite position and not give"
"him latitude: to chop and change thereafter”."
