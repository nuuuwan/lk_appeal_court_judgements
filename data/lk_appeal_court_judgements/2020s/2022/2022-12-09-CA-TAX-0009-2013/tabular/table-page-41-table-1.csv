"(TAX)  17/2017  said  they  are  not  relevant,  the  superior  courts  of  this"
"country  have  examined  the  procedure  followed  in  the  Inland  Revenue"
"Department in estimating, assessing, sending notice of assessment and"
"giving reasons for non acceptance of the return."
"(7) The decision in C.A. (TAX) 17/2017 is based on the English case of Honig"
"and others vs. Sarsfield (inspector of Taxes) (1986) BTC 205."
"(8) As  it  is  clear  from  the  perusal  of  the  judgment  in  Honig  and  others"
