"respondent, it was submitted that the following matters were within the contemplation of"
"the learned High Court Judge at the time of imposing the sentence:"
"(a)  The accused-appellant was 49 years and the Prosecutrix was 07 years old at the time"
"of the commission of the offences as such the accused-appellant being an adult was"
"42 years older than the Prosecutrix."
"(b) There is a steady increase in the number of sexual offences being committed in Sri"
"Lanka and there is a significant increase in the cases relating to child abuse"
"The learned counsel for the respondent argued that the accused-appellant has exploited the"
"immaturity of the Prosecutrix and caused her to engage in sexual activities with the accused-"
"appellant. The impact of the offence on the Prosecutrix has to be considered with due weight."
"The evidence of the Prosecutrix in terms of provisions of the Protection of Victims of Crime"
"and Witnesses Act No 04 of 2015 (as amended) indicates that the incidents occurred due to"
"her immaturity."
"One of the primary intentions of the legislature in enacting Act No 22 of 1995 which brought"
"in the enhancement of punishment in the form of a minimum mandatory sentence for the"
"offence  of  Statutory  Rape  has  been  the  prevention  of  sexual  exploitation  of  children  and"
"protection of children. A child of 7 years does not have the mental maturity or perception to"
"give  consent  to an  act of  sexual  intercourse.  The  child  is  not  mindful of  the  gravity of the"
"consequences attendant upon the physical act of intercourse and therefore the criminal law"
"has  protected  that  child  by  declaring  that  the  act  of  intercourse  per  se,  whether  there  is"
"consent or not, constitutes rape."
"The legislature in it its wisdom has also expressly provided that persons below the age of 16"
"years,  who  themselves  fall  within  the  definition  of  ""child""  will  not  attract  the  minimum"
"mandatory sentence if sexual intercourse has been committed with ""consent""."
"This is found in the Proviso to section 364 (e) which reads as follows:"
"Provided, however, that where the offence is committed in respect of a person under"
"sixteen, years of age, the court may, where an offender is a person under eighteen"
"years of age and the intercourse has been with the consent of the person, impose a"
"sentence of imprisonment for a term less than ten years;"
"No such leniency has been intended by the legislature in respect of an â€œadult"" who has sexual"
"intercourse with a ""child"". It is my view that the punishment imposed by the Learned High"
"Court Judge is reflective of the following considerations relating to Sentencing:"
"(a)  the gravity of the offence"
"(b) the degree of culpability and responsibility of the offender"
"(c)  the punishment provided in the statute"
"(d) difficulty in detection of the offence"
"(e)  the interest of the society"
