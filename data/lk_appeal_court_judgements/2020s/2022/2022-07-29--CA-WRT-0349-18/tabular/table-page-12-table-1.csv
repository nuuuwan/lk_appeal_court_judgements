"In  the  Appeal,  it  was  argued  by  Mr.  E.B.  Wickramanayake  Q.C  that  on  being"
"robed the Plaintiff-Appellant (Pupil) acquired a certain status and he could not"
"be  deprived  of  that status  except  upon due  inquiry  after proper  charges  had"
"been framed against him. Sansoni J (with T.S. Fernando J agreeing) held that on"
"the facts of that case an inquiry was not necessary. Therefore, an inquiry is not"
"an essential pre-requisite to expel a Samanera Bhikku from pupilship. Depending"
"on the facts and circumstances of the case it can be done without an inquiry."
"In  any  event,  this  court  cannot  question  the  validity  of  the  decision  of  the"
"Mahanayaka Thero. That decision is judicially not reviewable."
"S.A. De Smith in his “Judicial Review of Administrative Actions” 5th edition page"
"186 says thus “Decisions of Leaders of particular faiths on disciplinary issues are"
"also, as authorities stated, not judicially reviewable”. That is because there is no"
"sufficient  public  element  and  statutory  underpinning.  Further,  questions  of"
"religious law and faith are not appropriate subjects of judicial review."
"In  the  case  of  Rev.  Keselwatugoda  Chandananda  Thero  v  Rev  Sirimalwatte"
"Ananda  Mahanayaka  Thero  1996  (2)  SLR  287  Dr.  Ranaraja  J  observed  as"
"follows:-"
"“The relationship of tutor and pupil is sufficient to make the pupil bound by a"
"judgment. It must be assumed that when the Maha Nayaka Thero informs the"
"Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs of a decision to alter the entries in the register"
"of  Bhikkus  in  respect  of  a  Bhikku  of  a  particular  Nikaya  that  an  ecclesiastical"
"dignity of that eminence would act with a proper sense of responsibility.”"
"The ratio decidendi of that judgment can be summarized as follows:-"
"“Discipline of Bhikku is a matter governed by Vinaya Pitakaya, the inquiry into"
"the charges and taking necessary action is a matter for the religious bodies. The"
"Buddhist Ecclesiastical Tribunals are private in nature, they are not statutory"
"bodies but institutions set up by each Nikaya to regulate its own internal affairs.”"
"In  the  matter  of  an  Application  by  Rev.  Sumana  Thero  to  be  admitted  and"
"enrolled  as  an  Attorney-at-Law  2005  (3)  SLR  365,  Samarakoon  C.J  (with"
"Samarawickrama J, Walpita J and Gunasekera J agreeing) held that the Vinaya"
"Pitakaya  containing  the  rules  and  conduct  of  the  Bhikkus  are  of  a  purely"
"ecclesiastical  nature  and  the  Supreme  Court  has  constantly  held  that,  such"
"matters are outside the pale of the civil law and cannot be entertained as legal"
"disputes in Civil Courts."
