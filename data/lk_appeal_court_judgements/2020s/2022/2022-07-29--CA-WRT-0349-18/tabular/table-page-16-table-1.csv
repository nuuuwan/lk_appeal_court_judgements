"Therefore, the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs was justified in altering"
"the register at the 1st request of the Mahanayaka Thero. The Mahanayaka Thero"
"had  altered  his  register  earlier.  He  had  notified  the  Commissioner  about  the"
"alteration and the Commissioner was aware of the contents of the alteration."
"The Mahanayaka Thero had conveyed to the Commissioner the exact contents"
"of the alteration. However, when the 2nd request to alter the register was made"
"by the Mahanayaka Thero there was no evidence before the Commissioner that"
"the  register  in  the  custody  of  the  Mahanayaka  Thero  has  been  altered.  The"
"Mahanayaka Thero did not say that he altered his register. The Commissioner"
"cannot make any alterations in his register until the Mahanayaka Thero alters"
"his  register.  The  Mahanayaka  Thero  has  to  alter  his  register  first. 
If  the"
"Mahanayaka Thero had altered his register, he should inform the Commissioner"
"what he has altered. The Commissioner should be aware of the alterations done"
"by the Mahanayaka Thero because he has a duty to alter his register accordingly."
"The  Commissioner 
is  expected  to  make  the  same  alteration  done  by  the"
"Mahanayaka Thero. The two alterations should be similar. In this case, when the"
"Commissioner altered his register for the 2nd time there was no evidence before"
"the Commissioner about the alterations (if any) done by the Mahanayaka Thero."
"Without knowing what alterations had been made by the Mahanayaka Thero"
"and without knowing whether there had been an alteration in the register in the"
"custody of the Mahanayaka Thero and without verifying whether an alteration"
"had been made in the register in the custody of the Mahanayaka Thero and if so"
"without  verifying  about  the  contents  of  the  alteration,  the  Commissioner"
"General of Buddhist Affairs had altered the register in his custody. This act of the"
"Commissioner is clearly ultra vires."
"For the aforementioned reasons, I issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of"
"Certiorari  quashing 
the  endorsement  and/or  alteration  made  by 
the  1st"
"Respondent  on  04.09.2018  on  the  declaration  regarding  Samaneras  under"
"section 41 of the Buddhist  Temporalities Ordinance no. 19 of 1931 produced"
"marked P21 to the following effect:-  “වනවාස සංඝ සභායවන් ඉවත් කර අංක 89633"
"දරණ යමම සාමයේර භික්ෂුන් පිලිබඳ ප්‍රකාශෙ අවලංගු කරන ලදී.”"
"Subject  to  the  aforementioned  limitation  the  application  is  allowed  without"
"costs."
