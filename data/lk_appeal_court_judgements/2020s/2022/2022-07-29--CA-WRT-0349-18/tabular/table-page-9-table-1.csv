"The learned Additional Solicitor General who appeared for the 1st to 5th and 7th"
"to 9th Respondents and the learned Counsel for the 12th Respondent submitted"
"that the decision of the Sangha Sabhawa or the Mahanayaka Thero of the Nikaya"
"cannot  be  questioned  by  this  court  and  that  decision  is  not  reviewable.  The"
"learned Additional Solicitor General further submitted that the Commissioner"
"General of Buddhist Affairs was not exercising a discretion and his act is purely"
"a ministerial function."
"In paragraphs 84, 85 and 86 of the Petition and in the corresponding paragraphs"
"of the affidavit, the Petitioner states as follows:-"
"84) 
Further, 
the  Petitioner 
states 
that 
the  1st  Respondent  being 
the"
"Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs is duly bound in terms of the law, the"
"Rule of Law, Due Process, equal protection of the law and entrenched principles"
"and  doctrines  of  administrative  law,  (as  he  is  exercising  a  strictly  statutorily"
"designed and delineated power, and is the final authority who decides the issue"
"of 
de-registering 
a 
Samanera 
under 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Buddhist"
"Temporalities Ordinance) to verify objectively (if no reasons or justification are"
"adduced or if inadequate or facile reasons or justifications are adduced) as to"
"why the state machinery and the Department of Buddhist Affairs and he, as the"
"apex  functionary  thereof, 
in  his  capacity  as  the  Commissioner  of  Buddhist"
"Affairs, should act on a utterly arbitrary, mala fide, ad hoc, capricious act of"
"the head of the Nikaya and lend the imprimatur of the state machinery in order"
"to marginalize a Samanera on a random basis. In any event, as will be elucidated"
"before Your Lordshipsâ€™ Court during the course of the hearing, there has been a"
"total non-compliance with the provisions and stipulations and requirement of"
"Section 41(5) and also the situation contemplated in the said statutory section,"
"which 
is  of  prime 
importance,  within 
the  statutory  scheme,  as  will  be"
"demonstrated,  has/have  not  been  fulfilled.  This  is  clearly  borne  by  the  letter"
"dated  13.8.2018,  purportedly 
issued  by 
the  10th  Respondent 
to 
the  1st"
"Respondent-Commissioner."
"85) 
Accordingly, due to the patent non-fulfilment and non-satisfaction of the"
"requirement  of 
the  prefatory  portion  of  Section  41(5)  of 
the  Buddhist"
"Temporalities Ordinance No. 19 of 1931 as amended, the Commissioner General"
"of  Buddhist  Affairs,  being  the  1st  Respondent,  could  very  simply,  not  have,"
"under any circumstances, de-registered the Petitioner from the official register"
"of Samaneras maintained under Section 41 of the Ordinance."
