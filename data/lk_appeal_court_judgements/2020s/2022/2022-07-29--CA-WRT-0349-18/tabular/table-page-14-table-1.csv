"41(5)  of 
the  Buddhist  Temporalities  Ordinance  of  1931  was  extensively"
"discussed in the case of Maha Nayaka Thero of Malwatte Viharaya v Registrar-"
"General 39 NLR 186."
"In  that  case,  the  Mahanayaka  Thero  of  the  Malwatte  Chapter  wrote  to  the"
"Registrar-General that he had removed one Ratanajothi Thero’s name from his"
"register 
and 
requested 
the 
Registrar-General 
to  make 
the 
necessary"
"modification  under  Section  41(5)  of  the  Ordinance.  This  request  was  not"
"complied with, a similar request was made subsequently with the same effect."
"Thereafter,  the  Mahanayaka  Thero  asked  for  a  writ  of  mandamus  on  the"
"Registrar-General. The Registrar-General refused to modify the register on the"
"ground that the Ordinance does not contemplate expulsion from priesthood. It"
"was  held  that  the  position  taken  up  by  the  Registrar-General  has  no  legal  or"
"logical justification."
"It was held that the Registrar-General is under a legal duty under Section 41(5)"
"of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance No. 19 of 1931 to remove the name of"
"a  Buddhist  Priest 
from 
the  register  on  being  required 
to  do  so  by 
the"
"Mahanayaka on the ground that the priest has been expelled from the order."
"Justice Soertsz observed as follows:-"
"“I am therefore of the opinion that if the matter stood in this position, and no"
"other considerations arose, a clear case has been made out for the issue of a"
"writ directing the Registrar-General to modify his register. It is a duty the statute"
"casts upon him in imperative terms. It gives him no discretion and he is usurping"
"functions he does not possess when he acts in the manner in which he acted in"
"this case.”"
"Therefore,  the  Commissioner  General  of  Buddhist  Affairs 
is  performing  a"
"ministerial  act  when  he 
is  acting  under  Section  41(5)  of 
the  Buddhist"
"Temporalities  Ordinance.  He  has  no  discretion  and  he  cannot  question  the"
"validity  of 
the  decision  of 
the  Mahanayaka  or 
the  Sangha  Sabha.  The"
"Commissioner-General 
is  under  a 
legal  duty  under  Section  41(5)  of 
the"
"Ordinance to remove the name of a Buddhist Priest from the register on being"
"required to do so by the Mahanayaka on the ground that the Priest has been"
"expelled from the order or in other instances like this to make the necessary"
"alterations."
"The Petitioner has drawn our attention to the document marked P26 signed by"
"the two Anunayakas of the Nikaya and the chief Lekhakadhikari of the Nikaya"
