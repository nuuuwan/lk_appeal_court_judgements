"license of the 1st Plaintiff and on a balance of probability of evidence, the learned"
"District Judge was justified in coming to that conclusion."
"The next question that has to be taken into consideration is whether the 7th and"
"8th Defendants were in exclusive possession of the corpus. The 1st Plaintiff had"
"admitted that the 7th and 8th Defendants were residing in the corpus since 1974"
"which  means  that  the  7th  and  8th  Defendants  had  been 
in  uninterrupted"
"possession for more than 10 years prior to the institution of the partition action."
"The  question  that  has  to  be  considered 
is  whether  their  possession  was"
"undisturbed and whether they were in exclusive possession or their possession"
"was disturbed by the 1st Plaintiff. The 7th and 8th Defendants cannot establish an"
"undisturbed possession if the 1st Plaintiff also had possessed the corpus along"
"with the 7th and 8th Defendants. The 1st Plaintiff in his evidence had stated that"
"he took the produce of the corpus while the 7th and 8th Defendants were residing"
"in  the  corpus.  On  the  other  hand,  the  8th  Defendant  had  stated  that  the  1st"
"Plaintiff and the other co-owners never possessed the corpus and she possessed"
"the corpus exclusively and took the entire produce. The learned District Judge"
"who  had  seen  and  heard  the  witnesses  has  preferred  to  accept  the  8th"
"Defendant’s version and has refused to accept the 1st Plaintiff’s version and he"
"was justified in coming to that conclusion. After taking into consideration the"
"infirmities of  the  evidence  of  the  1st  Plaintiff  regarding  the  plantations  in  the"
"corpus, the learned District Judge has refused to accept the evidence of the 1st"
"Plaintiff that he possessed the corpus. The 1st Plaintiff in his evidence had stated"
"that he leased out the coconut trees in the corpus. But as the learned District"
"Judge  has  correctly  observed  the  Plaintiffs  had  failed  to  adduce  evidence  to"
"establish that fact. In any event, the learned District Judge could not have acted"
"on that evidence in view of the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence of the 1st"
"Plaintiff specially in a situation where he had rejected the evidence of the 1st"
"Plaintiff  regarding  the  character  of  possession  of  the  7th  and  8th  Defendants"
"which gives rise to the concept of the indivisibility of the credibility of a witness."
"The learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs-Appellants in his written submissions has"
"drawn our attention to the evidence of the defense witness Mendis – another"
"Grama Niladhari of the area. In his examination in chief, this witness had stated"
"as follows;"
"ප්‍ර : එවිට එතන පදිිංචි ්වලා සටි්ේ ්ම් අය විතරයි?"
"උ : ඔව්."
