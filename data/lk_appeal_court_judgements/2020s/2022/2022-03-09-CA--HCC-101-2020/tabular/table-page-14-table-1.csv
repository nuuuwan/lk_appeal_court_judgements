[2000]  Sri  LR  245,  F.N.D"
"Jayasuriya J stated that ""when the defence contends that there is a vital"
"omission  which  militates  against  the  adoption  of  the  credibility  of  the"
"witness,  it  is  the  Trial  Judge  who  should  peruse  the  information  book"
"and decide on that issue."""
"Therefore,  this  irregularity  does  not  warrant  to  vitiate  the  conviction.  If"
"the witness denied making such a statement, it becomes a contradiction"
"and  not  substantial  evidence.  But  here,  the  witness  admitted  making"
"such a statement and he further said it was true. Therefore, it becomes"
"substantial evidence."
