"identification of the appellant as the person who shot at the deceased by PW-01"
"was clouded with doubt and cannot be considered a positive identification. He"
"was  of  the  view  that  a  conviction  on  such  an  identification  was  not  safe,  and"
"therefore, appellant should be given the benefit of the doubt created as to the"
"identification."
"It was the view of the learned  Deputy Solicitor General  (DSG)  that PW-01 has"
"clearly  identified  the  appellant  at  the  time  of  the  incident.  Refering  to  the"
"evidence led at the trial, he contended that PW-01 has seen the appellant three"
"times within a short span of time after the incident. She has seen him firing at"
"the deceased  and fleeing the scene of the crime. Later she  has seen the same"
"person  running  towards  a  hill  which  was  near  her  house  while  firing  at  his"
"pursuers and has also seen him after his arrest by the police. She has given a"
"clear description as to the body features of the appellant and reasons as to why"
"she  was  unable  to  clearly  see  the  face  of  the  appellant.  Submitting  that  the"
"learned High Court Judge has well considered the question of the identity of the"
"appellant and has come to a firm finding that the prosecution has established"
"the identity of the appelant beyond reasonable doubt, it was his view that the"
"judgement needs no disturbance by this Court."
"I am of the view that, as pointed out correctly by the learned DSG, this was not"
"an incident where the PW-01 only had the opportunity of having looked at the"
"appellant  for  few  seconds.  She  had  been  very  clear  in  her  evidence  that  the"
"appellant first came and questioned her whether she saw someone passing the"
"area. When she replied, the appellant has run away and had been confronted by"
"the  deceased.  She  has  seen  him  entering  the  forest  area  after  committing  the"
"crime.  Within  an  hour  of  the  incident,  she  has  again  seen  the  same  person"
"running  while  firing  at  the  fellow  villagers.  Later,  the  same  person  has  been"
"apprehended.  She  has  given  a  clear  description  as  to  a  special  feature  she"
"observed on the hair of the appellant. The same feature had been observed by"
"PW-03 as well, when he confronted the thieves who were holding his sister-in-"
"law in the morning."
