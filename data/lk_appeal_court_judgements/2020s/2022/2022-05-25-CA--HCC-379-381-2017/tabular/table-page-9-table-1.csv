econd  and  the  third  accused.    The  second  appellant  contends  that  non-"
"summary  proceedings  were  not  valid 
in 
law. 
  The  appellant  had  been"
"absconding for nine years. The police have recorded a statement from the wife"
"and the mother-in-law of the second accused-appellant.  He surrendered to the"
"High Court  after nine  years.  The  second  appellant  was  given every chance to"
"put  forward  any  defence  in  the  High  Court.    Therefore,    it  cannot  be  argued"
"that he was not given a fair trial, on the basis that he did not participate in the"
"non-summary proceedings."
"One of the grounds of appeal set forth by the third appellant is that the learned"
"High Court Judge,  who delivered the judgment had not adopted the evidence"
"recorded by her  predecessor.  The learned  High Court Judge  had adopted the"
"evidence  on  a  subsequent  date  with  the  consent  of  all  appellants. 
 
(vide"
"proceedings 
of  14th  March  2006,)  none 
of 
the  accused-appellants  had"
"demanded  the  witnesses  to  be  re-summoned  and  re-heard.    Thus  the  learned"
"Trial  Judge  has  sufficiently  complied  with  the  provisions  of  section  48  of  the"
"Judicature Act."
"The next ground of appeal raised by the third appellant is that after the death"
"of 
the  second  accused, 
the 
indictment  was  amended  but 
the  amended"
"indictment was not read to the appellants.  The counsel for the third appellant"
"has  drawn  attention 
to  page  228  of 
the  brief. 
  However,  on  page  117,"
"proceedings  dated  13th  February  2012, 
the 
learned  State  Counsel  who"
"appeared for the prosecution made an application to amend the indictment,  as"
"the  second  accused  was  dead.  As  per  the  proceedings,  the  indictment  was"
"amended  accordingly, 
 
inserting  the  name  of  the  deceased  accused. 
  The"
"amendment  was  informed  to  the  accused  and  explained.    They  pleaded  not"
"guilty  on  the  14th  of  March,  2016.    Only  the  words  “තිස්  දෙවෙ  ව න්තිය  සම"
"කියවන්ෙ” were added on 14/3/2016. Counsel for the defence did not object to"
"this  application. 
  Therefore, 
there  had  been  no  prejudice  caused 
to 
the"
"appellant."
