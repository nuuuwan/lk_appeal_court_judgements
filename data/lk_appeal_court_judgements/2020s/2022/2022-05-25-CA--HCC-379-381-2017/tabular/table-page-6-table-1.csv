"b
ut  it  was  the  first  information  received  by  the  police  which  led  the  police  to"
"arrive at the crime scene and to take immediate action. The police had started"
"the  investigation  on  the  complaint  made  by  PW2.  The  fact  that  the  deceased"
"had left for the boutique at around 9.00 a.m is not hearsay.  The fact that her"
"daughter  informed  him  of  the  incident  was  not  hearsay.    The  learned  Trial"
"Judge  had  only  stated  that  PW2  had  made  the  first  complaint  to  the  police"
"mentioning 
four  names  and 
the  police  had 
taken  action  based  on 
that"
"complaint.   The learned Trial Judge has not stated that the first complaint was"
"admitted  as  evidence. 
  The 
learned  Trial  Judge  has  mentioned 
that 
the"
"complaint was made without delay.  The Learned Trial Judge has not acted on"
"inadmissible  evidence  to  convict  the  appellants.  The  learned  Trial  Judge  has"
"mentioned the following:"
"“ඒ අනුව පළවෙ  විත්තිකරු හා ෙැෙට මියද ාස් සිටිෙ විත්තිකරු කැදේ සිට එක පාරටම"
"පාරට පැෙ තම සදහෝෙරයාට දවඩි තෙෙ ලෙ ෙවට පැ.සා. 01 විසින් සිද ධිය සිදුවු දිෙට,"
"පසුදිෙ ඇති ප්‍රකාශ දේ සඳහන් කරුණ පිළි ත හැකිය.”"
"Counsel  for  the  appellant  vehemently  attacked  this  portion  in  the  judgment."
"Counsel for the  appellant submitted  that the learned Trial Judge  had  violated"
"the  provisions  of  section  110  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code.    In  this  regard,"
"he  cited  the  case  of  Rathinam  vs  Queen  74  NLR  371.    The  above  portion  was"
"mentioned  by  the  learned  Trial  Judge  when  considering  a  contradiction  to"
"compare 
it  with  what  has  been  stated  by  PW1 
in  court. 
  However, 
the"
"conviction  was  based  on  the  evidence  that  had  been  led  before  the  court  and"
"not  on 
inadmissible  evidence. 
  The 
learned  Trial  Judge  did  not  use  the"
"statement to the police as a basis for the conviction."
"The  contradictions  of  V1  and  V2  have  been  considered  by  the  learned  High"
"Court  Judge  and  she  has  come  to  the  conclusion  that  they  did  not  go  to  the"
"root  of  the  matter.  The  contradiction  of  V1  was  with  regard  to  what  the"
"appellants were wearing at the time of the incident.  This is not a material fact"
