"The evidence in High Court is that immediately after the first two accused had"
"shot  the  deceased,  the  third  and  the  fourth  also  had  come  and  stabbed  the"
"deceased.    Few  minutes  means  a  very  short  time.    When  someone  describes"
"something,  the  most  appropriate  words  may  not  come  out  to  describe 
it"
"correctly and properly.  The Judge has decided that the contradiction does not"
"go to the root of the matter and that has no  affect to the fact, that the accused"
"had shot or the accused had stabbed the deceased. Therefore, I see no reason"
"to disagree with these findings of the learned High Court Judge."
"The  appellants  have  made  dock  statements.  The  first  appellant  took  up  the"
"position  that  he  was  in  hospital  when  he  was  arrested  and  he  denied  any"
"involvement in  the  death of the deceased.  The second  appellant  also took up"

"He  further  stated  that  the  family  members  of  the  deceased  were  involved  in"

"activities.    As  such,  they  have  implicated  the  third  accused  in  this  incident."
"The  claims  of  the  third  appellant  were  not  put  to  the  witnesses.    None  of  the"
"appellants  has  put  their  defences  to  the  prosecution  witnesses.    The  learned"
"Trial Judge has observed that none of the appellants produced any evidence to"
"support their position.  The appellants took this observation as the judge had"
"imposed a burden on them to prove their case."
