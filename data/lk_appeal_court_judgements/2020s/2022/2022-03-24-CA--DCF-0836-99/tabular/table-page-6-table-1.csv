"වි5.  Further,  the  Defendant  had  admitted  that  the  corpus  in  this  case  (නමම"
"නඩුවට අදාළ ඉඩම) is situated on the east."
"The 
learned  Counsel  for  the  Defendant-Appellant  had  submitted  that  the"
"learned District Judge had not considered the evidence of the two surveyors in"
"totality. That cannot salvage the Defendant’s case. According to the plan marked"
"පැ1 there are physical demarcations in the four boundaries of the land shown as"
"the corpus by the Plaintiffs. Thus, the land appears as a distinct and a separate"
"entity of land. As shown in the plan there is a fence and a road on the northern"
"boundary. There is a fence and a road on the eastern boundary also. There is a"
"fence on the southern boundary and there is a canal on the western boundary."
"The 1st Plaintiff had stated  in his  evidence that the land was fenced  on three"
"sides – East, South and West. There was no fence on the northern boundary."
"Even  on  the  western  boundary  where  there  was  a  canal  separating  this  land"
"from the land to the west where the Defendant was living, there was a fence."
"This evidence can be accepted for the following reasons,"
"According  to  both  plans,  පැ1  and  වි5  there  is  no  fence  along  the  western"
"boundary  of  the  land  in  dispute.  Only  the  canal  is  shown  along  the  western"
"boundary. But the 1st Plaintiff said that there was a fence in addition to the canal"
"along the western boundary. In the Police Complaint marked පැ5, the 1st Plaintiff"
"had told the Police that the Defendant destroyed the fence that was there on"
"the  western  boundary  of  the 
land  shown  by  the  Plaintiffs  as  the  corpus."
"Therefore,  the  evidence  of  the  1st  Plaintiff  that  there  was  a  fence  along  the"
"western  boundary  can  be  accepted.  That  shows  that  the  land  shown  by  the"
"Plaintiffs as the corpus was a distinct and separate land and not a part of the"
"Defendant’s land which adjoins it on the western boundary and not a portion of"
"the larger land shown in වි5. The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted"
"that the learned District Judge had failed to consider the Defendant’s  version"
"which is more probable. For the aforesaid reasons, the Defendant’s version is"
"highly improbable."
"Therefore,  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  of  evidence,  one  can  come  to  the"
"conclusion that the land described in the schedule to the Plaint, which is the"
"corpus in this case is depicted as lots ‘අ’ and ‘ආ’ in the plan marked පැ1. The"
"Plaintiffs  have  established  the  identity  of  the  corpus  and  the  learned  District"
"Judge has come to a correct conclusion regarding that."
