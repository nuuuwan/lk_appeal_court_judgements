"In  R  v.  Voisin  [1918]  1  K.B.  531  it  was  held  that  there  is  a  discretion  to"
"exclude evidence obtained in breach of the rules."
"T
herefore, the Appellant is successful on his first ground of appeal for the"
"reasons stated above."
"As the second and third grounds of appeal are pertaining to the evidence led"
"at the trial, the said grounds would be considered together in this appeal. In"
"those grounds the Learned President’s Counsel contends that the whether a"
"reasonable  doubt  would  arise  on  the  prosecution  case  in  view  of  the  vital"
"discrepancies 
in  the  evidence  of  PW2  and  whether  the  circumstantial"
"evidence led at the trial is adequate to establish the guilt of the Appellant."
"P
W2 was the security guard at the place of incident on the date of incident."
"He has neither witnessed the incident nor apprehended the Appellant at that"
"time.  PW2 confirmed that only when the owner of the massage parlour called"
"him and when he went into the room, he found the deceased lying down with"
"a knife penetrated into her body, and that the Appellant was being held by"
"the owner and the establishment's staff. He had then wrapped the deceased"
"with a bedsheet and taken the deceased to hospital with the help of the three-"
"wheeler driver and the next-door gentlemen. His evidence is insufficient to"
"consider against the Appellant in view of the rejection of the evidence of PW1."
"Further, I consider the contradictions marked on his evidence as vital as it"
"certainly affects the root of the case."
"The  Learned  President’s  Counsel  also  submitted  to  this  court  that  the"
"Learned High Court Judge, in his judgment has failed to consider that this"
"was  a  matter  pertaining  to  circumstantial  evidence  and  it  was  incumbent"
"that the court should have considered matters pertaining to circumstantial"
"evidence.  The  consideration  that  should  apply 
in  a  case  pertaining  to"
"circumstantial evidence has completely escaped the mind of the trial judge."
