"were  subsequently  sent  to  the  Government  Analyst  for  examination."
"PW1,  the  main 
investigating  officer  and  PW4  have  given  evidence"
"about the raid at the trial."
"T
he  defence  position  suggested  to  the  PW1  was  that  a  woman  called"
"“Srimathi”  had  been  arrested  in  another  raid  on  the  same  day  when"
"she  was  in  a  three-wheeler  (not  the  appellant’s  three-wheeler)  and"
"heroin  found  on  her  was  implicated  to  the  appellant.  However,  when"
"the  appellant  made  a  dock  statement,  he  stated 
that 
the  said"
"“Srimathi”  and  two  other  friends  were  in  the  three-wheeler  driven  by"
"him,  they  were  arrested  and  taken  to  the  Borella  police  station."
"According  to  the  appellant,  his  sister 
(first  accused)  and  her  son"
"(second accused) were also arrested when they were in the house and"
"then they were also brought to the police station. In the police station,"
"heroin  was 
introduced  to  them  as  well  as  to  the  “Srimathi”,  the"
"appellant said in his dock statement. It is very clear that the position"
"suggested to the main investigating officer and the position  taken up"
"by  the  appellant 
in  his  dock  statement  are  totally  contradictory."
"Therefore,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  very correctly  rejected  these"
"completely  contradictory  and  unreliable  two  versions  of  the  defence."
"Although 
the  defence  versions  are  rejected, 
the  prosecution  case"
"would  not  succeed.  The  prosecution  has  to  prove  its  case  beyond  a"
"reasonable doubt."
"A
t  the  hearing  of  the  appeal,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant"
"confined  his  arguments  to  the  issue  of  the  appellant's  knowledge  of"
"the offence although three grounds of appeal have been stated in the"
"appellant's  written  submissions.  Accordingly, 
the 
learned  Deputy"
"Solicitor  General  also  made  submissions  only  with  regard to  the  said"
"ground of appeal."
"T
he argument of the learned counsel for the appellant was that even if"
"the  prosecution  version  that  her  sister,  the  first  accused,  was  found"
"4"
