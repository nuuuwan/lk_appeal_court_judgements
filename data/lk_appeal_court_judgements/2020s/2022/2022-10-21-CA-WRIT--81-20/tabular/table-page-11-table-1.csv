"This  is  untenable.  To  quote  the  words  of  his  Lordship  Fernando  J.  in  Bandara  v."
"Premchandra [1994] 1 SLR 301:"
"“It may well be that in the United Kingdom the prerogative in regard to office held at"
"p
l
easure was very wide. However, any such prerogative recognised or conferred under a written"
"Constitution such as ours, with a separation of functions, must necessarily be subject to"
"l
i
m
itations.” [emphasis added]"
"The Indian Supreme Court in B.P. Singhal (supra) also observed:"
"“As a result when the Constitution of India provides that some offices will be held during"
"the pleasure of the President, without any express limitations or restrictions, it should however"
"necessarily be read as being subject to the ""fundamentals of constitutionalism"". Therefore in a"
"constitutional set up, when an office is held during the pleasure of any Authority, and if no"
"l
i
m
i
tations or restrictions are placed on the ""at pleasure"" doctrine, it means that the holder of the"
"o
f
f
i
ce can be removed by the authority at whose pleasure he holds office, at any time, without notice"
"and without assigning any cause. The doctrine of pleasure…… does not dispense with the need for"
"a
 
cause for withdrawal of the pleasure. In other words, ""at pleasure"" doctrine enables the removal"
"o
f
 a person holding office at the pleasure of an Authority, summarily, without any obligation to"
"give any notice or hearing to the person removed, and without any obligation to assign any reasons"
"or disclose any cause for the removal, or withdrawal of pleasure. The withdrawal of pleasure cannot"
"be at the sweet will, whim and fancy of the Authority, but can only be for valid reasons.” [emphasis"

"The following passage from Wade and Forsyth’s, ‘Administrative Law’ (on page 27)"
"is apposite to quote:"
"“It is a cardinal axiom that every power has legal limits. If the Court finds that the power"
"has been exercised oppressively or unreasonably, or if there has been some procedural failing…"
"the act may be condemned as unlawful. Although lawyers appearing for  government departments"
"have often argued that some Act confers unfettered discretion on a minister, they are guilty of"
"constitutional blasphemy. Unfettered discretion cannot exist where the rule of law reigns. The"
"same truth can be expressed by saying that all power is capable of abuse, and that the power to"
"prevent abuse is the acid test of effective judicial review.”"
"When  the  pleasure  principle  was 
in  operation,  prior  to  its  abolition  by  the"
"Seventeenth Amendment, there were significant limitations."
"In the case of Bandara (supra) it was held that:"
"“Article 55(5) makes the ""pleasure principle” subject to the fundamental rights and the"
"l
anguage rights; Article 55(1) makes it “subject to the provisions of the Constitution”, so that other"
