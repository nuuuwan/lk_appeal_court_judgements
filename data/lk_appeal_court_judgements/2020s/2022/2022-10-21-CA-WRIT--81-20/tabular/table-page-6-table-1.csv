easure, except in cases where, for the public good, it has been determined that Some other tenure"

better.”"
"The rationale of this principle of Common Law is explained in Wade and Forsyth’s,"
"‘Administrative Law’ 11th Edition (on page 49) thus:"
"“The  basis  of  the rule  that  Crown  servants  are  dismissible  at  pleasure,  therefore,  is  the"
"principle  that  the  public  interest  requires  that  the  government  should  be  able  to  disembarrass"
"itself of any employee at any moment. All the emphasis was on public policy.”"
"As Lord Diplock explained in the  Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for"
"the Civil Service [1985] AC 374:"
"“…. The theory that those by whom the administration of the realm is carried on do so as personal"
"servants of the monarch who can dismiss them at will, because the King can do no wrong.”"
"Lord  Reid in  the  landmark judgment  of  Ridge v.  Baldwin  (supra)  propounded  a"
"threefold classification of employment relationships. The first class is the master-servant"
"relationship. The master is at liberty to terminate the services of the servant at any time,"
"even without reason. The remedy of the servant is for damages for breach of contract. The"
"second  deals  with  persons  who  hold  office  at  pleasure.  The  third  category  deals  with"
"officeholders  whose  dismissal  cannot  take  place  without  cause  and  where  the  rules  of"
"natural justice must be adhered to."
"Expanding on the second category, Lord Reid stated as follows:"
"“Then there are many cases where a man holds an office at pleasure. Apart from judges"
"and others whose tenure of office is governed by statute, all servants and officers of the Crown hold"
"o
f
f
i
ce at pleasure…… It has always been held, I think rightly, that such an officer has no right to"
"be heard before he is dismissed, and the reason is clear. As the person having the power of dismissal"
"need not have anything against the officer, he need not give any reason…… I fully accept that"
"where an office is simply held at pleasure the person having power of dismissal cannot be bound"
"to disclose his reasons. No doubt he would in many cases tell the officer and hear his explanation"
"before deciding to dismiss him. But if he is not bound to disclose his reason and does not do so,"
"then, if the Court cannot require him to do so, it cannot determine whether it would be fair to hear"
"the officer's case before taking action.” [emphasis added]"
"This passage was cited with approval in the cases such as Kulatunge v. The Board"
"of  Directors  of  the  Co-operative  Wholesale  Establishment 
(supra),  Yakkaduwe  Sri"
"Pragnarama Thero v. The Minister of Education 71 NLR 506, Fernando v. Jayaratne 78"
