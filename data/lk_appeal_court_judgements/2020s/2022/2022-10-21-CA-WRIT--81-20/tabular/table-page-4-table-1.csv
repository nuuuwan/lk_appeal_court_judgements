"The  Respondents’  contention  is  that  in  terms  of  Section  6(1)  of  the  Marriage"
"Registration  Ordinance,  a  Registrar  holds  office  at  the  pleasure  of  the  appointing"
"authority (in this case the Registrar General). It reads as follows:"
"The Registrar General may appoint one or more persons to each such division, who shall be called"
"Registrars of Marriage, and any such registrar at pleasure he may remove and appoint some other"
"person in his place………… [emphasis added]"
"When removal can be done “at pleasure” it is claimed that the Registrar General"
"exercised unfettered discretion and is thereby not duty-bound to disclose reasons for his"
"decision  to  remove.  Reliance  is  placed  on  the  case  of  Thenabandu  v.  Samarasekera  70"
"NLR 472 to substantiate the position of the Respondents."
"Further, the Respondents claim that the Petitioner was aware of this because of"
"his letter of appointment (“P6”) which provides that the Petitioner was to be on probation"
"for a period of 11 months, from the date of appointment. Upon completion of that period"
"and  other  conditions  such  as  passing  a  written  exam,  if  his  work  is  satisfactory,  the"
"appointing authority would consider making him permanent.  The fifth condition in the"
"letter  stipulated  that  his  services  could  be  terminated  at  any  time,  without  notice  or"
"reason."
