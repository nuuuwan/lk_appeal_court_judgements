"between  them.  Although  the  witness  has  admitted  that  they  had  a  previous"
"enmity,  he  has  maintained  the  position  that  it  was  the  appellant  who  fired  at"
"him. Under cross-examination, it becomes clear that the witness was not certain"
"as to what type of a gun the assailant was carrying."
"The  doctor  who  examined  the  PW-01  three  days  after  the  incident  at  the"
"Negombo General Hospital has given evidence and had marked his Medico-Legal"
"Report  (MLR)  as  P-01.  When  narrating  the  incident  to  the  doctor,  PW-01  has"
"informed him the incident which was consistent with what the PW-01 had said"
"in the Court. The doctor has observed two injuries on his right thigh, which he"
"has observed as an entry wound and exit wound. However, he has stated that"
"by  the  time  he  examined  the  patient,  the  wounds  had  already  been  treated,"
"therefore,  he  was  unable  to  determine  whether  the  wounds  were  gunshot"
"wounds. However, he has stated that the two wounds were parallel to each other,"
"and has expressed the opinion that if not treated promptly, they could be fatal"
"due to the loss of blood."
"The police officer who has conducted the investigations has also given evidence"
"in  this  action.  He  had  been  the  Officer-in-Charge  (OIC)  of  the  Negombo  police"
"station when this incident was reported to him around 21.00 hours on 12-07-"
"2005. Upon the receipt of the first information, he had visited the scene of the"
"crime around 21.45 hours and had recorded his observations. It was his evidence"
"that he could not find evidence of a gun being fired at that time, and he could"
"not find any blood stains as well. It had been his evidence that he inspected the"
"area using the torch he was carrying and since the injured had been taken to"
"the hospital, he took steps to record his statement and came to know about four"
"suspects involved in the incident. Although he looked for them, he could not find"
"them in their houses, but later came to know that they have surrendered to the"
"Magistrate Court somewhere in August."
"Under cross-examination, when asked as to what type of light was available and"
"how he made his observations at the  scene of crime, he has stated that there"
