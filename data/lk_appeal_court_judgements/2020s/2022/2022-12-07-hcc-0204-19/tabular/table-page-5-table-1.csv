"","charge  at  any 
time  before 
the 
judgment 
is"
"","pronounced.  However,  it  is  incumbent  upon  the"
"","Court  to  ensure  that  no  prejudice  is  caused  to"
"","the  accused  in  doing  so.  In  this  case,  the  alias"
"","name  of  the  appellant,  ‘Bunchi’,  which  was  the"
"","name  that  has  been  used  to  identify  him  by  the"
"","people known to him, was allowed to be added in"
"","the  indictment  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge"
"","on an application made by the prosecution at the"
"","trial.  At  the  time  the  amendment  was  made,  the"
"","only  evidence  that  has  been  led  was  part  of  the"
"","examination 
in  chief  of 
the 
first  eye  witness."
"","Hence, 
the  appellant  had 
the  opportunity 
to"
"","cross examine all the eye witnesses who testified"
"","in 
Court 
after 
the 
amendment. 
Thus, 
no"
"","prejudice  has  been  caused  to  the  appellant  by"
"","allowing  the  above  amendment  by  the  learned"
"","High  Court  Judge.  The  appellant  had  sufficient"
"","notice of what he was charged for and he was not"
"","misled  by 
the  amendment. 
In 
the 
interest  of"
"","justice, 
the 
learned  High  Court 
Judge  has"
"","correctly  allowed 
the  amendment.  Thus, 
this"
"","ground of appeal has no merit."
"5.","Ground of Appeal No. 2"
"","The learned President’s Counsel for the appellant"
"","submitted  that in  terms  of the medical evidence,"
"","two  weapons  has  been  used  to  cause  injuries  to"
"","the  deceased.  One  knife  has  been  a  two  edged"
"","one 
and 
the 
other  has  been 
single 
edged."
"","However,  according  to  the  evidence  of  the  eye"
"","witnesses,  only  the  2nd  accused  appellant  has"
"","stabbed  the  deceased.  Therefore,  the  evidence  of"
"","the eye witnesses is not credible."
"6.","It is important to note that, the eye witnesses for"
"","the  prosecution,  PW1  and  PW2  were  consistent"
"","in  giving  their  evidence  on  the  fact  that  the  2nd"
"","accused  stabbed 
the  deceased  on  his  chest."
