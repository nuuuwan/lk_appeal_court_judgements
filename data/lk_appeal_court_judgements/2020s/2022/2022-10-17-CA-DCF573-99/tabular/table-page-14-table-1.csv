"In the case of Weerakoon Vs Lenoris Waas 52 CLW 70, where the Trial Judge"
"had  proceeded  to  allot  certain  plantations  and  buildings  among  some  of  the"
"Defendants  after  investigating  their  rights,  after  the  dismissal  of  a  partition"
"action on the ground that the Plaintiffs had no title to the corpus, Basnayake ACJ"
"(with Pulle J agreeing) observed as follows,"
"“We do not think that after having dismissed the action on the ground that the"
"plaintiff had no title the learned District Judge had any jurisdiction to proceed to"
"allot the plantations and the houses among the parties to it.”"
"For the aforementioned reasons, we see no merit in this appeal. We are of the"
"view that the learned District Judge has come to a correct conclusion in this case"
"and we see no reason to interfere with those findings. Therefore, we affirm the"
"judgment of the learned District Judge dated 29.01.1999 and dismiss this appeal."
"In the circumstances of this case, we make no order for costs."
