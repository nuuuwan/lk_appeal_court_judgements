"The Supreme Court held that the learned District Judge had not investigated a"
"title of the parties to the action. Eva Wanasundara – J has observed as follows,"
"“According  to  the  way  he  has  written  the  judgment,  if  it  is  decided  that  the"
"Plaintiff  is  correct,  it  is  not  necessary  to  look  into  other  issues  raised  and/or"
"other claims placed before court by others even though they all lead evidence"
"of the trial.”"
"In that case the learned District Judge had failed to investigate title of all the"
"parties by not answering the issues raised by the Appellants on their paper title."
"The  learned  District  Judge  had  just  held  that  the  shares  should  be  allocated"
"according to the pedigree of the Plaintiff without considering the claim of the"
"Appellants put forward by their issues."
"A similar situation arose in the case of Sopinona Vs Pitipanaarachchi and two"
"others  [2010]  1  SLR  87.  In  that  case  also  the  District  Judge  had  ordered  to"
"partition the corpus. The Respondent’s allegation before the Court of Appeal"
"was that their deeds were not at all considered. The learned District Judge had"
"decided  on  the  allocation  of  shares  in  accordance  with  the  pedigree  of  the"
"Plaintiff without examining the title of all the parties and without examining and"
"considering  the  deeds  produced  by  the  Appellants.  Thus,  the  learned  District"
"Judge failed to analyze the totality of the evidence lead at the trial. The learned"
"District Judge had answered only one issue – namely issue no. 01 raised by the"
"Plaintiff which he had answered in the affirmative. That issue was based not only"
"on the devolution of title of the Plaintiff but also on the prescriptive rights of the"
"plaintiff. Therefore, it became necessary to consider and analyze the evidence"
"to ascertain whether parties disclosed in the plaint had prescribed which the"
"learned District Judge had failed to do."
"In  Sopinona’s  case  Saleem  Marsoof  –  J  observed  thus,  “In  fact  a  careful"
"examination of the issues formulated at the commencement of the trial in this"
"case  shows  that  there  was  no  way  in  which  the  court  could  have  avoided"
"answering all the issues raised at the commencement of the trial and it is ironic"
"that the learned trial Judge had gone through the entire trial but had chosen to"
"answer only issue – 01. Indeed, if the learned District Judge had focused even"
"for  a  moment  on  the  other  13  issues,  she  may  have  answered  issue  –  01"
"differently.”"
"In the same judgment, Dr. Justice Bandaranayake – J had observed as follows,"
