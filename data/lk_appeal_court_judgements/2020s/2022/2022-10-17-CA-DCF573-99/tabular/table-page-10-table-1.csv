"the Plaintiff in this case who had purchased the rights of the transferors which"
"are yet to be determined in the partition action is not even entitled to be a party"
"to this action on that basis. Those rights will accrue to the Plaintiff only after the"
"entry  of  the  final  decree  of  this  case.  Those  rights  cannot  be  allotted  to  the"
"Plaintiff by the judgement and the interlocutory decree in this case. The Plaintiff"
"did not have those rights at the time of the institution of this partition action. In"
"the case of Silva Vs Fernando 15 NLR 499 it was held that the rights of the parties"
"to an action have to be ascertained as at the commencement of the action. In"
"the case of Thalagune Vs De Livera [1997] 1 SLR 253 Senanayake – J held that it"
"is settled law. Therefore, the Plaintiff in this case did not have any undivided"
"rights in the corpus at the time of the institution of this partition action and he"
"was  not  a  co-owner  of  the  corpus  within  the  meaning  of  Section  02  of  the"
"Partition Law No. 21 of 1997. Therefore, the original Plaintiff was not entitled in"
"law  to  institute  and  maintain  this  partition  action  and  therefore  the  learned"
"District Judge was justified in dismissing this partition action on that basis as the"
"Plaintiff had also failed to prove his inheritance under Ukkuthina."
"When this matter was taken up for argument, the learned President’s Counsel"
"for the Plaintiff-Appellant submitted to court that the learned District Judge had"
"failed to answer  all the issues raised at the trial. Instead, the learned District"
"Judge had dismissed the case by answering only two issues.  Therefore, it was"
"the submission of the learned President’s Counsel that the case should be sent"
"back to the District Court for a trial de novo without going into the merits of the"
"case.  I have expressed the opinion  that the court cannot decide whether the"
"learned District Judge should have answered all the issues instead of disposing"
"the case by answering only two issues without going into the merits of the case."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Plaintiff-Appellant  has  relied  on  the"
"judgments of Sopinona Vs Pitipanaarachchi and two others [2010] 1 SLR 87 and"
"Madduma  Ralalage  Susil  and  others  Vs  Madduma  Ralalage  Mary  Nona  and"
"others [2016] 1 SLR 49. Both those judgments have to be considered in the light"
"of the circumstances of those cases."
"The case of Madduma Ralalage Susil and others Vs Madduma Ralalage Mary"
"Nona and others [2016] 1 SLR 49 was a case where the learned District Judge"
"had ordered to partition the land. The main grievance of the Appellants against"
"the judgment of the District Court was that all the issues raised at the trial were"
"not answered by the Trial Judge and by doing so, the court had not investigated"
"the title of the parties concerned."
