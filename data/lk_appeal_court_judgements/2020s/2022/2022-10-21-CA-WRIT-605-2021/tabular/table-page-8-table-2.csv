"In light of the above, I take the view that there is no merit in the objections raised on behalf"
"of  the  1st  to  8th  and  10th  to  12th  Respondents  at  this  stage  on  futility  and  after  a  careful"
"consideration of the overall circumstances of this case, I proceed to reject such objections"

"For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the Petitioner is entitled to be appointed"
"as the GM of the CEB upon the retirement of Eng. Ranatunga, who was the previous GM,"
"reaching the age of 60 years. Thus, I issue a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 8th and"
"10th  Respondents  to  appoint  the  Petitioner  as  the  General  Manager  of  the  Ceylon"

"the Petitioner in CA/Writ/02/2022 has subsequently changed, I see no reason to take in"
"to consideration the other reliefs sought by the Petitioner in this application."
