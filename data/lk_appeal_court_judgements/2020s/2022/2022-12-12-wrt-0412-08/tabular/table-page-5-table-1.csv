"on the date of the publication of the approval of the minister or on a latter date"
"as maybe specified in the resolution. Therefore, the calculation of the taxes from"
"01.01.2007 by the 1st Respondent is erroneous, unlawful and ultra vires as the"
"resolution was not in operation as at that date. Therefore, P16 is liable to be"
"quashed on that ground alone."

"The learned  Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the Entertainment Tax"
"Ordinance  was  enacted  in  1946  at  a  time  when  the  concept  of  Theme  Park/"
"Amusement  Park  was  never  envisaged.  Therefore,  the  Entertainment  Tax"
"Ordinance  as  it  stands  today  cannot  encompass  leisure  parks  which  provides"
"amusement to the public."

"persons are admitted for payment but does not include stage play, theatrical,"
"puppetry, ballet and other performances on stage of a like nature.”"

"that you do for pleasure and that needs physical effort or skill, usually done in a"
"special area and according to fixed rules.”"
