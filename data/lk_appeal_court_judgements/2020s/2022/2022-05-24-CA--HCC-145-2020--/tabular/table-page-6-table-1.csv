"Seneviratne 53 NLR 354 and Sheela Sinharage v. The Attorney-General [1985] 1"
"Sri LR 1.‚Äù"
"When  it  states  that  evidence  given  by  a  witness  in  a  judicial  proceeding  or"
"before  any  person  authorized  by  law  to  take  it  is  relevant  in  a  subsequent"
"judicial proceeding or in a later stage of the same proceeding provided the three"
"conditions  laid  down  in  S.33  are  present,  such  evidence  is  relevant  for  the"
"purpose of proving the truth of the facts which it states."
"Merely because the eyewitness testimony at the trial emerges from a section 33"
"conduit, it does not lose its weight if it contains sufficiently probative material."
"The  provisions  of  law  allow  to  admit  evidence  given  in  judicial  proceedings  as"
"admissible  for  the  purpose  of  proving  the  truth  of  facts  when  that  witness  is"
"dead, provided the said evidence had been between the same parties, and the"
"accused  had  the  right  and  opportunity  to  cross-examine  the  witness  whose"
"statement  is  to  be  admitted  in  evidence,  and  that  the  issue  was  substantially"
"the same in both the proceedings."
"The narrated testimony acquiesced in by S.33 was originally given on oath and"
"was subject to cross-examination. The solemnity of the previous occasion and"
"the circumstance that the evidence was capable of being filtered, as it were, by"
"cross-examination  justify  its  reception  in  the  later  proceeding.  Thus,  the  first"
"and second grounds of appeal cannot be succeeded."
"The  next  contention  was  that  the  Learned  Judge  had  failed  to  consider  any"
"exception contained in S.294 of the Penal Code."
"The position of the appellant is that he grappled with the deceased during the"
"brawl,  as  the  deceased  tried  to  use  a  knife,  which  caused  the  injury  on  his"
"palm.  There  was  evidence  that  the  appellant  was  a  toddy  tapper  and  always"
"had  a  sharp  knife  with  him.  The  appellant  tried  to  say  that  he  did  not  know"
