"Hence, I find that, there was no basis to consider that the common intention has"
"been proved."
"As I have stated before, there may be serious suspicions that can be directed at"
"the  first  accused  appellant  as  he  was  found  driving  a  three-wheeler  with  a"
"damaged windscreen 4 Km away from the scene of the crime. However, since the"
"prosecution has failed to connect that fact to any other evidence to establish the"
"first appellant’s or the second appellant’s involvement beyond reasonable doubt"
"against them to the crime, I am of the view that the conviction was bad in law"
"and cannot be allowed to stand."
"In view of the determinations on the above considered grounds of appeal, this"
"Court is of the view that the rest of the grounds of appeal urged by the learned"
"Counsel need not be considered,  as the appeals should in anyway succeed as"
"stated above."
"Therefore,  allowing  the  appeals,  I  set  aside  the  conviction  and  the  sentences"
"imposed  on  the  accused  appellants  and  acquit  them  of  the  charges  preferred"
"against them."
"Appeals allowed."
