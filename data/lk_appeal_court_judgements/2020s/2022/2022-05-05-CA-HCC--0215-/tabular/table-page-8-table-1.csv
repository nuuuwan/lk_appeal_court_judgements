"In  the  case  of  Moonesinghe  vs  Vidanage  69  NLR  97  the  Privy  Council  held  as"
"follows:"
"“ If there is no evidence to support a particular conclusion (and this is really a"
"question  of  law)  the  appellate  court  will  not  hesitate  so  to  decide.  But  if  the"
"evidence  as  a  whole  can  reasonably  be  regarded  as  justifying  the  conclusion"
"arrived at at the trial, and especially if that conclusion has been arrived at on"
"conflicting  testimony  by  a  tribunal  which  saw  and  heard  the  witnesses,  the"
"appellate court will bear in mind that it has not enjoyed this opportunity and"
"that  the  view  of  the  trial  judge  as  to  where  credibility  lies  is  entitled  to  great"
"weight.  This  is  not  to  say  that  the  judge  of  first  instance  can  be  treated  as"

"In  the  case  of  Alwis  vs  Piyasena  Fernando  1993  1  Sri  LR119,  His  Lordship"
"Justice G.  P. S.de Silva  CJ made the following observation:"
"“it is well established that findings of primary facts by a trial Judge who hears"
"and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on appeal”."
"In  this  case,  PW1  was  only  15  years  old  at  the  time  of  the  incident.  Having"
"considered the above-mentioned legal literature and the contradiction that had"
"been  brought  to  the  notice  of  the  court,  I  hold  that  those  two  contradictions"
"and the omission do not go to the root of the case. Therefore, I find no reason"
