"Inside  the  boat  they  have  found  three  more  parcels  of  similar  size  near  the"
"person  who  throw  one  of  them  to  the  sea.  Upon  inspection,  brown  coloured"
"powder  has  been  discovered  in  the  parcels  and  PW-01  had identified  them  as"
"Heroin  and  the  three  persons  have  been  arrested.  PW-01  has  observed  the"
"person  who  broke  open  one  of  the  parcels  before  it  was  thrown  into  the  sea"
"with a brown-coloured powder all over his face and the T-shirt he was wearing."
"The witness has identified the appellants as the three persons arrested by him"
"from the dingy boat at the trial before the High Court."
"After their arrest, PW-01 and his team of officers had pursued the Indian vessel"
"which  was  attempting  to  get  away  and  stopped  it  as  well,  and  arrested  the"
"occupants  of  the  boat,  whom  he  has  identified  as  the  4th  to  the  8th  accused"
"before the High Court. He has identified the 8th accused as the skipper of the"
"vessel.    He  has  recovered  GPS  mobile  communication  devices  from  both  the"
"vessels  among  other  things  recovered.  After  the  arrests,  PW-01  has  taken"
"arrested  persons  and  the  productions  recovered  under  his  custody  and  had"
"taken  them  to  the  Kankesanturai  harbour,  where  they  were  stationed  at  that"
"time.  They  have  reached  the  harbour  at  around  6.00  hours  on  the  following"
"day, and after the initial Navy investigations into the detection, the productions"
"and the arrested persons have been handed over to the Kankesanturai police."
"It was the evidence of the witness that all the relevant productions were sealed"
"by him following the due procedure, at the time of the arrest of the appellants."
"At  the  trial,  the  PW-01  has  marked  a  map  of  the  area  of  detection  as  P-01,"
"where  the  movements  of  the  two  vessels  arrested  have  been  shown  using  the"
"GPS positional signal information obtained from the two GPS devises found. He"
"has  marked  and  produced  all  the  relevant  productions  recovered  by  him,"
"including the parcels of Heroin, which has been marked as P-21 to P-24. It is"
"clear  from  the  evidence  that  the  weighing  of  the  Heroin  had  been  done  at  the"
"Kankesanturai police station. The parcel marked P-21 has had a total weight of"
"506  grams  and  the  parcel  marked  P-22  has  had  a  total  weight  of  510  grams,"
