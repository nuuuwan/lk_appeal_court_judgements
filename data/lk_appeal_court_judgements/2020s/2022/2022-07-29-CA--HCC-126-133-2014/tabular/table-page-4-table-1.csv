"The facts in brief: -"
"On  28th  November  2011  Lieutenant  Commander  Charitha  Gunawantha  (PW-"
"01)  was  functioning  as  the  Commanding  Officer  of  the  Sri  Lanka  Navy  fast"
"attack craft P.480, which was on surveillance duty in the northern seas of Sri"
"Lanka between Mannar and Delft Island within the maritime boundary line of"
"the country."
"At  around  21.10  hours,  he  and  his  officers  have  noticed  the  movements  of  a"
"suspicious dingy boat through the radar facility of their vessel. At that time the"
"dingy boat was around two nautical miles away from them. Using the onboard"
"night  vision  camera  they  have  continued  to  observe  the  boat  while  getting"
"closer  to  it.  They  have  switched  off  the  lights  of  Navy  vessel  in  order  to  avoid"
"their movements being detected. In his evidence the PW-01 has well explained"
"the  reasons  for  the  suspicions  of  the  movements  of  the  dingy  boat  and  the"
"facilities  his  vessel  had  to  closely  observe  the  movements  of  the  boat  and  the"
"methods  they  used  to  avoid  detection  of  their  presence.    There  were  no  other"
"fishing  boats  of  this  nature  in  the  vicinity  of  the  dingy  they  observed.  There"
"were  several  Indian  fishing  vessels  engaging  in  illegal  fishing  in  the  territorial"
"waters of the country at that time, which were some distance away."
"They  have  then  observed  one  Indian  Fishing  vessel  braking  away  from  the"
"group  of  Indian  vessels  and  approaching  the  dingy  boat  they  were  observing"
"and  coming  parallel  to  it.  He  has  then  seen  a  person  from  the  Indian  vessel"
"handing over a parcel to one of the persons who were on board the dingy boat."
"There were three persons in the dingy boat, while he has observed four persons"
"in the Indian vessel. Upon seeing this PW-01 had immediately approached the"
"vessels  after  switching  on  the  onboard  flash  lights  and  warning  them  to  stop."
"While  getting  closer  to  the  dingy  boat,  he  has  observed  the  person  who  was"
"seated near the outboard motor engine of the dingy biting open one parcel, and"
"throwing it into the sea. Immediately thereafter, two officers have boarded the"
"dingy while one officer has recovered the parcel which was thrown into the sea."
