"The 
learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submitted  that  the  2nd"
"Respondent had failed to take into consideration the aforementioned facts and"
"circumstances when he made the determination marked X6."
"It  was  submitted  on  behalf  of  the  Petitioner  that  the  1st  and/or  the  2nd"
"Respondents have not made any determination on the Petitioner’s stance. The"
"learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the determination"
"contained  in  the  letter  marked  X6  does  not  make  any  determination  on  the"
"stance advanced by the Petitioner at the relevant inquiry and does not make any"
"determination as to whether the Petitioner in the circumstances pertaining to"
"the employment of the 3rd Respondent during the relevant period was liable to"
"make contributions under the Act No. 15 of 1958 (as amended) and if so, to what"
"extent."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the Petitioner has  also submitted  that  in"
"making  a  determination  of  the  3rd  Respondent’s  claim,  the  1st  and/or  the  2nd"
"Respondents  have  taken 
into  consideration  irrelevant  matters  and  hearsay"
"evidence.  In  the  letter  marked  1R1,  written  by  one  Mr.  Subasinghe  who  was"
"another  employee  of  the  Petitioner,  Mr.  Subasinghe  has  stated  that  the  3rd"
"Respondent of  this case had not agreed to  accept an increase in his monthly"
"wages 
in 
lieu  of  making  contributions  to  the  relevant  EPF  and  ETF  funds."
"Therefore, it is the submission of the learned President’s Counsel that when one"
"considers the entirety of the matters pleaded in paragraph 11 of the Statement"
"of  Objections  of  the  1st,  2nd  and  4th  Respondents,  it  is  clear  that  in  making  a"
"determination  of  the  claim  the  1st  and/or  2nd  Respondents  have  taken  into"
"account the matters stated by the said Subasinghe in the letter marked 1R1."
