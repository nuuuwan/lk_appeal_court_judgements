"statute being superior reflects the will of the legislature and takes priority over"
"a private arrangement. In that case the Petitioner sought to quash the licenses"
"issued by the Minister of Power and Energy under the provisions of Act no. 33"
"of 2002 to the 4th and 5th Respondents. A CUF agreement was entered among"
"the Petitioner, 1st Respondent, 3rd Respondent and the Secretary to the Treasury"
"acting for and on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka. The government had in"
"terms  of  the  CUF  agreement  covenanted,  promised  and  undertaken  that  all"
"bunkers/  marine  fuel  handled  and  transported  within  the  Port  of  Colombo"
"should be handled and transported using the CUF. Siripavan J held that as the"
"impugned licenses were issued in terms of the provisions contained in section 5"
"of the Act no. 33 of 2002 the powers of the Minister as contained in  the Act"
"cannot be taken away by the CUF agreement. The statute being superior reflects"
"the will of the legislature and takes priority over the CUF agreement. The ratio"
"decidendi in that case applies to this case as well and therefore the statutory"
"obligations  imposed  by  Employees’  Provident  Fund  Act  no.  15  of  1958  (as"
"amended)  on  the  employer  cannot  be  waived  off  by  any  private  agreement"
"between  the  employer  and  the  employee.  The  statute  being  superior  takes"
"priority over such private agreement. Therefore, the Petitioner company is liable"
"to contribute to the EPF and ETF for the services rendered by the 3rd Respondent"
"and  the  2nd  Respondent  has  come  to  a  correct  conclusion  in  respect  of  that"
"matter."
"Therefore, the Petitioner cannot complain that the decision marked X6 is illegal,"
"ultra vires and contrary to the principles of natural justice."
"The Petitioner states that the decision of the 2nd Respondent marked X6 is in"
"clear  contravention  of  the  Petitioner’s  statutory  rights  and  in  excess  of  the"
"power of the 2nd Respondent. Section 28 of the Act No. 15 of 1958 (as amended)"
"reads as follows:-"
"“All claims to benefits shall be determined by the Commissioner or by any officer"
"authorized in that behalf by him and the determination of the Commissioner or"
"such  officer  shall,  subject  to  any  decision  on  an  appeal  made  against  such"
"determination in accordance with the provisions of this Act, be final.”"
"Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  Section  28  of  the  Act  expressly  recognizes  that  any"
"determination  made  by  the  Commissioner  is  subject  to  any  decision  on  an"
"appeal made against such determination."
