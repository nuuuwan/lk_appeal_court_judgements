"National Institute of Education on the Petitioner is reflected in the statement of account R10."
"Thus,   the   said   expenditure   had   been   borne   out   by   the   National   Institute   of   Education.   The"
"Institution has expanded this amount to educate and qualify its employees so that the ultimate"
"beneficiary would be the State at large."
"When a recipient abruptly abandons the education program, to prevent the loss that it would"
"cause,   a   clause   is   inserted   in   the   agreement.   Exceptions   to   this   are   the   instances   that   are"
"contained   in   clause   8   (b)  and   11   namely   the   recipient   falling   ill   or  the   deterioration   of  the"
"recipientâ€™s   health.   Therefore,   the   party   who   is   seeking   the   cover   of   the   said   clauses   should"
"strictly comply with the provisions of the contract that enable the said clauses to be triggered."
"At the argument stage this Court posed the question to the Counsel for the Petitioner and asked"
"whether an application has been made in compliance with these clauses and the learned Counsels"
"answer to this Court was in the negative."
"In   the   above   circumstances   this   Court   observes   that   for   the   Petitioner   to   succeed   in   his"
"application to obtain relief from the contract he must first comply himself with the provisions of"
"the contract."
"After considering all the facts and the legal submissions made before this Court, for the reasons"
"set out in this Judgment we are of the view that the Petitioner has failed to establish his right to"
"pursue and obtain a public law remedy."
"Accordingly, we are not inclined to grant the reliefs prayed for in the petition. This application is"
"dismissed without cost."
