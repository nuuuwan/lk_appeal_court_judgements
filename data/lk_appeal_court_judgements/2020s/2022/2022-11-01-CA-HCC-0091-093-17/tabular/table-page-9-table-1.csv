"The  most  decisive  pieces  of  evidence  that  had  led  to  the  conviction  of  all  three  accused-"
"appellants had been the evidence relating to establishing the identity of the third accused-"
"appellant at the scene of the crime. Counsel for the first and the second accused-appellants"
"is of the view that only PW8 had seen a pistol falling off the third accused-appellant while he"
"was escaping and his evidence on this fact and the identity of the third accused-appellant had"
"been a concocted story to fix his culpability and the other two accused-appellants. It is indeed"
"unconvincing how no other police officers, eyewitnesses or the other members of the public"
"gathered  in  their  twenties  and  thirties  at  the  crime  scene  had  seen  the  third  accused-"
"appellant escape through the roof and how PW 8 had failed to inform others about what he"
"had witnessed at that point in order to take steps to take the third accused-appellant into"
"custody."
"In  his  testimony,  PW  8  had  stated  that  he  had  been  able  to  identify  the  third  accused-"
"appellant who was on the roof with the aid of lights that emanated from nearby houses and"
"the moonlight and thus it is intelligible that identification of the said accused-appellant had"
"been  somewhat  difficult.  In  such  a  situation,  to  arrive  at  a  conclusive  decision  as  regards"
"identification, it would have been appropriate to follow specific guidelines. The English Court"
"of Appeal in R Vs Turnbull l (C.A.), [1977] 1 Q.B. 224 at 228 prescribed rules to guide Judges"
"faced  with  contested  visual  identification  evidence.  It  had  been  held  that  a  Judge  should"
"examine  closely the  circumstances  in  which  the identification  by each  witness  came  to be"
"made. This may include asking themselves questions such as:"
"How long did the witness have the accused under observation? At what distance?  In what"
"light?"
"Was the observation impeded in any way e.g. by traffic or other people?"
"Had the witness ever seen the accused before? If so, how often?"
"If only occasionally, had he any special reason for remembering the accused?"
"How long had elapsed between the original observation and the subsequent identification to"
"the police?"
"Was there any material discrepancy between the description given by the witness and the"
"actual appearance of the accused?"
"The  importance  of  these  guidelines  has  been  reiterated  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  SC  (Spl)"
