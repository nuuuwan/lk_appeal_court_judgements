"court by the accused-appellants."
"Grounds of appeal raised by the first and the second accused-appellants are as follows:"
"1.  Evidence of the police witnesses (PW 5 and PW 8) were contradictory with that of the"
"lay witnesses (PW 1, PW 3 and PW 4) as to the number of suspects arrested at the"
"scene of crime."
"2.  Nothing had been recovered from the possession of the accused-appellants although"
"they were arrested at the scene."
"3.  The  learned  Judge  of  the  High  Court  had  failed  to  consider  and  evaluate  the  dock"
"statements."
"4.  There had been no proper identification of the accused-appellants by the witnesses"
"and their identification amounts to a dock identification."
"5.  Only  PW8  had  seen  a  pistol  falling  off  the  third  accused-appellant  while  he  was"
"escaping and his evidence on this fact and the identity of the third accused-appellant"
"is a concocted story to fix his culpability."
"6.  The third accused-appellant was never arrested at the crime scene and therefore, it"
"had not been proved that the first and the second accused-appellants had a common"
"intention with him."
