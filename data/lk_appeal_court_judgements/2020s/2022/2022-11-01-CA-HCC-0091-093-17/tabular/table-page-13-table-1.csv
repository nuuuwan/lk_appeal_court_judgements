"be  proved  that  the  third  accused-appellant  had  used  the  firearm  in  the  commission  of  an"
"offence specified in schedule C."
"Section 44A of the Firearms (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1996 states the following:"
"'Notwithstanding anything in this Ordinance or any other law, any person who uses a gun in"
"the commission of an offence specified in Schedule c of this Ordinance shall be punished on"
"conviction for the such offence with death or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to"
"a fine not exceeding twenty thousand rupees.'"
"The prosecution had failed to link any offence specified in schedule c of the said Act with the"
"use  of  the  firearm  by  the  third  accused-appellant  with  compelling  evidence.  The  third"
"accused-appellant had been indicted and convicted for committing the offence of robbery"
"punishable under section 380 of the penal code the elements of which, the prosecution yet"
"again  had  failed  to  prove  beyond  reasonable  doubt  for  want  of  precise  and  unambiguous"
"evidence. As a result, any conviction under the above act is deemed untenable."
"The issues raised above indicate that the prosecution had no strong prima facie case due to a"
"lack  of  unequivocal  evidence  that  proved  the  commission  of  the  offences  of  which  the"
"accused-appellants  had  been  convicted.  Hence,  this  Court  sets  aside  the  above  judgment"
"delivered by the learned Judge of the High Court and acquits all three accused-appellants of"
"all charges."
"Appeal allowed."
