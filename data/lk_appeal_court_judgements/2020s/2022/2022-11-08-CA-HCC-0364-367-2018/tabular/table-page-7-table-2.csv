"in some cases to say that it is a case of murder and therefore, it is desirable"
"that there must also be medical testimony.‚Äù"
"In the case under consideration, the doctor who performed the postmortem on"
"the  deceased  has  failed  to  give  a  definite  finding  as  to  whether  the  injuries"
"suffered by the deceased are fatal in the ordinary course of nature. Considering"
"the fact that the three cut injuries found on the body of the deceased have been"
"to  the  hand  and  the  right  thigh,  the  trial  Court  would  not  be  in  a  position  to"
"determine that fact without being supported by medical evidence."
"Accordingly,  I  find  merit  in  the  first  ground  of  appeal  urged  by  the  learned"
"Counsel."
"However, it was the contention of the learned Counsel that the evidence adduced"
"before the trial Court has provided a sufficient basis for the learned trial Judge"
"to consider whether there was a sudden fight which resulted the deceased and"
"the others being injured in evaluating evidence. It is the view of this Court that"
"even  if  the  accused  party  denies  any  involvement  in  the  commission  of  the"
"offence,  it  is  the  duty  of  the  learned  trial  Judge  to  consider  that  fact  and"
"determine accordingly."
