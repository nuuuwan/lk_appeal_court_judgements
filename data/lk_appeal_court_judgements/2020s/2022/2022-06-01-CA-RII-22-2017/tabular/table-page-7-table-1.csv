"sometime before 27.01.2015. The case record is unable to give an exact date"
"of service of the decree nisi. It must be noted that the correct Journal Entry"
"No. 05 does not give a date under 27.01.2015, or a date on which papers"
"were received. Therefore it is not possible to conclude that the deed No. 1489"
"dated 22.01.2015 in favour of the petitioner is a nullity. The benefit of any"
"doubt must go to the petitioner. It was said in Alan Wibberley Building Ltd."
"vs.   Insley   (1999)  by   Lord   Hoffman   that   “Oral   evidence   will   never   be"
"admitted to contradict the contents of a deed”."
"Therefore, this court holds that the petitioner has locus standi to have and"
"maintain the present application."
