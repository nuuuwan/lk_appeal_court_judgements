"immunity on the President from suit, it is obvious that the Petitioner is not challenging"
"any decision of His Excellency the President and also that he has not made the President"
"a party in the instant application. The Article 35 (which was in the 19th Amendment) of"
"the Constitution has been repealed and a new Article 35 has been substituted by the 20th"
"Amendment (certified on 29.10.2020). However, no change has been made to the proviso"
"to Article 35(1) of the Constitution by which it emphasizes the right of any person to make"
"an application under Article 126 against the Attorney General in respect of anything done"
"or omitted to be done by the President in his official capacity. In that context, I need not"
"examine  at  this  stage  whether  the  proper  course  of  action  for  the  Petitioner  is  to  file  a"
"fundamental  rights  application  in  the  Supreme  Court  against  the  Attorney  General  in"
"respect of any infringement of his fundamental rights based on the issues raised by him in"
"this Court."
"Undoubtedly  this  Court  has  no  jurisdiction  to  entertain  any  application  against  the"
"President in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the President either in his"
"official  or  private  capacity.  However,  such  notion  does  not  preclude  this  Court  from"
"examining the decision making process of the authorities who exercise delegated powers"
"prior to the President disposing of a State land by way of a permit/grant/lease. The crucial"
"question that this Court should take in to consideration is whether the final determination"
"of this Court in the instant application would negate any act done or omitted to be done"
"by the President. In an event if this Court decides that there is a procedural error in the"
"decision making process of the authorities relevant to this application, it is up to the Head"
"of the State to take such determination in to consideration or not. However, if the Supreme"
"Court issues an order in an application filed under Article 126 of the Constitution based"
"on the similar issues as such, the situation would have been different. The Petitioner for"
"the  reasons  not  known  to  Court  has  decided  to  recourse  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  in"
"challenging the relevant decision making process and the Petitioner should be advised by"
"himself as to whatâ€™s the best forum available for him to get his grievances resolved."
"In the light of the above reasons, I am not inclined to accept the proposition of the learned"
"State Counsel and of the learned Counsel for the 7th Respondent that a writ of Certiorari"
"should not be issued when the end result will be futile. The said Respondents in this regard"
"rely on the judgment of Ratnasiri and others vs. Ellawala and others (2004) 2 SLR 180."
"I  take  the  view  that  the  final  determination  of this  case  cannot  be  futile  as  the  relevant"
"authorities  or  the  Head  of  the  State,  as  I  have  mentioned  above,  has  the  option  of"
"remedying any errors, if any, in future."
