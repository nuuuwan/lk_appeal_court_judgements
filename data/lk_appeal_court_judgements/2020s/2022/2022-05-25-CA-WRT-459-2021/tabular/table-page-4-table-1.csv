"(Investigations) of the State Ministry of Home Affairs. Therefore, it is apparent that the"
"Petitioner is not challenging any decision of the President by way of a writ of Certiorari."
"Since  this  Court  has  not  yet  taken  a  decision  on  issuance  of  Notice  of  this  case  on  the"
"Respondents, I do not wish to comment at this stage whether the Notice could be issued"
"on  the  Respondents  based  on  the  other  reliefs  sought  by  the  Petitioner  for  writs  of"
"Mandamus and for a writ of Prohibition."
"The lease bearing No. 4/10/14925 marked ‘P2(b)’ upon which an amendment is being"
"sort by the Petitioner, has been issued in terms of the State Lands Ordinance. The 23 page"
"report  dated  06.09.2021  marked  ‘P28(c)’  which  is  one  of  the  impugned  documents,"
"elaborates  very  well  that  so  many  decisions  of  public  officers  are  involved  during  the"
"process of leasing out a State land. In terms of Section 2 of the State Lands Ordinance, the"
"President has the sole authority to grant leases and other dispositions of State land. The"
"said section 2 itself clearly stipulates that the President may enter in to an agreement for"
"sale, lease or other disposition of the State lands subjected to the provisions of the said"
"Ordinance and to the Regulations made thereunder. It is evident as per ‘P28(c)’ that the"
"Divisional  Secretary,  Land  Commissioner,  Surveyor  General  and  several  other  public"
"officers  contribute  in  their  respective  official  capacities  before  taking  a  final  decision  to"
"recommend to the President that a portion of State land be disposed by way of a lease."
"I am very much mindful of the fact that a villager or a farmer in a remote area goes through"
"hardships due to the tedious procedure in obtaining a land permit, a grant or a lease upon"
"State  land.  They  may  not  have  the  privilege  of  having  direct  contacts  to  the  President."
"Further, this Court being a supervisory Court in this country cannot possibly overlook the"
"fact  that  some  public  officers  solicit  or  accept  gratifications  to  perform  or  abstain  from"
"performing  any  official  acts  during  such  a  long  process.  Generally,  after  following  the"
"procedure prescribed by the written law and its regulations, a final recommendation would"
"be made to the President by the relevant officers after a long period of time. Also, the Court"
"needs to take in to account the instances where under exceptional circumstances or under"
"incomprehensible  circumstances,  the  State  lands  are  being  disposed  by  way  of  permits,"
"grants or by way of lease without following the due process. In this event, I am of the view,"
"a citizen should have a right to challenge the decision making process  up to the instant"
"where the President exercises his powers under the law upon State land."
"Though the learned SC asserts that this Court is suffering from patent and total want of"
"jurisdiction in terms of the said Article 35 of the Constitution which confers Constitutional"
