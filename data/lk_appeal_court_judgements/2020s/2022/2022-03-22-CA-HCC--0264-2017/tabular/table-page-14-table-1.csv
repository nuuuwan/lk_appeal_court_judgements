"PW4 in his evidence stated that the place of recovery was covered by trees"
"and the items were recovered from a place like a hollow covered by bamboo"
"trees.  The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in  her  judgement  mentioned  this  as"
"recovery  was  done  in  a  hollow  of  a  tree.  She  has  only  omitted  to  mention"
"about the bamboo tree. According to PW4 the place where the recovery was"
"made  was  only  covered  with  bamboo.  Hence,  omitting  to  mention  bamboo"
"tree in the judgment is not a serious misdirection as argued by the Appellant."
