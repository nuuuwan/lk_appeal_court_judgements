"The investigating team recovered a trouser, a brassiere, a blouse, a pair of"
"slippers and an undergarment from under a bamboo bush."
"The Appellant was arrested on 08/10/2010 at Gonapola close to Piliyandala"
"town. He was arrested at 5.10 p.m. His statement was recorded immediately"
"at Gonapola and recovered certain items pertaining to the crime. Answering"
"to  the  court  PW4  had  explained  why  he  recorded  the  statement  of  the"
"Appellant immediately after the arrest. Vide page 139-140 of the brief. Hence"
"it is incorrect to say that the police had the prior knowledge about the clothes"
"of the deceased."
"The  Appellant  further  contends  that  as  the  recovery  had  been  made  after"
"about 05 months of the crime, and there is a reasonable doubt as to whether"
"the clothes which were uncovered, unprotected would have been there even"
"after 05 months."
"The recovery was made after the arrest of the Appellant. If not for the arrest"
"of the Appellant the police could not have recovered anything related to the"
"crime. The truth regarding the dress of the deceased only surfaced upon the"
"statement  he  made  to  the  police  upon  his  arrest.  Had  the  Appellant  not"
"provided this information, the police could not have recovered these items."
"Also  contends  that  even  though  the  recovery  was  made  under  a  bamboo"
"bush,  the  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in  his  judgment  had  stated  that  the"
"recovery was made in the hollow of a tree. He further contends that due to"
"above misdirection the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider whether"
"it  was  probable  to  believe  that  the  clothes  were  recovered  even  after  05"
"months."
