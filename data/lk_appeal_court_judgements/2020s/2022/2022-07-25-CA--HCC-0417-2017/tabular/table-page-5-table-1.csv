"","premises.  He  has  got  down  from  the  vehicle  and"
"","managed to arrest one person who is the appellant."
"","The  appellant  has  been  running  from  the  Court"
"","premises  towards  the  direction  of  Moratuwa.  At"
"","that point in time, a woman has informed him that"
"","her  brother  was  stabbed.  When  he  arrested  the"
"","appellant,  he  has  had  a  knife  in  his  possession"
"","which was taken as a production."
"6.","It has been evident that the PW1 has not attended"
"","court  to  participate  in  the  identification  parade  as"
"","a  witness 
to 
identify 
the 
suspects  who  were"
"","produced  before 
the  Magistrate  Court.  Further,"
"","PW1 has not attended the Magistrate Court for the"
"","non-summary  proceedings.  Her  evidence  was  that"
"","she  has  been  in  hiding,  due  to  the  fear  of  death"

"","involved 
in 
the  murder  of 
the  deceased.  The"

"","therefore,  identification  of  the  appellant  from  the"
"","dock  at  the  trial  cannot  be  considered  as  proper"
"","identification  of 
the  appellant, 
to  safely  convict"
"","him.  It  is  the  contention  of  the  learned  Deputy"
"","Solicitor  General 
for 
the 
respondent 
that 
the"
"","appellant has been properly identified as one of the"
"","assailants,  as  the  appellant  was  arrested  by  the"
"","police  officer  immediately  after  the  incident,  when"
"","the  appellant  was  running  away  with  the  other"
"","assailants."
"8.","The  eye  witness  to  the  incident  PW1,  has  failed  to"
"","appear 
in 
the 
Magistrate 
Court 
for 
the"
"","identification  parade  where 
the  appellant  was"
"","produced  as  a  suspect.  The  explanation  she  has"
