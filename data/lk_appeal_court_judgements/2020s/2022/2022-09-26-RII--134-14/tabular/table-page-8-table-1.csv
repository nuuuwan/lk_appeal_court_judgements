"personally present the notice of appeal and sign the petition of appeal when the registered"
"attorney was on record. It is my considered view that a party appellant is entitled to"
"present and sign the relevant notice and petition of appeal respectively, only when there"
"is no registered attorney on record at the time tendering the notice of appeal and petition"
"o
f
 
appeal.”"
"His Lordship cited with approval a passage from the judgment in Seelawathie v."
"Jayasinghe [1985] 2 SLR 266 in which his Lordship Seneviratne J. held:"
"“When a party to a case has an attorney-at-law on record, it is the attorney-at-law"
"on record alone, who must take steps, and also whom the Court permits to take steps. It"
"is a recognised principle in Court proceedings that when there is an attorney-at-law"
"appointed by a party, such party must take all steps in the case through such attorney-"
"at-law. Further, the principle established in a court is that if a party is represented by an"
"attorney-at-law such a party himself is not permitted to address Court. All the"
"submissions of the party must be made through the Attorney-at-law who represents such"
"a
 
party.”"
"This  was  made  clear  by  his  Lordship  Dr.  Amerasinghe  J.  in  Fernando  v.  Sybil"
"Fernando [1997] 3 SLR 1:"
"“A litigant has a statutory right to act for himself unless the law provides"
"otherwise: (section 24 CPC). Therefore, there is no difficulty in understanding why, in"
"section 755 (1), it is stated that a notice of appeal may be signed by the appellant or his"
"registered attorney: if he had been acting for himself at the trial, he may himself sign the"
"notice of appeal. A litigant may, however, elect to act through a registered Attorney-at-"
"Law. If he elects to act through a registered Attorney-at-Law, he must formally appoint"
"such an attorney in writing and file the instrument of such appointment in court: (section"
"27(1) (CPC). When so filed, such an instrument shall be in force, unless revoked, or until"
"the'' client or registered attorney dies or becomes incapable to act or until all proceedings"
"in the action are ended and judgment satisfied so far as regards the client: (section 27 (2)"
"CPC)."
"So long as such an instrument of the appointment of a registered Attorney-at-Law is in"
"f
orce, a litigant who has executed such an instrument must act through his registered"
"attorney until all proceedings in the action are ended and judgment satisfied so far as"
"regards that litigant: While the proxy is in force, he cannot himself perform any act in"
"court relating to the proceedings of the action:” [emphasis added]"
