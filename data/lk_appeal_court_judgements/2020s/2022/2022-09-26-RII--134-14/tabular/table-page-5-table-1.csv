"On  the  day  in  question,  the  Journal  Entry  notes  that  the  Registered  Attorney"
"appeared  on  behalf  of  the  1st  Defendant.  However,  the  Registered  Attorney  informed"
"Court she had no instructions. The Journal Entry reads:"
"“1 වන විත්තිකරු උපදෙස් දනොමැි බව නීතී.  ගංගො මිය කියො සිටී. 1,2 විත්ති නැත."

"The term “appear” must be interpreted to mean an appearance by the Registered"
"Attorney of the 1st Defendant.  As a result, the appearance of the Registered Attorney for"
"the  1st  Defendant  alone  in  the  absence  of  the  1st  Defendant  itself  constituted  a  valid"
"appearance. This is buttressed by the following line of authorities:"
"In  Perumal  Chetty  v  A.  Goonetilleke  4  Balasingham’s  Reports  2,  his  Lordship"
"Hutchinson C.J. treated an appearance of the Proctor as the appearance of the Defendant."
"In Cannon v. Telesinghe 30 NLR 372 his Lordship Akbar J. held:"
"“Prima facie, therefore, the words “the defendant shall not appear or sufficiently excuse"
"h
is absence” can only mean the defendant shall not appear in person or by Proctor or"
"sufficiently excuse his absence when he does not so appear."
"Mr. Ranawaka, however, referred me to a case reported in 3 Browne’s Reports 1. It is true"
"that Browne A.J. construed the word “appearance” as meaning “being personally present,”"
"but it will be seen from his judgment that his remarks are really obiter. I, therefore, prefer"
"to follow the later judgment of Hutchinson C.J. reported in 4 Balasingham’s Reports 2,"
"where he expressly held the contrary.”"
"In Alima Umma v. Siyaneris [2006] 1 SLR 22, his Lordship Amaratunga J. held:"
"“In terms of Section 24 of the Civil Procedure Code, the registered attorney or an attorney"
"at law instructed by the registered attorney can represent a party to the action in Court."
"If the registered attorney is in Court and represents the party in Court, that is an"
"appearance for the party even if the party is not physically present in Court. Andiappa"
