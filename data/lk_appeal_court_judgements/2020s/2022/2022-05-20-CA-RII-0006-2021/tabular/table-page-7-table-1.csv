"His Lordship Drieberg J. in Phipps v. Bracegyrdle 35 NLR 302, held that in such"
"cases, “it could be said in reality that there was no consent”. His Lordship also observed,"
"“On the same principle I can understand, though there is no reported case on the point,"
"relief being granted on the ground that both parties have agreed to a settlement under a"
"m
i
stake of fact, for as in the case of contract the element of consensus would be absent.”"
"I
n Perera v. Don Simon 62 NLR 118 His Lordship Sansoni J. (as he then was) held,"
"“Restitutio in integrum can be claimed on the ground of Justus error, which I understand"
"to connote reasonable or excusable error. I am unable to see that such a ground exists in"
"this case. It is, on the contrary, an example of damage arising from carelessness or"
"negligence.”"
"Their Lordships of the Supreme Court in Mudiyanse v. Bandulahamy [1989] 2 SLR"
"383, very clearly pronounced that unless the mistake qualifies as a “justus error” a mere"
"mistake will not suffice for the grant of restitutio in intergrum."
"T
heir Lordships referred the judgment of Cornelius Perera v. Leo Perera in which"
"case His Lordship Sansoni J. (as he then was) made the following observation,"
"“Now the Roman Dutch Law enables a person to avoid an agreement for mistake"
"on his part when the mistake is an essential and reasonable one. It must be essential in"
"the sense that there was a mistake as to the person with whom he was dealing (error in"
"persona) or as to the nature or subject matter of the transaction (error in negotio, error in"
"corpore). A mistake in regard to incidental matters is not enough. The test of"
"reasonableness is satisfied if the person shows either (1) that the error was induced by"
"the fraudulent or innocent misrepresentation of the other party, or (2) that the other party"
"knew, or a reasonable person should have known, that a mistake was being made, or (3)"
"that the mistake was, in all the circumstances, excusable (Justus et probabilis error) even"
"where there was absence of misrepresentation or knowledge on the part of the other party."
"An agreement entered into in the course of an action, like any other agreement, may be"
"set aside on these grounds.”"
"I
n the light of the foregoing authorities, this Court must now consider whether the"
"mistake that is pleaded in the instant case qualifies as a “justus error”."
