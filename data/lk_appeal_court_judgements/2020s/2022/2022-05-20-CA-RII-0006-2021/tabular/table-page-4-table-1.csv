"Rasmi,  Licensed  Surveyor,  was  filed  of  record.  Both  Commissioners  have  relied  on  the"
"said Plan bearing No. 337 which is the subject matter of this case."
"T
he trial commenced with the recording of admissions and issues whereupon the"
"2nd  Plaintiff  gave  evidence.  During  the said  evidence  the  parties  agreed  to  enter  into  a"
"settlement and the terms of settlement were recorded in Court on 17.07.2020. The parties"
"agreed to settle upon the boundaries shown in the commission plan of Mr. M.L.M. Rasmi,"
"Licensed Surveyor, bearing plan No. 5243."
"A
fter the said terms of settlement were entered the Plaintiff filed the settlement"
"decree and also obtained a writ to execute the said terms of settlement for the purpose of"
"demarcating the boundaries as per the commission plan bearing No. 5243. When the said"
"writ was executed for the purpose of demarcating the boundaries, the Defendant observed"
"a severe disparity in the boundaries shown in the final scheme of partition bearing No.337"
"and the Commission plan bearing No. 5243 and objected to demarcating the boundaries"
"as  per  the  terms  of  settlement  entered.  He  then  questioned  the  Surveyor Mr.  M.L.M."
"Rasmi as to this disparity. Mr. Rasmi had reported the disparity to Court by the letter"
"dated  03.02.2021,  which  has  been  minuted  in  the  journal  entry  bearing  No.  35  dated"
"05.02.2021. Thereafter, the Defendant caused to check the case record and discovered that"
"the  Plaintiff  had  submitted  a  subsequent  traced  copy  of  the  final  scheme  of  partition"
"bearing No.337 which has been fraudulently or mistakenly certified by the said Licensed"
"Surveyor with incorrect and /or wrong boundaries. The Defendant avers that the said two"
"plans have obvious and visible differences, especially with regard to Lots No. 2,3, and 4"
"which are the disputed boundaries of the case before the District Court."
"I
t is alleged that due to this error and/or fraud the said terms of settlement entered"
"between the parties cannot stand in the eyes of the law and is prejudicial to the Defendant."
"On this basis, the Defendant pleads for it to be set aside by application of restitutio in"
"integrum."
"W
hen  the  matter  was  argued  before  this  Court  on  03.03.  2022,  the  Defendant"
"produced both plans to demonstrate this disparity between the original plan and the plan"
"submitted by the Plaintiff with regard to the Lots."
