"","","“The court is often called upon to decide whether a written contract falls"
"","","within a particular legal description. In so doing, the court will identify the"
"","","rights  and  obligations  of  the  parties  as  a  matter  of  construction  of  the"

it  will 
then  go  on","to  consider  whether 
those"
"","","obligations fall within the relevant legal description. Thus the question may"
"","","be whether those rights and obligations are properly characterised as a"
"","","licence or tenancy (as in Street v. Mountford [1985] AC 809); or as a fixed"
"","","or floating charge (as in Agnew v. IRC [2001] 2 AC 710), or as a consumer"
"","","hire agreement (as in TRM Copy Centres (UK) Ltd v. Lanwall Services Ltd"

"","","“A court of justice in construing a document should have less regard to its"

"","","the court will not consider the mere name given to a transaction, but will"
"","","rather  see  what  the  transaction  really  is  in  truth  and  in  fact  upon  a"
"","","consideration of all the facts relating to it. The rule that the real intention is"
"","","to be preferred to the ordinary meaning of words where such intention is"
