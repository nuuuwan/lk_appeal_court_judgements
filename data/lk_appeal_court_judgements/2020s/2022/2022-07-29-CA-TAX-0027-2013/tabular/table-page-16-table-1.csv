"Is the Appellant a “Travel Agent” under the agreement?"
"[36] The next question is to decide whether or not the Appellant acted as a"
"travel  agent  or  a  handling  agent  in  terms  of  the  Agreement  entered  into"
"between the Appellant and the SriLankan Airlines Ltd. As the parties sought"
"to  interpret  the  term  “handling  agent”    used  in  the  Agreement  in  different"
"manner,   the Court must first find out the true meaning and the substance of"
"the  transaction  and  the  way  in  which  the  Appellant  carried  on  business  in"
"terms of the Agreement."
"[37]  When  determining  the    true  nature  and  substance  of  the  relationship"
"between 
the  parties  and 
the  characterisation  of 
the 
relationship, 
it 
is"
"necessary to consider the proper approach to be adopted in interpreting the"
"true meaning of  the  Agreement.   It  is relevant  to note    that  certain  rules of"
"interpretation  have  been 
formulated  with  a  view 
to  guide 
the  Court 
in"
"interpreting  the  true  meaning  and  the  substance  of  the  Agreement  in  any"
"commercial Agreement such as the one we are concerned."
"General Rule- Textualism"
"[38]  The  general  rule  in  interpreting  any  written  agreement  or  a  text  is  to"
"understand and give full weight to the language used in its grammatical and"
"ordinary sense, so as to give the written agreement or a text a commercial"
"certainty  and  sensible  meaning  to  the  language  used  in  its  ordinary  and"
"grammatical sense. This ordinarily means that the words must prima facie be"
"taken to have been used in their ordinary and grammatical sense. The general"
"rule 
in 
  construing  wills,  statutes  and  written 
instruments 
is 
that 
the"
"grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless the"
"words would lead to some absurdity, or some repugnance or inconsistency"
"with the rest of the instrument.  In such case, the grammatical and ordinary"
"sense  of 
the  words  may  be  modified  so  as 
to  avoid 
that  absurdity  or"
"inconsistency, but no further” [Grey v. Pearson (1857) 6 H.L. Cas. 61 at 1060]."
"Thus, where the words used are free of ambiguity and devoid of commercial"
"absurdity,  their  natural and ordinary  meaning  will apply  unless  the  relevant"
"surrounding  circumstances  demonstrate  otherwise 
[Bank  of  Credit  and"
"Commerce International SA v. Ali (2002) 1 AC 251, para 20]."
"From text to Context - contextualism"
"[39] There has been a clear development over the last two or three decades,"
"however, 
in  both  statutory  and  contractual 
interpretation 
from  a 
literal"
"approach 
to  a  purposive  approach  viz, 
from 
text 
to  context  (see-  J.  U"
"Spigelman “From Text to Context: Contemporary Contractual Interpretation”"
"(2007)  81  Australian  Law  Journal  322  www.lawlink.nsw.gov.su/sc  under"
