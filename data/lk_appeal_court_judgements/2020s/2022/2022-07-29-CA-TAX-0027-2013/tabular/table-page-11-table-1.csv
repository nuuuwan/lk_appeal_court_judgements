"to have come to this conclusion on the erroneous interpretation of the definition"
"of  the  phrase  “Sri  Lankan  Layover  Programme”  that  it  only  covers  “transit"
"passengers”."
"[22] It is relevant to note, however, that the definition section of the Agreement"
"indicates  that  those  definitions  apply  except  where  the  context  otherwise"
"required. It reads as follows:"
"“In  this  Agreement,  including  the  Recitals,  Schedules  and  Appendices"
"hereto, except where the context otherwise requires to-”"
"[23]  The  word  ""in 
this  Agreement, 
...except  where 
the  context  otherwise"
"requires 
to""  would 
indicate 
that the  definitions,  which  are 
indicated 
to  be"
"conclusive may not be treated to be conclusive if it was otherwise required by"
"the  context.  The  TAc  took  a  very  restrictive  approach  to  the  word  “include”"
"to  mean 
that 
it 
is 
used 
in 
the  definition  “SriLankan  Layover  Programme”"
"restricted  to  transit  passengers  travelling  via  Sri  Lanka.  The  word  ""includes"""
"has, however, different meanings in different contexts. For example, Standard"
"dictionaries  assign  more  than  one  meaning  to  the  word  ""include"".  Webster's"
"Dictionary  defines 
the  word  ""include""  as  synonymous  with  ""comprise""  or"
"""contain"". According to Black’s Law  Dictionary, Revised ed. p. 905, the word"
"“including” may, according to context, is express an enlargement and have the"
"meaning of and, or in addition to, or merely specify a particular thing already"
"included within general words therefore used."
"[24]  It  is  well-settled  that  when  the  interpretation  clause  used  an  inclusive"
"definition, it would be generally expansive in nature and thus, it seeks to enlarge"
"the meaning of the words or phrases used in an interpretation clause, unless it"
"manifests  a  contrary  intention  very  clearly  (P.  M.  Bakshi,  Interpretation  of"
"Statutes,  First  Edition,  2008,  pp.  242-243).  In  such  case,  the  word  “include”"
"must  be  construed  as  comprehending,  not  only  such  things  as  they  signify"
"according to their natural import, but also those things which the interpretation"
"clause  declares 
that 
they  shall 
include 
(Commissioner  of 
Inland  Tax  v."
"Banddarawathie  Fernando  Charitable  Trusts  (63  N.L.R  409).  It  is  true  that"
"generally, when the word ""include"" is used in a definition clause, it is used as a"
"word of enlargement, that is to make the definition extensive and not restrictive."
"It  is  now  relevant  to  consider the  word  “include” used  in this definition  in  the"
"context in which it is used in the Agreement having regard to the Agreement as"
"a whole, the real intention of the parties and the surrounding circumstances."
"[25] Now the question is whether the passengers  who arrived in Sri Lanka on"
"the  SriLankan  Layover Programme  to  which  the  Agreement  applies  are  only"
"transit passengers and not tourists as determined by the TAC. It is significant"
"to note that a  passenger is defined in the Agreement to mean  “any person"
