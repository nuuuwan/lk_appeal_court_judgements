"[61]  This  proposition 
is 
further  confirmed  by  Sutherland’s  Statutory"
"Construction, Third Ed. Vol. 3. at p. 102 as follows:"
"“A statute specifying a time within which a public officer is to perform"
"an official act regarding the rights and duties of others is directory"
"unless the nature of the act to be performed, or the phraseology of"
"the statute, is such that the designation of time must be considered a"
"l
i
m
i
tation of the power of the Officer”. At p. 107 it is pointed out that"
"a
 statutory direction to private individuals should generally be"
"considered as mandatory and that the rule is just the opposite to that"
"which obtains with respect to public officers. Again, at p. 109, it is"
"pointed out that often the question as to whether a mandatory may"
"be directory construction should be given to a statutory provision"
"may be determined by an expression in the statute itself of the result"
"that shall follow the non-compliance with the provision....”"
