"[3] The Assessor by letter dated 16.03.2011 rejected the return of income",""
"for the said year of assessment for the following reasons:",""
"","1.  Sales of bunker fuel were made to the vessels within the harbors and"
"","waters in Sri Lanka or within the territorial waters of Sri Lanka for the"
"","purpose  of  consumption  of  bunker  fuel  during  the  voyage  of  the"
"","vessels. Therefore, the bunker fuel has not been delivered to a specific"
"destination outside Sri Lanka;",""
"","2.  The Lanka Marine Services Ltd is a supplier in Sri Lanka. Hence, Lanka"
"","Marine Services (Pvt) Ltd is involved in ship bunker trading business for"
"","the  supply  of  bunker  fuel  to  the  vessels  that  call  at  the  ports  of  Sri"
"","Lanka.  Accordingly,  Lanka  Marine  Services  (Pvt)  Ltd  is  a  supplier  of"
"","bunker  fuel  for  the  shipping  industry  and  not  an  exporter  of  bunker"
"fuel.  Therefore, 
the  company  does  not  qualify","for 
the 
tax 
rate"
"","applicable under Section 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006;"
"3.  The  concessionary  tax  rate  under  Section  42","is  applicable  to  the"
"","consignor  or  consignee  only  in  respect  of  profits  and  income  arising"
"","from  re-exports  of  any  petroleum,  gas  or  petroleum  products.  But"
"","according  to  the  terms  of  the  agreement  in  relation  to  the  supply  of"
"","marine lubricants, Lanka Marine Services (Pvt) Ltdâ€™s responsibility is to"
"","pump marine lubricants to the vessels calling at the ports of Sri Lanka"
"for the usage of the same vessel.",""
