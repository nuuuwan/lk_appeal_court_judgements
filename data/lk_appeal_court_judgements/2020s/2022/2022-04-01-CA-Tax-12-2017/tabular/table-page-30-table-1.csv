"made  an  appeal  on  25.07.2011,  but  the  appeal  was  treated  by  the"
"Respondent  as  a 
late  appeal  by  decision  of  the  Respondent  dated"
"29.08.2011."
"[74] Dr. Felix submitted that the question whether the appeal was timely"
"or  late  is  not  relevant  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  date  of  the"
"appeal and thus, upon the Appellant providing reasonable cause for the"
"delay in submitting the appeal, the appeal was accepted as a late appeal."
"He submitted that the  admission of the appeal as a late appeal does not"
"have the effect of postponing the date of receipt of the appeal in terms of"
"Section 165 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006."
"[75]  He  strenuously  argued  that  when  an  appeal  is  admitted  as  a  late"
"appeal, the date of the appeal is not decided  on the date on which the"
"decision is  made to admit the appeal as a late appeal, but it relates back"
"to the day on which the appeal was received by the Respondent or the"
"date of the acknowledgement provided, that this is done within 30 days"
"from the date of receipt of the appeal. On that basis, he argued that the"
"Appellant’s 
letter  dated  22.08.2011  or 
the  decision  made  by 
the"
"Respondent on 29.08.2011 to admit the appeal cannot be regarded as the"
"date of the petition of appeal as it does not set out the grounds of appeal."
"[76] He submitted that the appeal dated 25.07.2011 was received by the"
"Respondent on 26.07.2011 and that date shall be regarded as the date of"
"appeal,  and  as  the  determination  was  made  by  the  Respondent  on"
"12.08.2013,  the  two  year  time  bar  for  the  determination  of  the  appeal"
"ended on 25.07.2013. He submitted, therefore, that  the appeal is out of"
"time under Section 165 (14) of the Inland Revenue Act (as amended). He"
"relied  on  the  decision  of  this  Court  in  Union Strad v. Commissioner-"
"General of Inland Revenue (2013) CA Writ Application No. 255/2010 (Writ)"
"in support of his argument."
"[77]  The  learned  Deputy  Solicitor-General  has  submitted  in  the  written"
"submissions 
filed 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Respondent 
that 
letter 
of"
"acknowledgement  only 
refers 
to 
the  Appellant’s  appeal  made  on"
"22.08.2011 and not the purported appeal on 25.07.2011 and therefore,"
"the  determination  made  on  12.08.2013  by  the  Respondent  is  not  time"
"barred under Section 165 (14) of the Inland Revenue Act."
