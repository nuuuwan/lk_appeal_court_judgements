"Appellant  an  exporter  of  the  bunker  fuel  under  Sections  42  of  52  of  the"
"Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)."
"Use of Foreign Currency"
"[151] The learned Counsel for the Appellant citing the Exchange Control Act,"
"No. 24 of 1953, as amended, submitted that the fact that the Appellant is"
"permitted  by  the  Central  Bank  to  accept  foreign  currency  payments  for"
"supplies  of  marine  bunker  fuel  to  ships  travelling  in  international  waters"
"supports  the  position  of  the  Appellant  that  the  sales  undertaken  by  the"
"Appellant are not local sales but are in fact exports. He submitted that it is"
"an  offence  to  accept  foreign  currency  for  a  local  sale  and  therefore,  this"
"transaction should be construed to be an export."
"[152] On the other hand, the Central Bank has powers to permit any person"
"under Section 7 of the Exchange Control Act, to make any payment to, or"
"for the credit of a person resident outside Sri Lanka or make any payment"
"to or for the credit of a person resident in Sri Lanka. In my view the mere"
"fact that the sale of bunker fuel was paid for in foreign currency does not"
"necessarily render it an export within the meaning of Sections 42 or 52 of"
"the Inland Revenue Acts"
