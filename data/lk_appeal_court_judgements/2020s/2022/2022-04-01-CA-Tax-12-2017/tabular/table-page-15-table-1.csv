"“
Now the distinction between matters that are directory and matters"
"that are imperative is well known to us all in the common language of"
"the courts at Westminster. I am not sure that it is the most fortunate"
"l
anguage that could have been adopted to express the idea that it is"
"i
ntended to convey; but still, that is the recognised language, and I"
"propose to adhere to it. The real question in all these cases is this: A"
"thing has been ordered by the legislature to be done. What is the"
"consequence if it is not done? In the case of statutes that are said to"
"be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole"
"thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all voids. On the"
"other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or"
"d
i
rectory, they say that, although such provision may not have been"
"complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever"
"the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many"
"provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly"
"obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance"
"to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the legislature could"
"have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed by"
"a
 total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are"
"some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite"
"v
i
ew, and would feel that they are matters which must be strictly"
"obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow"
"must come to an end”."
