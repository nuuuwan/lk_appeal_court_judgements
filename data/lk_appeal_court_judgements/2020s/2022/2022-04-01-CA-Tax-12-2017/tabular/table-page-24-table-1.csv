"Commission reserved the determination (p. 267) and  thereafter, the"
"determination was made on 07.03.2017."
"[55]  If  the  time  limit  is  calculated  from  the  date  of  the  new  commission"
"commencing its hearing on 16.06.2016, the determination has been made"
"within a period of 8 months and 22 days, which is less than 270 days. It is"
"not 
in  dispute 
that  every  member  of 
the  Commission, 
including 
its"
"Chairman is appointed by the Minister to whom the subject of Finance is"
"assigned and such Member shall hold office for a specific period of time (S."
"2(4))."
"[56] 
It 
is  undisputed  that  after  a  vacancy  occurred  due  to  the  non-"
"availability of Mr. Junaid, a new member was appointed to the Tax Appeals"
"Commission, and after the term of office of the previous Chairman lapsed,"
"a new Commission with a new Chairman was appointed by the Ministry of"
"Finance. 
It 
is  absolutely  clear  that  though  the  hearing  of  the  appeal"
"commenced  on  24.06.2014, 
the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  could  not"
"practically conduct its   hearings due the vacancy occurred, and the term of"
"the  previous  commission  expired  and  thus,  no  further  hearing  could  be"
"held until the new Members of the Commission were appointed to hear the"
"appeal."
"[57]  It  was  thus,  practically  impossible  for  the  Commission  to  make  the"
"determination within a period of 270 days when a Member was unable to"
"perform  his  duty  due  to  health  reasons  and  the  period  of  the  previous"
"commission  expired.  Upon  the  appointment  of  the  members,  the  new"
"Commission  commenced  hearings  on  16.06.2016  and  10.11.2016  and"
"made 
the  determination  on  07.03.2017. 
I  do  not 
think  under  such"
"circumstances that it  was practically possible for the new Commission to"
"conclude its hearings within 270 days from the date of the initial hearing"
