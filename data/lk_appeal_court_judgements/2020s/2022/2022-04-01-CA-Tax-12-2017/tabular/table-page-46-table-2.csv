"“Now when we have to consider the construction of words such as this"
"occurring in Acts of Parliament, we must treat the question thus: If the"
"Act is directed to dealing with matters affecting everybody generally,"

"and understands to have a particular meaning in it, then the words are"
"to be construed as having that particular meaning, though it may differ"
"from the common or ordinary meaning of the words”."
