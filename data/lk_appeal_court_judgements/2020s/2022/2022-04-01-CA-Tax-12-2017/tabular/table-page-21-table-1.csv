"months of the date on which the Commission shall commence its sittings."
"(Vide-Section  7  of  the  Act,  No.  4  of  2012).  The  Tax  Appeals  Commission"
"(Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 extended the said time period to twenty-"
"four months from the date on which the Commission shall commence its"
"sittings for the hearing of each such appeal."
"[49]  It  is  crystal  clear  that  these  procedural  time  limit  rules  in  respect  of"
"appeals  received  by  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission  or  appeals  transferred"
"from  the  Board  of  Review  to  the  Commission  have  been  devised  by  the"
"legislature to facilitate the appeal process by increasing and reducing the"
"time period within which such appeals shall be concluded.  The provision"
"for the determination of an appeal by the Tax Appeals Commission within"
"a period of 270 days from the commencement of its sittings for the hearing"
"of an appeal has been designed with a view to regulating the duties of the"
"Tax Appeals Commission by specifying a time limit for its performance as"
"specified in Section 10 of the Act."
"[50] So that the legislature, in its wisdom has made provision in Section 10"
"to the effect that the appeal shall be disposed of speedily within a period"
"of  270  days  from  the  date  of  the  commencement  of  the  sittings  for  the"
"hearing of the appeal. But the legislature imposed no drastic and painful"
"penal  consequence  or  other  consequence  of  non-compliance,  including"
"prohibitory or negative words in Section 10, rendering the determination"
"of the appeal null and void for non-compliance of the time limit specified in"
"Section  10.  In  my  view,  they  are  not  intended  to  make  the  parties  suffer"
"from the failure of the Commission to make the determination within the"
"time limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act."
"[51]  Any  procedural  retrospective  operation  of  a  provision,  in  my  view,"
"cannot  take  away  the  rights  of  parties  who  have  no  control  over  those"
"entrusted  with  the  duty  of  making  determination  within  the  time  limit"
"specified in Section 10. The retrospective operation of Section 10 without"
"any  penal  or  other  consequence  of  non-compliance,  by  itself,  cannot  be"
"treated  as  a  factor  in  determining  that  the  legislature  intended  that  the"
"failure to adhere to the time limit specified in Section 10 is mandatory."
"Consequences of non-compliance of a statute by those entrusted with"
"public duty"
