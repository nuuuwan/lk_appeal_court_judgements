"interpretation  of  the  term  “export”  for  the  concessionary  tax  rate  under"
"Sections 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)."
"Customs Clearance"
"[147] The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Appellant"
"has a special customs entry passed when it issued marine bunker fuel to"
"foreign ships which are paid in foreign currency and such custom clearance"
"and payment made in foreign currency shall be regarded as evidence that"
"the supply  of  bunker  fuel was  an export transaction outside Sri Lanka in"
"terms of the provisions of the Protection of Government Revenue (Special"
"Provisions)  Act  No.  1  of  2006.  The  Appellant  also  relies  on  the  Indian"
"decision in CIT v. Silver and Arts Palace (2003) 259 ITR 684 to argue that the"
"customs  clearance  is  evidence  that  characterizes  the  transaction  as  an"
"export. It is the position of the Appellant that  once the goods are kept in"
"the  customs  clearance  station,  then,  the  goods  shall  be  deemed  to  have"
"been in the export stream."
"[148] The said case related to the refusal of the deduction claimed by the"
"assessed  under Section  80HHC   of  The 
Income-  Tax  Act,  1995  placing"
"reliance  on  Explanation  (aa)  to Section  80HHC(4A) of  the  Act.   The  said"
"Section provides that ""'export out of India' shall not include any transaction"
"by  way  of 
sale  or  otherwise, 
in  a 
shop,  emporium  or  any  other"
"establishment  situate  in  India,  not 
involving  clearance  at  any  customs"
"station  as  defined  in  the Customs  Act,  1962  (52  of  1962).""  There  was  no"
"despite  in  that  case  that  transactions  of  counter  sales  effected  by  the"
"respondent involved customs clearance within the meaning of Explanation"
"(aa)  to Section  80HHC(4A) of  the  Act,  and  further  that  the  sales  were  in"
"convertible foreign exchange."
"[149] 
If  the  above 
interpretation  applies  to  the  export 
in  question  as"
"projected  by  Dr.  Felix  in  the  written  submissions  filed  on  behalf  of  the"
"Appellant, then, it would mean that irrespective of the condition in Sections"
"42  or  52  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act,    the  delivery  of  goods  shall  be  after"
"customs clearance, i.e., after goods have cleared all local customs and all"
"other legal formalities and are kept ready for delivery to the ship’s tanks,"
"the Appellant would qualify for the concessionary tax rates specified in the"
"Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act."
"[150] In my opinion, the concept sought to put in service in CIT v. Silver and"
"Arts Palace (supra) cannot be applied to the facts of this case and therefore,"
"the  submission  of  customs  clearance  per  se  does  not  constitute  an"
