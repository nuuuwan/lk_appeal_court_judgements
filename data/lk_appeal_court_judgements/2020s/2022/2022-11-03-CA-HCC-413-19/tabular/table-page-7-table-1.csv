"making a complaint to the police after the incident. When PW-1 was"
"questioned  about  this,  she  stated  that  since  she  did  not  know  the"
"name  of  the  appellant,  she  did  not  mention  about  him.  She  stated"
"clearly in  her  evidence  that  she  knew  the  appellant  prior  to  the"
"incident because he lived in the same village. However, when she gave"
"her  history  to  the  doctor  who  examined  her  after  the  incident,  she"
"stated  that  on  15th  March  2008,  an  unknown  person  had  sexual"
"intercourse with her forcibly. PW-5, the doctor also confirmed in his"
"testimony  that  PW-1  stated  in  giving  the  history  that  an  unknown"
"person  raped  her.  Hence,  it  is  apparent  that  if  she  identified  the"
"appellant at the time of the incident, she should have at least told the"
"doctor that a known person had raped her. By stating to the doctor"
"two days after the incident that an unknown person raped her, it is"
"evident  that  she  had  not  identified  the  person  who  raped  her  and"
"sexually abused her."
