"The prosecutrix had opened the almirah and had given him jewelry."
"Thereafter, he had pressed a pillow against the face of the prosecutrix"
"and had turned her to the other side, and left her, threatening not to"
"get up until the morning."
"A
lthough  six  grounds  of  appeal  have  been  stated 
in  the  written"
"submission tendered on behalf of the appellant, the learned Counsel"
"for the appellant pursued only the following two grounds:"
"a)  The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  has 
failed 
to  consider 
the"
"weakness of the evidence in respect of the identification of the"
"appellant."
"b)  The learned High Court Judge has failed to give the benefit of"
"the doubt to the accused-appellant considering the difficulty of"
"identifying the offender in low light."
"H
ence, the only issue to be determined in this appeal is whether there"
"was  proper 
identification  of 
the  accused-appellant.  The 
report"
"pertaining to the identification parade held in the Magistrate’s Court"
"of  Balangoda  has  been  marked  as  P-3.  Accordingly,  PW-1, 
the"
"prosecutrix,  has  identified  the  appellant  in  the  identification  parade"
"as  the  person  who  committed  the  rape  and  grave  sexual  abuse."
"Identifying  the  accused  in  the  identification  parade  is  a  piece  of"
"evidence that helps to prove the identity of the accused. However, it is"
"not conclusive proof regarding the identification, and the said evidence"
"has to be evaluated with the other circumstances of the case."
"I
n the case at hand, PW-1 stated in her evidence, found at page 96 of"
"the appeal brief, that “William,” to whom the prosecutrix had informed"
"this incident, told her  that the villagers who attended a funeral had"
"told him that this offence may have been committed by the appellant"
