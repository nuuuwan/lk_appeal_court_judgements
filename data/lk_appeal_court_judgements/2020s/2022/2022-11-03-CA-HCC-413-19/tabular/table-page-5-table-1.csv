"and some other boy. When the appellant and the other person were"
"drunk  and  misbehaving  at  the  funeral, the  villagers  who  were  there"
"had said so. Under these circumstances, even if PW-1 did not see who"
"committed the offences, she could have identified the appellant in the"
"identification parade because she stated that the appellant is a known"
"person in the village. Even at the commencement of the identification"
"parade, objection has been taken on behalf of the appellant that there"
"was no purpose in holding an identification parade, as the appellant"
"and PW-1 knew each other."
