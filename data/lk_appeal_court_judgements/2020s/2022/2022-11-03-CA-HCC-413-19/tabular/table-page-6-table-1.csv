"she asked the court to consider the fact that PW-1 had the opportunity"
"to see the offender because the offender was in close proximity to her."
"“Turnbull rules” or guidelines regarding the identification were set out"
"in the case of Regina V. Turnbull - (1976) 3 WLR 445. According to the"
"Turnbull  rules,  it  has  to  be  examined  closely  the  circumstances  in"
"which the identification by each witness had been made. How long did"
"the witness have the accused under observation? At what distance? In"
"what  light?  are  material  factors  to  be  considered.  According  to  the"
"“Turnbull rules”, the distance between the witness and the accused is"
"also a relevant factor in identification. However, these guidelines are"
"to be applied in instances where the witness could see the face of the"
"accused.  In  the  instant  action,  although  the  offender  was  in  close"
"proximity to the PW-1, she could not see his face but had only seen"
"his eyes. Therefore, the issue here is not that she had the opportunity"
"to  see  him  in  close  proximity  but  whether  she  could  identify  the"
"offender by only seeing his eyes."
