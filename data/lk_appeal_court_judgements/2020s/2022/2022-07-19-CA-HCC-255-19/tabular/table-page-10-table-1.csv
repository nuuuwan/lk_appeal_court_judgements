"O
rdinarily,  a  witness  cannot  be  expected 
to  recall  accurately 
the"

"The aforesaid portion of the Indian Supreme Court Judgment is cited"
"in 
the  case  of  A.K.  Kamal  Rasika  Amarasinghe  V.  OIC  Special"
"Investigation  Unit 
and  Hon. 
Attorney  General 
- 
SC 
Appeal"
"No.140/2010  –  Special  Leave 
to  Appeal  No.118/10,  decided  on"
"18.07.2018."
"I
n  considering  the  aforesaid  circumstances  with  the  decisions  and"
"observations  of  the  aforesaid 
judicial  authorities,  I  hold  that  the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  has  correctly  assessed  and  evaluated  the"
"contradictions in this case and held that those contradictions have not"
"affected the credibility of the prosecution case. For the reasons stated"
"above, the appeal would not succeed on the first ground of appeal."
"T
he learned counsel for the appellant advanced the argument that the"
"chain of production had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt,"
"by  drawing  attention  to  the  fact  that  Amila  Wijesekera  who  had"
"accepted  productions  from  the  Hingurakgoda  Magistrate  Court  was"
"not  called  in  evidence.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  necessity  of  calling"
"witnesses  to  establish  the  chain  of  production  is  to  ensure  that  the"
"productions taken from the custody of the accused-appellant have in"
"fact been forwarded to the Government Analyst. There is no dispute on"
"the facts that PW-1 requested from the Magistrate Court by way of an"
"affidavit  marked  ‘P5’  to  send  the  productions  to  the  Government"
"Analyst, after the relevant productions have been handed over to the"
"Magistrate  Court.  PW-8,  P.S.  25608  then  took  the  productions  and"
"handed them over to the Government Analyst. A memorandum issued"
"10"
