"In the instant matter the Counsel for the suspect submitted that, the Police have"
"not filed a certificate as per Section 8(1) of the relevant Act, if that is so the instant"
"matter has to be considered under the provisions of the Bail Act."
"The State Counsel appearing on behalf of the Attorney General further drew the"
"attention of this Court to the B report which is marked as P6 which reveals the"
"fact that the Police had not been able to ascertain the value of the production"
"which is supposed to be lost. The subsequent B reports filed also do not reveal a"
"Gazetted Officer certifying the value of the property involved."
"Therefore,  this  Court  cannot  conclude  that  the  instant  matter  falls  within  the"
"provisions  of  the  Offences  against  Public  Property  Act  No.12  of  1982.  As  such,"
"exceptional circumstances are not needed to consider bail but as this is a revision"
"application which has been filed to set aside the Order of the High Court, it is well"
"established law that a person filling a revision application must plead exceptional"
"circumstances which shocks the conscious of Court in the impugned order, in a"
"revision application."
"In the instant matter, the learned High Court Judge had concluded in the order"
"that there is no certification as to the value of the property involved by a Gazetted"
"Officer. But he has proceeded to conclude that it is a public property which in the"
"opinion of this Court is a clear violation of Section 8(1) of the said Act. Therefore,"
"we see a circumstance which shocks the conscious of this Court in the impugned"
"order of the High Court Judge."
"As such the instant application for revision application is allowed and the suspect"
"namely Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Manjula Disssanayake is hereby enlarged on"
"bail on the following conditions,"
