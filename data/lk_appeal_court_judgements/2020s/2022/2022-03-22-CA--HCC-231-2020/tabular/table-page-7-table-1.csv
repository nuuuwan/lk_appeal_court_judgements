"succession,  where  PW1  had  no  time  to  shout  and  alert  his  mother."
"Further,  The  appellant  himself  stated  in  his  dock  statement  that  PW1"
"was  also  present.  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  argument"
"raised by the Counsel to the appellant was untenable and unreasonable."

"her  to  the  hospital.  It  was  further  revealed  from  the  evidence  that  she"
"had also made a dying declaration to her husband while she was taking"
"treatment

recorded  a"
"statement containing the dying declaration  from the  deceased while she"
"was in the Matara General Hospital."
