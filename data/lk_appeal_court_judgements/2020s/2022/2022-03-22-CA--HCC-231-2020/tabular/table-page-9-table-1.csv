"It  was  argued  for  the  appellant  that  PW6  the  police  officer,  had  not"
"recorded  statements  from  the  doctor  or  nurse  who  was  on  duty,  at  the"
"time  when  he  recorded  the  statement 
from  the  deceased.  PW6  had"
"recorded a statement from  the deceased after  consulting the doctor and"
"nurse  who  were  on  duty. 
  As  per  his  evidence,  the  statement  was"
"recorded on the sixteenth.  The deceased died on the twentieth. Had the"
"deceased survived, this statement would have been only a statement. The"
"Learned  Trial  Judge  has  cited  from  the  Bench  Book  Law  of  Evidence,"
"the  Law  of  Evidence  E.R.S.R.  Coomaraswamy,  Ranjit  vs.  The  State"

"attention to his wife rather than going to the police. The evidence of PW1,"
"an eyewitness, is sufficient to support the conviction."
"The fourth ground of appeal is that the first information does not contain"
"the  name  of  the  appellant.  This  argument  is  factually  incorrect.  The"
"police message from the police post of  the  Matara  General  Hospital was"
"received  by  the  Tangalle  Police  Station  at  2.00  pm  on  the  fifteenth  of"
