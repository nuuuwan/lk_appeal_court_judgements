"Witnesses  of  certain  facts  leads  to  inference  of  admission  of  that"
"fact’."
"If  the  deceased  tried  to  commit  suicide,  there 
is  no  reason 
for  the"
"appellant to flee that place where the incident took place. Counsel for the"
"appellant  argued  that  the  11-year  old  PW1  could  have  poured  water  on"
"the deceased and extinguished the fire. However, it can be commented on"
"the fact that the appellant being an adult, he could have done the same"
"instead  of 
fleeing  the  place.  There  was  nothing  to  suggest  that  the"
"incident  was  a  suicide.  The  appellant’s  position  in  the  dock  statement"
"was  not  put  to  PW1  or  any  other  witnesses.  Therefore,  this  argument"
"cannot be accepted."
"The final and alternative argument is that “The Learned Trial Judge has"
"failed  to  consider  the  availability  of  the  defense  of  sudden  provocation"
"which can be seen from the permitted dying declaration.”"
"Counsel for the appellant quoted the following statement of the deceased:"
"“ඊට පසු ඔහු එස ේ කතා කරලා මසග උරයට අත තිබිබා.  ඊට පසු මසග ඇගට අත"
"තියන්න  එපා  කියලා  මම  එයාසග  පපුව  විකුවා.    The  argument  is  that  if  this"
"portion  is  believed,  there  should  have  been  a  struggle  or  altercation"
"between 
the  appellant  and 
the  deceased.  However, 
to  establish 
the"
"ingredients  to  come within  the  general  exception  of  a  grave and  sudden"
"provocation  was  not  visible 
from 
the  evidence.  The  defence  never"
"suggested  or  posed  any  question  to  any  of  the  witnesses  on  this  basis."
"The  Learned  Trial  Judge  could  not  have  considered  such  a  defense"
"without sufficient evidence. Therefore this argument is not sustainable."
"In the above circumstances, it is evident that there is sufficient evidence"
"to support the conviction of the appellant. There is no reason to interfere"
