"(1) Where it is provided in any permit or, license that such permit or license is personal to"
"the  Grantee  thereof,  all  rights  under  such  Permit  or  license  shall  be  finally  determined  by  the"
"death of grantee."
"(2)Where it is provided in any permit or license that such permit or license shall be personal"
"to  the  grantee  thereof,  the  land  in  respect  of  which  such  permit  or  license  was  issued  and  all"
"improvements effected thereon shall, on the death of the grantee, be the property of the Crown,"
"and no person claiming through, from or under the grantee shall have any interest in such land or"
"be entitled to any compensation for any such improvements."
"For these reasons, we quash the Quit Notice(“P6a”) issued to the 2nd Petitioner. As"
"the 1st Petitioner, has failed to adduce any material to substantiate the position that the"
"permit  was  renewed  annually,  the  Quit  Notice  issued  to  the  1st  Petitioner  (“P5a”)  will"
"stand valid. The relief prayed for by the 3rd Petitioner cannot be granted because of the"
"personal nature of the permit, as aforesaid. We make no order for costs."
