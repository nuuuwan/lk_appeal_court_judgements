"stated  during  the  inquest  that  he  suspects  Chuti  and  two  other  persons"
"regarding  the  murder  of  the  deceased.  He  further  admitted  during  cross"
"examination  that  he  had  not  mentioned  the  names  of  the  2nd,  3rd  and  4th"
"Appellants to the police."
"Considering  the  evidence  given  by  PW2,  PW3  and  PW4  with  regard  to  the"
"identity of the 1st Appellant and the 4th Appellant, there are contradictions"
"and omissions which certainly affect the outcome of the decision."
"The proof of contradiction is vital to destroy the credibility of the case of the"
"prosecution. Proved contradictions and omissions which can affect the case"
"of the prosecution plays a vital role in a criminal case."
"PW2 is the most important witness in this case. The contradictions marked"
"in her evidence are vital and certainly affects her credibility. They also raise"
"doubts about the probability of the incident as described by the PW2. What"
"she told to the police and at the inquest needs to be considered carefully as"
"PW2 had fresh memory regarding the incident when she gave her statement"
"and evidence during the inquest. Failing to mention important facts which"
"result  in  the  failure  to  accurately  identify  the  accused  certainly  affect  the"
"prosecution case."
"Further PW2’s omission in mentioning the 4th Appellant’s name to the police"
"and at the inquest affects her credibility in this case. These omissions should"
"not  be  considered  lightly,  as  it  certainly  affects  the  conviction  of  the  4th"
"Appellant."
"The contradictions and omissions marked on PW2’s evidence certainly have"
"a  negative  impact  on  the  evidence  given  by  PW4  as  she  had  said  that  the"
"identity  of  the  1st  Appellant  was  revealed  by  PW2  when  she  gave  her"
"statement to the police."
