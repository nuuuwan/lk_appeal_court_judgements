"In  this  case  the  prosecution  had  led  very  strong  circumstantial  evidence"
"against  the  1st  Appellant  and  it  is  consistent  only  with  the  guilt  of  the"
"appellant  and  is  totally  inconsistent  with  his  innocence.  Hence  his  final"
"ground is also devoid any merit."
"Now I am going to consider the appeal ground advanced by the counsels for"
"the 2nd and the 3rd Appellants that using of the confession made by the 1st"
"Appellant  is  inadmissible  against  the  2nd  and  3rd  Appellants  and  their"
"conviction is therefore illegal and bad in law."
"At this stage Learned President’s Counsel who appeared for the 3rd Appellant"
"had  requested  the  court  to  allow  his  submissions  be  made  prior  to  the"
"counsel for the 2nd Appellant. Accordingly, the application was allowed."
"The Learned President’s Counsel contended that it is a settled law that the"
"confession of an accused cannot be taken as an item of evidence against the"
"other accused in a criminal trial."
"In this case as stated above the death of the deceased was came to light upon"
"the confession made by the 1st Appellant to PW4, who in return conveyed the"
"same to PW1. Thereafter, PW1 had called the Police Emergency Unit (119)"
"and  the  police  commenced  investigations.  Upon  the  said  information  the"
"police  arrested  the  1st  Appellant  first  and  the  2nd  and  the  3rd  Appellants"
"thereafter. The reason for the prompt arrest of 2nd and 3rd Appellants is the"
"confession made by the 1st Appellant to the witness PW04."
