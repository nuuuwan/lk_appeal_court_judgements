"In this case the prosecution had led incriminating circumstantial evidence"
"against the 1st Appellant and the circumstances established were consistent"
"with the 1st Appellantâ€™s guilt and inconsistence with his innocence. Hence, I"
"proceed to dismiss his appeal."
"As the case against the 2nd Appellant was not contested by the Respondent,"
"his appeal is allowed and he is acquitted from the charge."
"As mentioned above, no plausible evidence is led against the 3rd Appellant."
"Therefore, her appeal is allowed and she is acquitted from the charge."
"The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court"
"of Kurunegala along with the original case record."
