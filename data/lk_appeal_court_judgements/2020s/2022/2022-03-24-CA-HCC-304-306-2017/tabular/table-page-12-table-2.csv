"In Ranjith v. State [2000] 3 SLR page 346 the court held that:"
"“As regards the evidence relating to the recovery of blood-stained clothes"
"it  appears  that  these  clothes  had  not  been  sent  to  the  Government"
"Analyst for examination and report. Hence, there is no evidential value"
"to consider  that  item of evidence  as  an  item of incriminating  evidence"
"against the accused appellant.”"
