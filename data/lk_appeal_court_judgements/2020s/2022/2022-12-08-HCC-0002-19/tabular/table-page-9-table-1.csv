"According to the doctor’s evidence, the shooting could have taken place"
"from a distance of 3 to 10 feet. Therefore, when the PW-5 says that the"
"appellant shot at the deceased from a distance of about 15 feet, it tallies"
"with the doctor’s evidence. Also, the doctor has expressed his opinion"
"that, most probably, the person who shot the deceased was on the left"
"side of the deceased. He has also stated that it was possible that the"
"firearm  was  in  a  higher  position  than  the  position  of  the  deceased."
"PW-5’s testimony about the place from which the appellant fired at the"
"deceased  is  also  consistent  with  the  expert  opinion  that  the  JMO"
"expressed as more probable because the appellant could have shot at"
"the deceased from his left when the appellant was hiding in the culvert"
"as  described  by  PW-5.  Hence,  the  eyewitness’s  evidence  has  been"
"corroborated by the medical evidence."
