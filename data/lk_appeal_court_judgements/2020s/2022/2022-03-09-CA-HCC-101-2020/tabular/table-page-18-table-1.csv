"In this case, the Learned High Court Judge has carefully considered and"
"evaluated the evidence of PW2. PW2 did not try to help the prosecution."
"He  was  not  biased 
towards 
the  prosecution.  The  prosecution  could"
"definitely rely upon the evidence of PW2."
"The next argument is that the Learned Trial Judge should not have relied"
"on  the  evidence  regarding  the  dying  declaration,  one  reason  being  that"
"the Trial Judge rejected the evidence of PW 8, and the other was that PW"
"4  did  not  know  to  whom  the  deceased  referred  to  as  'Pradeep'.  It  was"
"further  argued  that  after  receiving  the  stab  injuries,  the  deceased  was"
"not in a position to speak, or at least it was doubtful whether he was able"
"to speak."
"PW4  did  not  know  who  Pradeep  was.  PW4  tried  to  save  the  deceased"
"from  stabbing  by  the  assailant  and  he  himself  got 
injured.  At  that"
"moment, the deceased told him that Pradeep stabbed him. There was no"
"time  gap  between  the  stabbing  and  the  dying  declaration.  PW  2  stated"
"that  he 
saw 
the  appellant  bend 
the  deceased  and  assault  him."
"Immediately 
the  deceased  ran 
towards  PW2  and  said 
that  Pradeep"
"stabbed  him.  PW4  was  not  cross-examined,  and  his  testimony  stands"
"uncontested.  Therefore,  the  fact  that  the  deceased  had  told  PW4  that"
"Pradeep  stabbed  him  is  established.  Though  PW4  did  not  know  the"
"appellant,    PW2  knew  the  appellant  and  his  name  from  his  childhood."
"The  wife  of  the  deceased  also  testified  that  PW2  told  that  Pradeep"
"stabbed the deceased."
"Now  I  consider  whether  the  deceased  was  able  to  speak  after  receiving"
"the injuries."
