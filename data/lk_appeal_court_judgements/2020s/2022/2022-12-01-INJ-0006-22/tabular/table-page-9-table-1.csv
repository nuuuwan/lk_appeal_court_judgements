"A  performance  bond  is  similar  to  letters  of  credit  issued  by  the  bank,  and  the  said  bank  is"
"obliged  to  pay  once  the  demand  is  made  if  it  satisfied  the  terms  stipulated.  It  is  a  contract"
"independent of the underline main agreement between the petitioner and the Respondents. The"
"dispute between the petitioner and the respondents in this instance is not a dispute between the"
"bank and the beneficiary in whose favor the performance guarantee has been issued."
