"In Indica Traders (Pvt) Limited v Seoul Lanka Constructions (Pvt) Limited and others"
"(1994) 3 SLR 387. it was held"
"“It is thus clear that business transactions between a bank and a beneficiary, constituted in the"
"nature of a performance bond, a performance guarantee, letter of guarantee or a irrevocable"
"letter of credit, whereby the bank is obliged to pay money to a beneficiary, are not tripartite"
"transactions  between  the  bank  (surety),  the  beneficiary  (creditor)  and  the  party  at  whose"
"instance the bond, guarantee or letter is issued (the principal debtor) but, simply transactions"
"between the bank and the beneficiary. A bank thereby guarantees to the beneficiary payment"
"of money and is obliged to honour that guarantee according to its terms. Any dispute that may"
"arise between the beneficiary (creditor) and the party at whose instance the guarantee or letter"
"is given (the principal debtor), on the underlying contract, cannot be urged to restrain the bank"
"from  honouring  the  guarantee  or  letter  according  to  its  terms.  In  an  application  for  an"
"injunction to restrain the bank from making payment, the Court has to consider whether there"
"is  a  challenge  to  the  validity  of  the  bond,  guarantee  or  letter  itself,  upon  which  payment  is"
"claimed and whether the conditions as specified in writing are satisfied. If the challenge to the"
"validity is not substantial and the conditions as specified in the writing are met, prima facie no"
"injunction should be granted and the bank should be left free to honour its obligation."
"The only exception to this general rule is where it is established by the party applying for the"
"injunction that a claim for payment upon such bond, guarantee or letter is clearly fraudulent."
"A mere plea of fraud put in for the purpose of bringing the case within this exception and which"
"rest on the uncorroborated statement of the applicant  will not suffice. An injunction.may be"
"granted  only  in  circumstances  where  the  Court  is  satisfied  that  the  bank  should  not  effect"
"payment. Therefore, an injunction may be granted on the ground of fraud only where there is"
"clear evidence as to:"
"(i) the fact of fraud and,"
"(ii) the knowledge of the bank as to the facts constituting the fraud…..”"
