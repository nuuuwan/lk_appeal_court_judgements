"The  Petitioner  is  inviting  this  Court  to  injunct  the  Respondents  from  encashing  or  form"
"releasing  the  performance  guarantee  issued  on  behalf  of  the  Petitioner.    The  Performance"
"guarantee  marked  as  P8b  is  a  contract  between  the  bank  and  in  this  instance  the  Secretary"
"Ministry of Urban Development and Housing who is the beneficiary."
"In Edward Owen Engineering Ltd vs Barclays Bank International Ltd 1978 1 ALL ER"
"976 it was held"
"“A performance guarantee was similar to a confirmed letter of credit. Where. therefore, a bank"
"had given a performance guarantee it was required to honour the guarantee according to its"
"terms and was not concerned whether either party to the contract which underlay the guarantee"
"was in default. The only exception to that rule was  where fraud by one of the parties to the"
"underlying contract had been established and the bank had notice of the fraud. …………”"
"This principle has been followed in a number of cases in Sri Lanka."
"In Hemas Marketing Pvt Ltd vs Chandrasiri and others 1994 2SLR 181, it was held “When"
"a  bank  has  given  a  guarantee,  it  is  required  to  honor  it  according  to  its  terms  and  is  not"
"concerned whether either party to the contract which underlay the contract was in default. The"
"whole purpose of such commercial instruments was to provide security which was to be readily,"
"promptly and assuredly realizable when the prescribed event occurred. The only exception to"
"the rule is where fraud by one of the parties to the underlying contract has been established"
"and the bank had notice of the fraud. A mere plea of fraud put in for the purpose of bringing"
"the case within this exception and which rests in the uncorroborated statements of the applicant"
"will not suffice."" In the said judgment, Dr. Ranaraja J further observed as follows, ""It is only"
"in  exceptional  circumstances  that  Courts  will  interfere  with  the  machinery  of  obligations"
"assumed by the banks. They are the lifeblood of international commerce. Such obligations are"
"regarded as collateral to underlying rights and obligations between merchants at either end of"
"the banking chain. Courts will leave the merchants to settle their disputes under the contract"
"by litigation."""
