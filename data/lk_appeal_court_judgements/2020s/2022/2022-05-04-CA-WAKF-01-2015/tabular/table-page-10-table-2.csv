"mutatis mutandis, apply to and in relation to appeals from orders of the"
"Tribunal….”"
"Moreover, for the purposes of dealing with offences of contempt against the"
"authority of the Tribunal, the provisions of Section 55 of the Judicature Act,"
"No. 2 of 1978, shall, mutatis mutandis, apply as though the references therein"
"to a District Court were references to the Tribunal (vide sections 55A and 55B"
"of the Act)."
"As such, to my mind, the argument advanced by the learned Counsel for the"
"Respondent  stating  that  the  Tribunal  is  bound  to  follow  the  Civil  Procedure"
"Code only with regard to the execution of its orders and judgments is devoid"
"of merits."
"Admittedly, in the instant case, the Tribunal has not adhered to the provisions"
"of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  in  conducting  the  inquiry/trial  in  dispute.  The"
"pleadings were not filed in accordance with the Civil Procedure Code and the"
"inquiry/trial  was  not  held  as  per  the  provisions  of  the  said  Code.    In  these"
"respects,  it  is  manifestly  clear  that  the  impugned  judgment  of  the  Wakf"
"Tribunal  is  illegal  and  bad  in  law.  As  such,  it  is  the considered view of  this"
"Court that the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside on that ground alone."
"The  aforesaid  ground  of  appeal  advanced  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"appellants is a pure question of law, and therefore, the same can be taken up"
"in appeal at any time though this issue was not raised before the Tribunal and"
"not set out in the petitions of appeal."
"For the above reasons, I allow the appeal with costs fixed at Rs. 15,000/ and"
"set aside the judgment of the Wakf Tribunal dated 21.03.2015."
