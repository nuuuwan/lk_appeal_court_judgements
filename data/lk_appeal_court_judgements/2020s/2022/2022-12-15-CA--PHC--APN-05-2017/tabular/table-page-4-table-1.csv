"(hereinafter the ‘first respondent’), in contradiction to the prevailing law on"
"the subject."
"The facts of the instant case are as follows. The petitioner claims that the"
"accused-respondent-respondent (hereinafter the ‘second respondent’) took"
"ownership of the impugned vehicle (a van) which was originally owned by"
"the petitioner, through fraudulent means by supplying the petitioner with"
"invalid  cheques.  After  this  initial  transaction  took  place  between  the"
"petitioner  and  the  second  respondent,  the  ownership  of  the  impugned"
"vehicle has passed onto several other people, until it was vested with the"
"first respondent. The police who have been tracking the said vehicle upon"
"complaints by the petitioner of cheque fraud, have finally seized the vehicle"
"while  it  was  under  the  alleged  ownership  of  the  first  respondent.  The"
"impugned  vehicle  and  the  first  respondent  were  produced  before  the"
"Magistrate’s Court of  Jaffna  under  the  case number B 936/2013 for an"
"inquiry under section 431 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act."
"The learned Magistrate by order dated 11.03.2015 released the vehicle to"
"the first respondent, as the vehicle had been seized from his possession."
"Thereafter,  a  separate  case  under  section  403  of  the  Penal  Code  for"
"‘cheating and dishonestly inducting a delivery of property’ has been filed"
"against the second respondent pertaining to the alleged fraud committed"
"by him, which is currently in progress in Jaffna High Court. The petitioner"
"being aggrieved by the learned Magistrate’s decision to release the vehicle"
"back to the first respondent, has made a revision application to the High"
"Court  of  Jaffna,  and  the  learned  High  Court  judge  has  dismissed  the"
"application and affirmed the learned Magistrate’s decision by order dated"
"27.07.2015.  Thereafter,  the  petitioner  has  preferred  the  instant  revision"
"application  to  this  Court  to  have  the  above  two  decisions  set  aside  and"
"release the impugned vehicle to the petitioner."
"For  ease  of  reference,  section  431(1)  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure"
