"In line with the above well-established precedent, the present application should"
"be evaluated. The petitioner in her pleadings has failed to establish a strong case"
"depicting a positive miscarriage of justice, and a manifestly erroneous decision of"
"such a nature that would shock the conscience of the Court. She has only cited"
"Silva  v.  Officer-in-Charge  (supra)  on  the  interpretation  of  the  phrase  ‘person"
"entitled  to  the  possession’  and  that  the  impugned  vehicle  is  an  item  having"
"potential evidentiary value - “fruits of the crime” and thus should not be handed"
"over to the first respondent."
"However,  in  line  with  the  above  evaluation  of  the  section  431  of  the  Code  and"
"Article  138  of  the  Constitution,  the  petitioner  has  failed  to  establish  that  the"
"learned  Magistrate  and  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  have  made  manifestly"
"erroneous orders of such a nature that would shock the conscience of the Court,"
"resulting in a failure of justice. For the above reasons, this Court affirms the order"
"of  the  Magistrate  Court  dated  11.03.2015  and  order  of  the  High  Court  dated"
"27.07.2015."
"Application dismissed."
