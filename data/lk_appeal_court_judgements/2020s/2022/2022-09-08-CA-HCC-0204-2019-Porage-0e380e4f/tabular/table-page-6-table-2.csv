"[1985] CRI. LJ. 493 at 498/499 held;"
"â€œWhile appreciating the evidence of a"
"witness, the approach must be whether the"
"evidence  of  a  witness  read  as  a  whole"
"appears  to  have  ring  of  truth.  Once  that"
"impression 
is 
formed, 
it 
is  undoubtedly"
"necessary  for 
the  court 
to  scrutinize 
the"
"evidence  more particularly keeping  in view"
"the deficiencies, drawbacks and infirmities"
"pointed out in the evidence as a whole and"
"evaluate 
them 
to 
find  out  whether 
it 
is"
"against  the  general  tenor  of  the  evidence"
"given  by 
the  witness  and  whether 
the"
"earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken"
"as  to  tender  it  unworthy  of  belief.  Minor"
"discrepancies 
on 
trivial 
matters 
not"
"touching 
the 
core 
of 
the 
case,  hyper-"
"technical  approach  by 
taking  sentences"
"torn  out  of  context  here  and 
there 
from"
"evidence,  attaching 
importance 
to  some"
"technical 
error 
committed 
by 
the"
"investigating officer not  going to the root of"
"the  matter  would  not  ordinarily  permit"
"rejection  of  the  evidence  as  a  whole.  If  the"
"court 
before  whom 
the  witness 
gives"
"evidence  had  the  opportunity  to  form  the"
"opinion about the general tenor of evidence"
"given  by  the  witness,  the  appellate  court"
"which  had  not 
this  benefit  will  have 
to"
"attach  due  weight  to  the  appreciation  of"
"evidence by the trial court and unless there"
"are 
reasons  weighty  and 
formidable 
it"
"would  not  be  proper  to  reject  the  evidence"
