"It was the contention of the Appellant that the Primary Court has no jurisdiction over the disputed"
"subject  matter  since  there  were  three  partition  cases  pending  in  the  High  Court.  It  was  held  in"
"Kanagasabai Vs. Mylwaganam 78 NLR 282-283;"
"“Mere pendency of a suit in a civil Court is wholly an irrelevant circumstance and"
"does not take away the dispute which had necessitated a proceeding under Section 66"
"of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act.”"
"Thus, jurisdiction of the Primary Court would not oust to proceed with the instant matter."
"T
he learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge has followed the procedure"
"stipulated under Section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act and had taken up the matter for"
"inquiry.  After  the  conclusion  of  the  inquiry,  the  learned  Magistrate  delivered  the  Order  on"
"11.02.1999 in favour of the 1st Party-Respondent-Respondents declaring that they are entitled to"
"the possession of the disputed subject matter."
"B
eing aggrieved by the said Order dated 14.02.1999, the Party of the 2nd Part-Petitioner-Appellant"
"[hereinafter referred to as the Appellant] made an application bearing No. HCRA 22/1999 to the"
"Provincial High Court of Galle seeking to revise the aforesaid Order."
"H
owever,  it  was  submitted  in  the  petition  of  appeal  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  being"
"satisfied with the merits of the said revision application of the Appellant and with the consent of"
"the Appellant and the Respondents, set aside the aforesaid Order of the learned Magistrate made"
"on 11.02.1999 in the Magistrate’s Court of Galle and directed the learned Magistrate to deliver a"
"fresh Order in terms of Section 68 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act [hereinafter referred to as"
"the Act]. Apparently, the learned Magistrate delivered the Order on 18.08.2000 in favour of the"
"Respondents for the reasons stated therein."
"B
eing aggrieved by the said Order, the Appellant made a revision application bearing No. HCRA"
"72/2000  to  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  Galle  to  revise  or  set  aside  the  said  Order.  The  said"
"application was taken up for inquiry and the parties agreed to dispose the matter by way of written"
"submissions.  Subsequently,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  delivered  the  Order  on  16.09.2003,"
"considering the merits of the application."
