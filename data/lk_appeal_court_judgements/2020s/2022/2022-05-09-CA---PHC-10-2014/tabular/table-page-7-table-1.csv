"The main issue for the determination under Section 68(1) is, as to who was in possession of the"
"land or part thereof on the date of filing the information under Section 66. However, the Court can"
"act  under  Section  68(3)  and  make  a  determination  as  to  whether  such  dispossession  has  been"
"affected  within  two  months  prior  to  filing  of  the  information,  when  there  is  an  allegation  of  a"
"forcible dispossession."
