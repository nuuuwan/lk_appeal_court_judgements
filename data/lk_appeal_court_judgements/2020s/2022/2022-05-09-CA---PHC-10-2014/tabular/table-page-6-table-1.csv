"Since the Police Officer who inquired into the dispute between the parties had filed the information"
"in terms of Section 66 (1) (a) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, it amply proves that there was"
"a breach of the peace threatened or likely to be threatened, which confers jurisdiction under Section"
"66 (1) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act."
"I
n this respect, it is worthy to note the Judgments by his Lordship Justice Ismail in the case of"
"Velupillai and others Vs. Sivanadan (1993) 1 SLR 123 and his Lordship Justice Wijetunga in the"
"case  of  David  Appuhamy  Vs.  Yassassi  Thero  (1987)  1  SLR  253  which  substantiate  the  said"
"position. It was held in both these cases that;"
"“Under the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, the information of the opinion as to whether"
"a breach of the peace is threatened or is likely, is left to the Police Officer inquiring"
"into the dispute.”"
"S
ince the impugned dispute between the parties is in respect of a possession of land, it is seen"
"that the applicable provision is section 68 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act. Thus, it is"
"worthy to note subsections (1) and (3) of Section 68 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act"
"state as follows;"
"1
) Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part thereof it shall be the duty of the"
"Judge of Primary Court holding the inquiry to determine as to who was in possession"
"of the land or the part on the date of filing of the information under Section 66 and make Order as"
"to who is entitled to possession of such land or part thereof."
"(3) Where at an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right to the possession of any land or any part"
"of a land, the Judge of the Primary Court is satisfied that any person who had been in possession"
"of  the  land  or  part  has  been  forcibly  dispossessed  within  a  period  of  two  months  immediately"
"before the date on which the information was filed under Section 66, he may make a determination"
"to  that effect  and make an order directing the party dispossessed be restored to  possession  and"
"prohibiting all disturbance of such possession otherwise than under the authority of an order or"
"decree of a competent Court."
