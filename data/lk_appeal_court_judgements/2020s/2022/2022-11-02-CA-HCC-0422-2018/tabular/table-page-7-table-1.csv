"and others assaulting his brother. Removing a pole from the fence nearby he"
"had  dealt  a  single  blow  to  save  his  brother  which  had  struck  on  the"
"deceased’s stomach. This evidence is clearly corroborated by the evidence of"
"PW2."
"Considering  this  evidence,  it  clearly  shows  that  the  Appellant  had  not"
"entertained a murderous intention which is a pre-requisite to find him guilty"
"to the murder charge. This has been conveniently escaped from the attention"
"of Learned Trial Judge in this case."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  after  analysing  the  evidence  given  by  both"
"parties had come to a conclusion that both actus reus and mens rea have"
"been proved by the prosecution and therefore, the Appellant is guilty to the"
"murder charge and to causing simple hurt."
"The Evidence led at the trial clearly shows that there is evidence of a sudden"
"fight. The incident had taken place close to the compound of the Appellant’s"
"mother’s house. It further shows that the deceased’s party had come under"
"the influence of liquor and went to meet Valliamma. The Appellant had come"
"to  the  scene  to  rescue  his  brother  from  the  assault.  He  had  dealt  a  blow"
"aiming at PW2 but had struck on the deceased."
"According to the medical evidence 3 non-grievous external injuries had been"
"noted on the deceased’s body. The internal injury was likely to cause death"
"but if the victim remained in hospital with proper medical attention the said"
"injury could have been cured. The JMO further stated that it was due to the"
"fact that the victim was not treated at the hospital that the injury resulted"
"in the death of the victim."
"In  this  case  although  the  evidence  presented  by  the  prosecution  and  the"
"defence manifested the availability of a plea on the basis of a sudden fight,"
"the Trial Court had failed to address its judicial mind to consider the same."
