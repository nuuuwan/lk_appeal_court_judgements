"In King v. Lewis Singho 43 NLR 491 the court held that:"
"“Where in a charge of murder the evidence discloses that the accused"
"may have committed the offence without premeditation in a sudden fight"
"in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender"
"having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner,"
"it is the duty of the Judge to direct the Jury to bring in the lesser verdict."
"……….In such a case it is immaterial which party offers the provocation"
"or commits the first assault”."
