"if the selection is to be on the basis of marks, then the scheme must be clear,"
"fair and uniform. In this case the promotions were done on the basis of marks"
"and the scheme was clear and uniform. Just because 25% of the marks were"
"allocated for personality evaluation, the scheme cannot be condemned to be"
"unfair although a scheme with a lesser percentage of marks for the personality"
"evaluation would have been fairer. Within the marking scheme the examiners"
"have a discretion in allotting 25% of marks for personality evaluation although"
"they must exercise that discretion fairly and reasonably. In this case there is no"
"evidence to show that the examiners had exercised this discretion in an unfair"
"and unreasonable manner and there is no evidence to show that the examiners"
"were biased against the Petitioners and acted maliciously towards them. Just"
"because the 1st and the 3rd Respondents had scored full marks on the basis of"
"their service one cannot come to the inevitable conclusion that they should have"
"been  given  more  marks  in  the  personality  evaluation.  Therefore,  one  cannot"
"come to the conclusion that the decision of the Respondents is ultra vires and"
"bad in law. One cannot come to the conclusion that the decision is malafide or"
"arbitrary."
"For the aforesaid reasons, we refuse to grant a mandate in the nature of a Writ"
"of Certiorari as prayed for by paragraph ‘E’ of the prayer to the petition. We also"
"refuse to grant a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus as prayed for by"
"paragraphs ‘F and G’ of the prayer to the petition. We make no order for costs."
