"marks can score high marks in the personality evaluation. There is no hard and"
"fast rule that a person who had scored high marks for the service should score"
"high marks in the personality evaluation also. That is a factor that will depend"
"on the personality of the candidate. In the same way there may be candidates"
"who had scored high marks under both those categories. That is evident by the"
"mark sheets. Although the Petitioners state that the majority of the successful"
"candidates had got through the interview  with the aid of marks obtained for"
"personality evaluation that is not an inevitable conclusion. It is apparent from"

these  huge"
"discrepancies. The situation in this case is different."
"The Petitioners had stated that there was apparent bias and/or actual bias on"
"the part of the 1st – 8th Respondents. They have also made the allegation that"
"the 1st – 8th Respondents acted malafide. But one cannot come to the conclusion"
