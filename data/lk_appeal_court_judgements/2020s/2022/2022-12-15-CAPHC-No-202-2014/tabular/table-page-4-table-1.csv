"The Respondent had pointed out to the High Court that the Petitioner had failed to produce the"
"originals  of  vital  documents.  When  perusing  the  counter  objections,  it  is  evident  that  the"
"Petitioner had failed to address the issue."
"The learned High Court Judge had observed that the Petitioner had failed to file originals or"
"certified copies of essential documents on which the Petitioner had based his application. The"
"High Court Judge had settled his order dated 17.12.201 at that point."
"Even  in  this  Court,  the  Appellant  had  failed  to  bring  to  the  notice  of  the  Court  the  crucial"
"matters. The Appellant had taken the position that by case No.24013 of the Primary Court of"
"Kandy, the Magistrate had accepted the long-term possession of the Appellant."
"Perusing  the  said  order  marked  as  [P17],  it  depicts  that  the  Magistrate  had  dismissed  the"
"application of the Petitioner in the said case No.24013 on 03.02.2004. The case was a private"
"Plaint under Section 66(1) (b) of the Primary Courts Procedure. The Petitioner, in that case, is"
"the Appellant of this case, namely Raja Senanayake Gunawardena."
"If  aggrieved  by  the  decision  in  the  Primary  Court,  the  Appellant  should  have  sought  the"
"intervention of the District Court. The Appellant had failed to furnish evidence of his litigating"
"in the District Court in the present case."
"He had spoken of mutual  partition  of the land and exchange of land.  If so, he should have"
"established his rights in the District Court when he failed at the Primary Court, which proves"
"his negligence. As to the equity maxim vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt, the law"
"assists only those who are vigilant and not those who sleep on their rights. Therefore the Court"
"cannot help when one is sleeping on his rights."
"The learned High Court Judge had correctly analysed all materials before him and concluded"
"that the Petitioner had not complied with mandatory rules. The word shall in  Rule 3(1)(a) of"
"the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules of 1990 gives no other option than to reject"
"the application for a writ to the High Court Judge."
