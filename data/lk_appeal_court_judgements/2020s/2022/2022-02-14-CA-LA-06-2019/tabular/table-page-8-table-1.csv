"Commission. If the present Quazi is of the opinion that he is unable to proceed"
"with the matter, he should obtain prior instructions from the authority (Judicial"
"Service Commission) before making the impugned order. In the circumstances,"
"the arbitrary order made by the Quazi for Colombo-West, refusing to hear the"
"application of the Petitioner is erroneous and misconceived in law."
"The Order of the Board of Quazis dated 23.02.2019"
"Having scrutinized the order of the Board of Quazis, it appears to this Court that"
"the  Board  of  Quazis  totally  failed  to  consider  the  grievous  allegations  leveled"
"against  the  previous  Quazi  by  the  Petitioner.  As  I  have  already  stated,  on  the"
"concept of fair trial, it is advisable for an adjudicator not to hear a case where"
"the parties have no faith and trust on him, even though that there are no legal"
"impediments for him to proceed with the matter. Similarly, the Board of Quazis"
"has misdirected itself that there is no provision for the Quazi of Colombo-West"
"to inform the Judicial Service Commission as to the dismissal of the Petitionerâ€™s"
"application. In terms of section 67 of the said Act, when the Quazi for Colombo-"
"West is appointed by the Judicial Service Commission to hear and determine the"
"mater, if the said Quazi is not in a position to comply with the directions of the"
"Commission,  he  is  duty  bound  to  inform  the  Commission  before  making  any"
"adverse order. Thus, the impugned order of the Board of Quazis is also bad in"
"law."
"For the foregoing reasons, I  proceed to allow the appeal with  cost fixed at Rs."
"50,000/-."
"The order of the Quazi for Colombo-East dated 08.03.2014 in case No. 117/T,"
"the order of the Quazi of Colombo-West dated 07.06.2014 in case No. 117/T"
"and 
the  order  of 
the  Board  of  Quazis  dated  23.02.2019 
in 
case  No."
"51/14/R/CMB are hereby set aside."
"The Quazi of Colombo-West is ordered to hear and determine the matter a fresh"
"in 
terms  of 
the  directions  given  by 
the 
Judicial  Service  Commission  on"
"03.04.2014."
