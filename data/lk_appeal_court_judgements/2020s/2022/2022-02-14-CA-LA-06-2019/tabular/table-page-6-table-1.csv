"The principle which emerges from bias is not concerned with the fact that the"
"decision  maker was  biased,  but  with  the possibility  that  he or  she might  have"
"been biased i.e., a real likelihood of bias [vide Simon v. Commissioner of National"
"Housing (1972) 75 NLR 471]. It is necessary to point out, however, that courts"
"will  not  merely  uphold  a  plea  of  bias  simply  because  a  party  has  raised  it.  It"
"should be made clear that a party wishing to raise a complaint of bias has to do"
"so with the adjudicator. The adjudicator is enjoined to consider such objection"
"and make a decision. Where the objection of bias has not been raised before the"
"adjudicator, the complainant has to demonstrate actual bias in the proceedings"
"on appeal or judicial review."
"Question  of  likelihood  of  bias  can  only,  logically,  be  raised  before  or  perhaps"
"during the proceedings in question. It can never be based on conjecture or on"
"flimsy insubstantial grounds and there must be material which shows a tendency"
"to favour one side unfairly at the expense of the other [vide Dr. Karunaratne v."
"A

orney General and Another (1995) 2 Sri LR 298 â€“ per Gunersekera, J at page"
"302]. In such cases, an affected party would normally be expected to request that"
"the  person  suspected  of  such  bias  recuse  himself  from  participation  in  the"
"proceedings in question. Parties may be held to have waived the right to invoke"
"the bias rule if they were fully informed of the facts that could support a claim"
"of bias but failed to raise the issue in a timely manner. Vide Canada (H.R.C.) v."
