"Constitution  and  that  therefore,  by  virtue  of 
its  constitutional  origin, 
it"
"acquires statutory force. A similar view has been taken by the Supreme Court"
"in 
the  case  of  The  Public  Services  United  Nurses  Union  V.  Montague"
"Jayawickrama, Minister of Public Administration and Others [1988]1 SLR 229,"
"that the Establishment Code has been issued by Government in the exercise"
"of the legislative power vested in the Cabinet of Ministers under article 55(4)"
"and has statutory force. Accordingly, it is apparent that the provisions under"
"the  Establishment  Code  have  statutory  force.  Hence,  the  Administrative"
"Appeals Tribunal was required under the law to comply with the Section 5:1"
"of Chapter VII of the Establishment Code unless otherwise sanctioned by law,"
"in  deciding  on  the  date  from  which  the  Petitioners  were  entitled  for  their"
"salary for the promoted post."
