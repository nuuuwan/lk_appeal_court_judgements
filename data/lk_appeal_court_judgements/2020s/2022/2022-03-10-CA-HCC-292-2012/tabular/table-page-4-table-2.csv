"","he  told  the  police  that  he  could  not  identify  the  person  who  shot  at  the"
"","deceased, Maheshwaran."
"(x)","The learned High Court Judge failed to take into account the evidence of Gananathan"
"","Nithyanandan when he stated that he cannot mention how injuries were inflicted on"
"","the deceased Maheshwaran."
"(xi)","The learned High Court Judge failed to observe that neither a gun  nor a pistol was"
"","shown to P.C Dharmasiri Perera nor Gananathan Nithiyanandan to prove the identity"
"","of the gun or pistol alleged to have been used on 01.01.2008 in the assassination of"
"","Maheshwaran."
"(xii)","The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  failed  to  observe  that  the  prosecution  had  not"
"","produced P1 (pistol) and P7 (revolver) through P.C Dharmasiri Perera or Gananathan"
"","Nithiyanandan to establish the identity of the weapon alleged to have been used in"
"","the  killing  of  Maheshwaran,  even  though  they  were  marked  when  Government"
"","Analyst Madawela gave evidence in court on 19.04.2012"
"(xiii)","The  learned  High  Court  Judge  failed  to  observe  that  the  factual  evidence  given  by"
"","Gananatham  Nithiyanadan  is  directly  in  conflict  with  evidence  given  by  Dr  Ananda"
"","Samarasekara, 
JMO  Colombo  who  stated  that  Maheshwaran  was  shot 
from  a"
"","distance  of  well  over  three  feet;  hence  the  evidence  of  Gananathan  Nithiyanathan"

"","Gananatham Nithiyanandan as an eyewitness on a comparison of his evidence with"
"","the evidence given by Dr Ananda Samarasekara J.M.O Colombo."
"(xv)","The  learned  High  Court  Judge  failed  to  take  into  account  the  evidence  of  Gamini"
"","Madawala, a Government Analyst who had given evidence on 23.04.2012; Due to his"
