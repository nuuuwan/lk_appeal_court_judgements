"","because  none  of  the  witnesses  identified  a  weapon  in  the  hand  of  the  accused-"
"","appellant on 01.01.2008."
"(xvii)","The  learned  High  Court  Judge  failed  to  observe  that  an  adverse  inference  of  guilt"
"","cannot  be  drawn  on  the  basis  that  bloodstains  found  on  the 
firearm  number"
"","0305323  originated 
from 
the 
accused-appellant, 
as 
it 
is  only 
a 
suspicious"
"","circumstance  not  sufficient  to  establish  guilt  or  to  release  the  prosecution  of  its"
"","burden  of  proving  the  case  against  the  accused-appellant  beyond  a  reasonable"
"","doubt."
"(xviii)","The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  failed  to  observe  that  bloodstains  found  on  the"
"","firearms  and  clothes  worn  by 
the  accused-appellant  were  not 
linked 
to 
the"
"","bloodstains  of 
the  deceased,  an 
item  of  evidence 
favourable 
to  be  accused-"
"","appellant."
"(xix)","The learned High Court Judge, by giving undue importance to the prosecution case,"
"","misdirected  him  by  stating  that  evidence  given  by  the  accused-appellant  did  not"
"","create  any  doubt  in  the  prosecution  case.  It  is  indeed  a  clear  misdirection  on  the"
"","burden of proof in criminal cases."
