"In  the  United  States,  jurisprudence  is  of  mixed  opinion.  The  position  can  be"
"summarised in the following passage quoted from the judgment of the United States Court"
"of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Katz 178 F.3d 368 (1999):"
"in  a  child  pornography 
“The  threshold  question  —  whether  the  age  of  a  model"
"prosecution can be determined by a lay jury without the assistance of expert testimony — must"
"be determined on a case by case basis. As the government correctly points out, it is sometimes"
"possible for the fact finder to decide the issue of age in a child pornography case without hearing"
"any expert testimony. See United States v. O’Malley, 854 F.2d 1085 (8th Cir.l988) …. However,"
"in other cases, the parties have been allowed to present conflicting expert testimony. See United"
"States v. Anderton, 136 F.3d 747, 750 (11th Cir.l998) … In yet other cases, one party presents"
"expert  testimony,  while  the  other  does  not. See United States v. Broyles, 37  F.3d  1314,  1316"
"(8th Cir.l994)(Government presented the expert testimony of a  paediatric endocrinologist and"
"Broyles  presented no  evidence.)  A case  by case  analysis will  encounter  some images  in which"
"the models are prepubescent children who are so obviously less than 18 years old that expert"
"testimony is not necessary or helpful to the fact finder. On the other hand, some cases will be"
"based  on  images  of  models  of  sufficient  maturity  that  there  is  no  need  for  expert  testimony."
"However, in this case, in which the government must prove that a model, who is post-puberty"
"but appears quite young, is less than eighteen years old, expert testimony may well be necessary"
"to “assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Fed.R.Evid."
"702.”"
"Citing  this  passage  with  approval,  the  Superior  Court  of  Pennsylvania 
in"
"Commonwealth  v.  Robertson-  Dewar  829  A.2d  1207  (2003)  observed  the  flexibility"
"inherent in the law was due to the following concern:"
"“Given  the  anonymity  of  the 
internet,  the 
identity  of  children  depicted  and  their"
"whereabouts are frequently unknown. Thus, conventional means of proving age such  as birth"
"certificates  or  testimony  of  a  relative  are  usually  unavailable.  To  require  law  enforcement"
"officials  to  track  down  and identify  the  children  depicted in  order  to  successfully  prosecute  a"
"child pornography case would rip the teeth out of the child pornography statute and destroy its"
"efficacy as a preventive measure in the sexual exploitation of children. Therefore, the legislature"
"has vested the trier of  fact with the function of determining the age of  the child depicted and"
"further  allows 
for  this  element  to  be  sufficiently  established  through  competent  expert"
"testimony in close cases.”"
"There is academic scepticism about the correctness of the approach taken in Land"
"as  well.  Alisdair  A.  Gillespie  in  an  article  titled 
‘Child  pornography’  (an  article  in"
"‘Information  &  Communications  Technology  Law’,  October  2017)  notes  that  it  appears"
