"As our jurisprudence has not dealt with the issue of proving or ascertaining the"
"age of the person depicted in the indecent material it will be of use to assess the approach"
"taken in foreign jurisdictions."
"In the United Kingdom, the case of  R v. Land [1998] 1 All ER 403, dealt with a"
"conviction for possessing indecent photographs of a child contrary to Section 1(1)(C) of the"
"Protection of Children Act 1978. There was no direct evidence about the identity or ages"
"of any of the persons in the videos. The Appellant argued, on appeal, that expert paediatric"
"evidence  should  have  been  called  before  the  jury.  The  Court  of  Appeal,  dismissing  the"
"appeal, observed that Section 2(3) of the Act which provides that for the purpose of the"
"Act “a person is taken as having been a child at any material time if it appears from the"
"evidence as a whole that he was then under the age of 16” underscores the “difficulty of"
"making  a  positive  identification  of  an  unknown  person  depicted  in  a  photograph”  and"
"therefore the age of such person is a question of fact “based on inference without any need"
"for formal proof”. The relevant portion of the judgment is worth quoting:"
"“The judge directed the jury that in deciding whether it was proved that the photographs"
"were of a child:"
"‘You  can  do  no  more  than  use  your  own  experience,  your  judgment  and  your  critical"
"faculties in deciding this issue. It is simply an issue of fact for you, the jury, to decide what you"
"have seen with your own eyes …’"
"In our judgment this direction is not open to question. In any event such expert evidence"
"tendered by either side would be inadmissible. The purpose of expert evidence is to assist the court"
"with  information  which  is  outside  the  normal  experience  and  knowledge  of  the  judge  or  jury."
"Perhaps the only certainty which applies to the problem in this case is that each individual reaches"
"puberty in his or her own time. For each the process is unique and the jury is as well placed as an"
"expert to assess any argument addressed to the question whether the prosecution has established,"
"as it must before there can be a conviction, that the person depicted in the photograph is under 16"
"years.” [emphasis added]"
"However,  there  is  doubt  whether  the  approach  taken  in  this  case  is  too  broad-"
"brush. For instance, in Griffiths (Procurator Fiscal, Perth) v. Neil Macdonald Hart [2005]"
"HCJAC 51, Lord Osborne, who delivered the opinion of the High Court of Justiciary in"
"Scotland, having cited the last paragraph quoted above observed:"
"“We must respectfully disagree with that view. In our opinion, while there may be cases in"
"which  proof  of  the  essential  facts  in  question  may  be  achieved  without  reference  to  an  expert"
"witness or witnesses, in other kinds of case, where the subject of the image may be approaching"
