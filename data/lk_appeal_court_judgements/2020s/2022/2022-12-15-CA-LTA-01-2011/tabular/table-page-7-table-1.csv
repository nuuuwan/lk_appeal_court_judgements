"the age of 16, there may be very considerable difficulty for the fact-finding tribunal in that regard."
"In such cases, the evidence of one or more expert witnesses may well be necessary in practice to"
"enable the Crown to prove that the subject of an image is under 16 years of age.”"
"However, in a recent judgment of the High Court of Justiciary, John Leadbetter v."
"Her Majesty’s Advocate [2020] HCJAC 51 it was held that “there was no need for “expert"
"evidence, that is to say a skilled witness, to prove that a photograph depicts a child.” It"
"found:"
"“There  may  be  cases  on  the  margins  in  which  little  weight  may  be  put  on  a  person’s"
"testimony that a person was a child rather than an adult; a child being a person under 18 in this"
"context (Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 ss 52(2) and 52A(4)). In such cases, the evidence of"
"a paediatrician may be advisable, if other sources, such as a birth certificate or the person’s parents"
"or other relatives, are not available. That is not to say that an adult witness, with a normal degree"
"of experience of life, cannot express a view on whether a person, whether shown in a photograph"
"or otherwise, is a child, especially if the person is naked. This is consistent with Griffiths v Hart"
"2005  SCCR  392,  Lord Osborne,  delivering  the opinion  of  the court  at  para  [15]  citing  R v  Land"
"[1999] QB 65, Judge LJ at 70-71."
"Once it is accepted, as it was in Griffiths, that the evidence of police officers was admissible"
"to  corroborate  the  evidence  of  a  paediatric  endocrinologist  as  to  the  age  of  girls  shown  in"
"photographs, that evidence must be regarded as admissible as proof that the photographs depicted"
"children."
"Whether a person appears to be a child is not a matter which requires technical or scientific"
"evidence. Identifying a person as a child is part of everyday life. It is something within common"
"knowledge and experience. A person is entitled to give evidence of his or her impression of whether"
"someone is a child and, if so, within what age range. In light of all the evidence, the fact finder"
"then has to decide whether “it appears from the evidence as a whole” that the person was under"
"eighteen (1982 Act s 52(2)). This would, in any event, be something which a sheriff or a jury could"
"do themselves by looking at the images, were that the evidential course taken.”"
"Despite this dictum, it must be noted that in Leadbetter’s case the pictures were"
"relatively  straightforward,  meaning  that  it  was  easily  identifiable  that  the  persons"
"depicted  were  children  since  all  the  children  were  below  14  years  of  age.  Further,"
"Detective James McGoldrick had been trained in categorising indecent images of children:"
"“he did have special training in identifying whether someone was a child. Despite what"
"was said in submissions both to the sheriff and to this court, he said both in chief and"
"especially in cross that his Home Office training included being able to identify someone"
"as a child.”"
