"The Respondents further contended that since a representative of the"
"Petitioner had given a sample, if at all they had any suspicion on the"
"chain of custody, the Petitioner could have made a request to the 4th"
"Respondent to re-test the sample handed over to the Petitioner, and"
"if  such  request  was  made,  the  test  could  have  been  done  in  the"
"presence  of  the  SLTB  Officers  .  However,  the  Petitioner  has  never"
"made such a request. Hence, the Respondents took the position that"
"the  Petitioner  not  making  for  such  request  itself  clearly  establishes"
"the fact that the Petitioner did not have any issues with regard to the"
"chain  of  custody, and  that  it  was  merely  fabricated  or  afterthought"
"for the purpose of this instant application."
"The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  also  sought  to"
"argue  that  the  suspension  of  registration  of  any  tea  factory  under"
"section  8(2)  of  the  Tea  Control  Act,  No.  39  of  1974  must  be  on  the"
"basis  that  the  building,  equipment  or  manner  of  operation  of  the"
"factory is not of a standard conducive to the manufacture of good tea."
"Thus,  he  took  the  position  that  there  is  no  question  or  allegation"
"about the building or equipment of the Petitioner’s factory. The only"
"allegation  is  that  sugar  has  been  added  at  some  point  to  the  tea."
"Therefore,  the  addition  of  sugar  is  not  a  matter  that  comes  within"
"section 8(2) of the Act."
"The learned Additional Solicitor General for Respondents, per contra,"
"submitted  that  the  maximum  possible  levels  sugar  in  tea  is  a  very"
"serious issue and such default is not trivial by any means. It directly"
"impacts the quality and the brand name of Ceylon tea. Accordingly,"
"the learned Additional Solicitor General for the Respondents sought"
"to  argue  that  the  suspension  of  the  Petitioner  tea  factory  had  been"
"made  in  terms  of section  8(2)(a)  as  the  Commissioner  was  satisfied"
"that the manner of operation of any tea factory is not of a standard"
