"Hence, I am inclined to accept the assertions of the Petitioners that the 4th Respondent’s"
"election and/or appointment to the post of President of SLAA for 2019/2021 is illegal and"
"any act flowing therefrom is ultra vires, null and void. In light of the above, I take the view"
"that  the  SLAA  is  not  entitled  to  allow  the  4th Respondent  to  be  elected  and/or  to  hold"
"office in SLAA as a President and/or by way of any other posts and/or to be a member of"
"the committee of the SLAA in view of ‘P17’, ‘P17a’ and ‘P17b’."
"In the circumstances, I proceed to issue a writ of Certiorari as prayed for in paragraph (d)"
"of the prayer of the Petition and also issue a writ of Prohibition as prayed for in paragraph"
"(f) of the prayer of the Petition."
