"committee appointed by the National Association of Sports, Ministry of Sports or"
"Department of Sports Development.” (Emphasis added)"
"In view of the above provisions, the Petitioners argue that the conduct on the part of the"
"4th Respondent to act as President of the SLAA and issue notice of the elective Annual"
"General Meeting to be held for the 2021/2023 SLAA committee is ultra vires since election"
"to the post of SLAA President for 2019/2021 is unlawful and also due to the fact that the"
"4th Respondent has violated ‘P11’. Anyhow, the Respondents twisting their arguments in"
"collaboration with the said amended Regulation 5(4)(g) submit that the Section 32 of the"
"Sports Law requires the issuance of a written notice under that Section to a person who is"
"holding  a  position  in  the  capacity  of  a  member  of  an  Executive  Committee  upon  been"
"convicted of violating the provisions of the said section. The Respondents’ argument is"
"that the notice under the said Section 32 should be issued against the 4th Respondent rather"
"than issuing such notice against the Sports Body for the 4th Respondent to be disqualified"
"as mentioned in the Regulation 5(4)(g)."
"On a careful examination of the said Section 32 and other provisions of the Sports Law, it"
"emanates  that  the  Minister  makes  an  order  under  Section  32  against  the  National"
"Association  of  Sports  and  not  against  any  individual/particular  office  bearer  of  such"
"Association.  The  ‘P2’  evinced  that  the  Minister  has  issued  the  said  order  as  the  then"
"management of the SLAA has acted in a non-cooperative manner and it is clear that such"
"order was not focused on one individual. Although, the provisions of Section 34 are not"
"directly relevant to this question, the scheme of those provisions are very much apt here."
"In terms of Section 34, where the Minister makes an order under Section 32 suspending"
"the registration of any National Association of Sports, the Secretary to the Ministry of the"
"Minister may, by notice in writing, require the office-bearers of such Association to deliver"
"all movable property to the Director of Sports. Any person who fails to comply with any"
"requirement imposed on him will be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction"
"to a fine. Therefore, the scheme of the provisions of the said Section is that all the office"
"bearers  are  collectively  responsible  and  are  directly  bound  by  an  order  of  the  Minister"
"issued under Section 32. Thus, I cannot accept the argument of the Respondents that a"
"notice under said Section 32 should be served individually to an office bearer in order to"
"make him disqualified under the said Regulation 5(4)(g)."
