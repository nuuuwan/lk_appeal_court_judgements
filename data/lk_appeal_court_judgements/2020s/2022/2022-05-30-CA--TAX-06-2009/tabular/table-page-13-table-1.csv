"Board of Review has observed this wavering in the Appellant’s stance in its determination"
"as well."
"Further, there is no evidence forthcoming as to how other members of the Board of"
"Directors  or  the  family  members  of  the  Appellant  benefitted  from  this  distribution  of"
"wealth. It raises a doubt then whether this point of family wealth distribution was offered"
"as a mere afterthought to escape having to pay taxes. If it was a family wealth distribution"
"then there was no necessity for the resolution to be made while the Appellant was still in"
"employment."
"The Appellant also cited the case of Craib v. CIT Sri Lanka Tax Cases Vol 1 162. In"
"the case of Craib, his Lordship Moseley J. held that “This payment I prefer to regard in the"
"light  of  a personal  gift  the  motive  for  which,  no  doubt,  but  not  the  consideration,  was  the"
"long  service  rendered  to  the  company  by  the  appellant.”  The  motive  prompting  the"
"expression  of  gratitude,  it  was  argued  may  have  been  the  Appellant’s  good  service,  but  it"
"was nevertheless a personal gift on personal grounds to provide for a holiday and to enable"
"the Appellant to recuperate his health."
"However, we cannot follow this as it is not relevant to the instant case. The motive"
"for  making  this  generous  payment  and  the  consideration  for  the  same  is  the  yeoman"
"services rendered by the Appellant."
"Instead, we are guided by the words of Rowlatt J. in Davis v. Harrison [1927] All ER"
"Rep 743 which was referred to in the case of Craib.  Rowlatt J. held,"
"“In Seymour v. Reed…. in the opinion of Lord Phillimore there is one sentence which"
"has to be considered carefully in this connection, because the learned Lord says that a gift"
"of money handed by the employer to his employee during the course of the employment, and"
"even  in  respect  of  loyal  and  meritorious  services  may  still  be  a  gift.  I  apprehend  that  the"
"question  is  always  under  that  word  ""may,""  whether  it  is  given,  because  some  further"
"remuneration  is  thought  proper  to  pay,  or whether  it  is  a gift which  springs  directly  from"
"goodwill  only,  although  that  goodwill,  of  course,  has  been  generated  by  long  association"
"with the servant during which he has rendered loyal and meritorious service. If there were"
"no  loyal  and  meritorious  service  the  goodwill  would  not  arise,  but  I  think  that  it  must"
"always be a question of fact how the particular payment is to be regarded.”"
