"arrived  at  a  conclusion  of  the  commission  being  business  income  at  the"
"hands  of  the  assessee  and  we  do  not  see  any  infirmity  or  perversity  in"
"those findings of the fact and thus we do not see any substantial question"
"of law involved in these appeals. Hence, both the appeals are dismissed”."
"[44] In my view, the facts of the present case are totally different from the facts"
"of  that  case  in  that  the  assessee  who  was  carrying  on  the  sole  business  of"
"distribution of Acer products, upon agreement entered with M/s. Acer India"
"Pvt.  Ltd.,  transferred  its  sole  business  of  distribution  of  Acer  products  to"
"SIL,  and  received  a  commission  from  SIL.  In  contrast,  the  business  of  the"
"Appellant  consists  in  the  receipts  of  several  other  business  income  and  the"
"Appellant  has  declared 
its  profits  and 
income 
from  different 
sources."
"Accordingly, 
the  decision 
in  Commissioner  of 
Income  Tax 
v  FX 
Info"
"Technologies (Pvt) Ltd ITA will not support the Appellant’s case."
"[45] The  Appellant further relied  on  the decision  in  Thornhill v.  Commissioner"
"of  Income  Tax,  Reports  of  Ceylon  Tax  Cases  Vol.  1,  CTC 180.In Thornhill v."
"The Commissioner of Income Tax (supra), the main question was whether the"
"sum  of  Rs.  19,622.19  was  received  by  the  Appellant  in  respect  of  his  estate"
"under  the  Tea  and  Rubber  Control  Ordinance  as  tea  and  rubber  coupons  to"
"which  he  was  entitled  under  the  said  Ordinance,  and  realised  by  the  sale  of"
"these coupons constituted profit or income within the meaning of Section 6 (1)"
"(a) or 6  (1) (b) of  the Income Tax  Ordinance,  1932 or whether it  represented"
"realisation of capital."
"[46]  Soertsz,  J.,  in  that  case  referred  to  the  statement  made  in  Tennant  v."
"Smith (1892) A.C. 150 that “for income tax purposes, ‘income’ “must be money"
"or something capable of being turned into money”. Soertsz, J., held, however,"
"that  this  statement  needs  qualification  as  all  money  and  all  things  capable  of"
"being 
turned 
into  money  are  not  necessarily 
“income” 
for 
tax  purposes."
"Soertsz,  J., 
referred 
to 
the 
following  essential  characteristics  of 
“income”"
"identified  by  Cunningham  and  Dorland  in  their  Treatise  on  Land  and  Income"
"Tax  and  Practice,  at  p.  128  and  held  that  these  essential  elements  provide"
"adequate tests by which to ascertain whether a particular receipt is “income” or"
"not, within the meaning of the Income Tax Ordinance:"
