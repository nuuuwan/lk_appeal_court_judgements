"its own brand name on its subsidiary’s tiles for the purpose of reselling them"
"with its new brand name, through the customer channels of the Appellant."
"[75] Under this arrangement between the parties, it is immaterial for the local"
"seller  (Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd)  whether  the  goods  were  in  fact  used  for"
"exports or not, as long its products are  promoted or handled or sold through"
"the  Appellant’s  sales  channels  and  customer  base.  It  is  immaterial  for  the"
"Appellant  whether  the  purchases  made  from  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Pvt  are"
"used to fulfil its local orders or export orders as long as the Appellant is able"
"to  use  its  own  brand  name  on  tiles  manufactured  by  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe"
"Ltd, and earn profits former-selling them with its own brand name through its"
"outlets and market channels."
"[76]  If  the  Appellant  however,  claimed  that  the  export  profits  are  part  and"
"parcel  of  its  business  income,  the  Appellant  should  have  produced  separate"
"accounts  to  identify  such  sales  which  were  made  by  the  Appellant  to  third"
"parties through the Appellant’s sales outlets and channels, and that the sales"
"were  made  from  purchases  for  export  purposes.  Had  it  produced  separate"
"accounts,  the  Assessor  could  have  identified  the  balance  part  of  its  sales"
"which had been used for sales locally, when its case is that the commission is"
"not related to the entire purchases made from Lanka Waltile Meepe Ltd."
"[
77]  Accordingly, 
the  commission 
income  referred 
to 
in 
the  Board  Paper"
"covers  all  purchases  made  by  the  Appellant  from  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd,"
"for  which  a  commission  of  5%  was  paid  by  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd.  as"
"correctly decided by the Assessor and confirmed by the TAC."
"[78]  In  the  circumstances,  “local  sales”  must  mean  an  intra-state  transaction"
"which covers all purchases made by the Appellant from Lanka Walltile Meepe"
"Ltd,  for  sale  in  the  local  market  and  for  export.  In  the  present  case,  the"
"Appellant has not satisfied that the commission income was received only for"
"the 
sales  made  by 
its 
sales  outlets  and 
channels.  Accordingly, 
the"
"commission  income  referred  to  in  the  Board  Paper  applies  to  all  purchases"
"made  by  the  Appellant  from  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd,  and  the  Appellant"
"received  the  commission  for  all  purchases  from  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd,"
"including for those exported."
"Paragraph  1  of  the  written  submissions  filed  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  on"
"01.10.2018 reads as follows:"
"“The  Appellant 
is 
also 
engaged 
in 
the 
business 
of 
selling 
titles"
"manufactured  by  its  subsidiary  company,  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  (Pvt)  Ltd"
"for which a commission of 5% on the gross value of local sales is paid to"
"the Appellant as part of its principal business activities”."
"[79] The Appellant’s main business activities of manufacturing and marketing"
"of  ceramic  wall  tiles  for  export  and  local  market  fall  within  the  ambit  of  its"
"business under section 3(1)(a) of the Inland Revenue Act. In addition to such"
"main  business  activities,  the  Appellant  purchased  tiles  from  its  subsidiary"
