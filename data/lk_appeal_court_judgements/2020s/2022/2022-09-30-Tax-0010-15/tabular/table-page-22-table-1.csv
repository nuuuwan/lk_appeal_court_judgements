"[65] Based on the Appellant’s written submission, it is clear that only a part of"
"the sales from Lanka Walltile Meepe Ltd. has been exported by the Appellant"
"and the other part would have fallen into local sales of Lanka Walltile Meepe"
"that 
the  entire 
Ltd.  The  Appellant’s  statement  of  account  merely  states"
"purchases  had  been  used 
for 
indirect  exports 
(Rs.  167,877,250)  which"
"contradicts  the  Appellant’s  own  admission  in  the  written  submission  that  the"
"purchased  wall  tiles  were  used  to  fulfill  part  of  its  export  orders.  In  this"
"circumstance,  the  Appellant  should  have  maintained  separate  account  and"
"identified the part of the purchases used for export orders and the other part"
"used  for  local  orders,  but  the  Appellant  has  failed  to  identify  the  part  of  the"
"purchases  used  for  export  market  and  the  other  part  used  for  local  market,"
"when  its  case  is  that  the  commission  is  not  related  to  the  entire  purchases"
"made from Lanka Walltile Meepe Ltd."
"[66]  The  Appellant,  however,  argued  that  no  commission  is  payable  by  the"
"seller  to  the  buyer  in  buying  its  own  goods  and  therefore,  no  commission"
"income  was  received  by  the  Appellant  on  account  of  these  purchases  from"
"Lanka Walltiles  Meepe  Ltd.   The  Appellant further argued  that  in purchasing"
"tiles  from  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd,  it  has  not  rendered  any  of  the  services"
"mentioned in the board paper, and accordingly, no commission is involved in"
"respect of those purchases."
"[67]  The  board  paper  provides  that  the  commission  of  5%  was  paid  to  the"
"Appellant on its local sales gross value for three stated reasons as set out in"
"paragraph 55 of this judgment.  It is not in dispute that Lanka Walltile Meepe"
"Ltd has sold tiles manufactured by Lanka Walltile Meepe Ltd to the Appellant"
"as  set  out  in the  invoices  pertaining  to  sales  (pp14-44  of the TAC brief) and"
"the  question  is  whether  such  purchases  attract  local  sales  referred  to  in  the"
"board paper for which the commission was received by the Appellant."
"[68] The question also arises whether the phrase “local sales” is restricted to"
"commission  paid  for  selling  tiles  manufactured  by  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd"
"for  the  purpose  of  selling  them  to  third  parties,  through  the  Appellant’s  own"
"channels and  sales outlets.  In  this  context, it  is necessary  to understand  the"
"nature  of 
the  commercial  arrangement  between 
the  Appellant  and 
its"
"subsidiary  company,  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd,  and 
the 
factors  and 
the"
"circumstances that motivated the parties to earn a profitable income  through"
"this transaction, in addition to its core business activities."
"[69]  According  to  the Board Paper dated  24.10.2008, a  sales  commission of"
"5%  is  to  be  paid  by  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd,  to  Lanka Walltile  PLC  on  its"
"local sales gross value for (a) using Lanka Walltile brand; (b) handling and"
"promoting  sales  through  the  Appellant’s  sales  channels;  and  (c)  using  the"
"customer  base  of 
the  Appellant.  Though 
the  Appellant  claims 
that 
the"
"commission income (49,733,000) was received for selling tiles manufactured"
"by  Lanka  Walltile  Meepe  Ltd  through  its  local  outlets  to  third  parties,  as  its"
