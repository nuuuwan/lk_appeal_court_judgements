"It is up to the Appellant to give evidence or not. His silence without giving evidence himself is not"
"a  bar for him to call witnesses. The law requires that if he opts to give evidence, he must give"
"evidence first."
"F
or this inquiry to be fair, the Appellant should have had the opportunity to call his witness and"
"establish his  defence. According to  the letter of  the Secretary, there is  no barrier  to calling  the"
"witnesses; even though they are official witnesses, the decision of calling or not was in the hand"
"of the inquiring officer. This denial is fatal."
"A
s for recording the evidence of his wife should not have been allowed. The Evidence Ordinance"
"has  stipulated  when  a  spouse  can  be  called  a  witness.  Though  the  inquiring  Officer  is  not"
"knowledgeable about the Evidence Ordinance, it is common knowledge that a spouse's evidence"
"is usually tainted. Even though the Respondents  (1-7 and the 9th ] argue that this is a domestic"
"inquiry, the Evidence Ordinance does not apply. One must keep in mind that there is a punishment"
"at the end of the domestic inquiry. That is why even a domestic inquiry should not only be fair,"
"but it should seem to be fair."
"The  wife's  evidence  was  indeed  limited.  Appellant  or  his  representative  did  not  object  to  her"
"evidence was also stressed on behalf of the contesting Respondents. They argue that the Appellant"
"is now estopped from taking advantage of his wife giving evidence."
"Even though a layman was in charge of the proceedings, inquiring Officer should have inquired"
"whether there was an objection to calling the wife."
"H
owever, this point was not discussed by the High Court judge. A judicial officer must consider"
"every aspect, especially when they are pleaded. Even if a particular point is not argued, the judge"
"must consider, evaluate, and answer if that point is essential. Calling the wife, especially when a"
"divorce case is pending, should have been considered by the High Court Judge. To the naked eye"
"calling a spouse as a witness against the other spouse in any inquiry is beyond reason. Even in a"
"court of law, a spouse is called only in instances provided for in Evidence Ordinance."
