"Rs. 13,072,012 for the year 2016/17 (X5). Since the Petitioners failed to pay"
"the ESC as stipulated in X5, the 2nd Respondent had issued a notice dated"
"28-08-2019 (X6) to the Petitioners stating that the Petitioners had defaulted"
"in  paying  the  ESC 
for  the  said  period.  Thereupon,  the  Petitioners  had"
"submitted a cheque dated 05-10-2020 marked as X6C to the Department of"
"Inland Revenue for the amount due as ESC. Subsequently, before realising"
"the said cheque, the Petitioners instituted the instant application before this"
"Court on 20-01-2020."
"In this scenario, the learned Counsel for the Petitioners submits that in terms"
"of the Economic Service Charge (Amendment) Act, No. 7 of 2017, a liability to"
"pay  only  accrues  only  with  effect 
from  01-04-2017,  and  therefore,  the"
"Petitioners are not liable to pay ESC for the year of assessment 2016/17. As"
"such, the Petitioners state that the assessment notice marked X5 and the Tax"
"in default notice marked X6 are ultra-vires, unlawful and arbitrary."
"When the matter was taken up for support, the learned Additional Solicitor"
"General who is appearing for the Respondent raised a preliminary objection"
"as to the maintainability of this application, which reads thus;"
