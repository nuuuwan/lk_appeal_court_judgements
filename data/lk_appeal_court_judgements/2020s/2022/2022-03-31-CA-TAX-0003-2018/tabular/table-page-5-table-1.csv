"ii. the carrying on, or carrying out of;"
"iii. a taxable activity"
"Arguments"
"The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that VAT is not charged"
"on every supply made by a registered person. It has to be a taxable supply."
"It was also submitted that every taxable supply is not subject to VAT. For"
"a taxable supply to be subject to VAT, the supply has to be made ‘in the"
"course of the carrying on, or carrying out, of a taxable activity’."
"The learned Counsel contrasted Section 2 (2) of the Finance Act 1972 of"
"the United Kingdom and Section 8 of the GST Act in New Zeeland, with"
"Section  2 (1) (a)  of the  Sri Lankan Act. The learned Counsel submitted"
"that,  initially,  in  the  relevant  provision  of  the  VAT  Act  in  the  United"
"Kingdom, the phrase used was ‘in the course of a business carried on by"
"him’ which is very much similar to the language used in our VAT Act, and"
"subsequently, the Legislature in the United Kingdom introduced the word"
"‘furtherance’ to enlarge the scope of VAT liability so that it then read ‘in"
"the  course  or  furtherance  of  any  business  carried  on  by  him’.  It  was"
"submitted that the GST Act in the New Zealand also contain the words ‘in"
"the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on’. The learned"
"Counsel submitted that the VAT Act in the Sri Lanka was enacted having"
"regard to the corresponding laws applicable in the United Kingdom VAT"
"Act  and  the  New  Zeeland  GST  Act.  Accordingly,  the  learned  Counsel"
"strenuously  argued  that  since  the  Legislature  has  deliberately  avoided"
"using  the  words  ‘furtherance  of’  in  the  Sri  Lankan  VAT  Act,  fringe"
"activities have not been made subject to VAT."
"Thereafter,  the  learned  Counsel  proceeded  to  argue  that  the  Appellant’s"
"main business is the manufacture and sale of load cells and therefore, the"
"only taxable supply made by the Appellant ‘in the course of the carrying"
"on, or carrying out, of a taxable  activity’ is the supply and sale of load"
"cells."
