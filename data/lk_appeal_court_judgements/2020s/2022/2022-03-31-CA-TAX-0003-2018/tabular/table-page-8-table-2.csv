"Appellant. The Appellant’s authorised representative himself admitted this"
"fact in the  appeal preferred to  the TAC.6  The  account statements of the"
"Appellant company also establish this fact.7"
"The Appellant’s contention is that it has been paying the salaries to both"
"the  employees  of  the  Appellant  and 
its  sister  company  Straintec  for"
"administrative convenience. The Appellant has received the same amount"
"from  Straintec  as  reimbursement  for  expenses 
incurred  on  behalf  of"
"Straintec.8 The Respondent has not rejected this proposition. This has been"
"acknowledged  by  the  Assessor  in  his  letter  of  intimation,9  and  by  the"
"CGIR’s  representative  at 
the 
interview.10  However, 
the  Respondent’s"
"contention  was  that  reimbursement  of  salaries  paid  by  the  Appellant"
"constitutes a consideration received for a taxable supply.11 The Appellant,"
"quite contrary to the submissions made before this Court, has conceded that"
"the  reimbursement  of  expenses  is  a  taxable  supply.12  However,  it  has"
"contended that the said supply is not made in the course of carrying on or"
"carrying out of a taxable activity. In the written submissions made to this"
"Court, the Appellant contended that although a reimbursement of expenses"
"is  liable  for  VAT  where  there  is  a  supply  of  services,  reimbursement"
"without a supply is not VAT liable.13"
