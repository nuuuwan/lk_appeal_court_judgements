"of assets whereas the case in hand involves an insurance indemnity for a"
"damaged capital asset, but by the Appellant’s own submission above, these"
"two are to be treated as equivalent. There is no information in the appeal"
"brief  for this Court to conclude that the vehicle for which the insurance"
"indemnity was paid, was used for any purpose other than the purposes of"
"the business itself. Furthermore, the learned Counsel for the Appellant did"
"not explain in argument what exactly the vehicle was used for. For these"
"reasons,  and  relying  on  the  equivalence  of  facts  that  the  Appellant  has"
"advocated for, I see no need to distinguish between H. B. Mattia Ltd and"
"the case in hand."
"The Appellant has raised the fourth question of law on the ground that the"
"TAC had erred in law in relying on the decision of H. B. Mattia Ltd, a case"
"based on the Finance Act 1972 of the United Kingdom, where the words"
"‘furtherance of’ are used which are not in the VAT Act in Sri Lanka. I have"
"already dealt with the differences of these words above in this judgment"
"and held otherwise. Moreover, it appears to me that the words considered"
"in the said judgment were not the aforesaid words but the words ‘supply in"
"the course of a business carried on’ which words are almost identical to"
"the words ‘in the course of the carrying on, ………a taxable activity’ used"
"in the Sri Lankan VAT Act."
"Therefore,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  TAC  did  not  err  in  following  the"
"decision of H. B. Mattia Ltd, since it has a persuasive value, though not"
"binding in our jurisdiction."
"Above  all,  I  need  not  labour  much  on  this  matter  since  our  statutory"
"provisions are  clear on this issue. The words  ‘supply of services’  as per"
"Section 83 of the VAT Act stand for  ‘any supply which is not supply of"
"goods but includes any loss incurred in a taxable activity for which an"
"indemnity is due’ (emphasis added). Furthermore, a ‘taxable activity’ is"
"defined as:"
"(a)  any  activity  carried  on  as  a  business,  trade,  profession  or  vocation"
"other than in the course of employment or every adventure or concern in"
"the nature of a trade;"
"(b) … (emphasis added)."
"Therefore, it appears that the disposal of capital assets used for the purpose"
"of the business falls within the definition of ‘taxable activity’, and therefore"
