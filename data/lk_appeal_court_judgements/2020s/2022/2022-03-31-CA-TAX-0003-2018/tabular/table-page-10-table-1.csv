"of record (at page 6 of the appeal brief) Straintec is named as a subsidiary"
"of the Appellant."
"At this stage, I must admit that a doubt arises in my mind as to why the"
"salaries of the employees of Straintec were paid by the Appellant. More"
"specifically, why were only the salaries paid. Being two different entities,"
"Straintec would have had its own administrative mechanism. In fact, the"
"Assessor, exercising his powers under Section 21 (4) of the VAT Act could"
"easily have called for the letters of appointment of the employees etc., and"
"cleared any doubt as to whether the Appellant had, in effect, supplied their"
"employees to Straintec and got a reimbursement for the services supplied"
"by the Appellant to Straintec. However, the Assessor has failed to exercise"
"such powers with due diligence. Therefore, at this stage of the case, the"
"only  reasonable  inference  that  this  Court  could  draw  on  the  available"
"material is to accept the version of the Appellant that they had paid the"
"salaries of the employees of Straintec for administrative convenience and"
"later received a reimbursement."
"In the circumstances, quite contrary to the case of Heart of Variety, in the"
"case in hand, the employees of Straintec have supplied their services not to"
"the Appellant, but to their own employer Straintec. Therefore, the dicta in"
"Heart of Variety have no persuasive value in deciding the case in hand and"
"holding that the Appellant has supplied a service for a consideration, and"
"been later reimbursed by Straintec."
"On the above analysis, I am of the view that the TAC has erred in law in"
"relying on the decision in the case of Heart of Variety and holding that the"
"sum  of  Rs.  31,491,313  received  by  the  Appellant  is  consideration  for  a"
"taxable supply of services made to Straintec by the Appellant."
"I therefore answer the first and second questions of law in the affirmative."
"I will now consider the third and fourth questions of law together."
