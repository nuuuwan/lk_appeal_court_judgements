"","prompted 
the  victim’s  parents 
to  make 
this 
false"
"","complaint.  The 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
further"
"","submitted  that,  the  delay  of  about  eleven  months  to"
"","make the complaint to the police, affects the credibility"
"","of  the  victim  and  therefore  it  is  unsafe  to  convict  the"
"","appellant  based  on  the  uncorroborated  testimony  of"
"","the victim."
"6.","The 
learned 
State 
Counsel 
for 
the 
respondent"
"","submitted that, the delay of eleven months to make the"
"","complaint to the police has been well explained by the"
"","prosecution  witnesses.  He  further  submitted  that,  in"
"","his  unsworn  statement  from  the  dock,  the  appellant"
"","has  not  taken  up  the  position  that  the  land  dispute"
"","prompted the false complaint."
"7.","The  delay 
in  making  a  complaint  may  affect 
the"
"","credibility of a witness. It is important to note that, the"
"","victim in this case was 10 years of age at the time she"
"","was  subjected  to  sexual  abuse.  Therefore,  one  cannot"
"","expect a child who is 10 years of age to go to the police"
"","station alone and make a complaint. However, she has"
"","informed  her  father  soon  after  he  came  home.  It  is"
"","evident that, it was the father who observed the change"
"","in  behaviour  of  the  child  and  questioned  her.  Being  a"
"","child who is 10 years of age, she may have been scared"
"","or even felt  guilty  to  complain  to  the  father before  she"
"","was questioned. In a village setting, in cases relating to"
"","sexual  abuse,  the  blame  mostly 
falls  on  the  victim"
"","especially if the victim is a girl. However, in law, a child"
"","victim  is  not  considered  mature  enough  to  consent  to"
"","sexual  activities.  Further,  the  pattern  of  behaviour  of"
"","the  parents  in  a  village  setting  is  clearly  seen  in  this"
"","incident,  as  both  parents  have  smacked 
the  child"
"","initially  for  no  fault  of  her  own.  Therefore,  in  most"
"","instances  children  are  compelled  to  keep  such  sexual"
"","abuse  to  themselves  without  informing  the  adults  in"
"","the 
family. 
In 
this 
instance,  she  has  revealed
