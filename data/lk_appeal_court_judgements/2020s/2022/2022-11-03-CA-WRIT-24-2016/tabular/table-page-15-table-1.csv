"In this instance, the Petitioner has waited for nearly eight years to claim succession for the land"
"that his father had possessed by way of a grant. Hence the objection to delay succeeds. We observe"
"that when he finally decided to stake his claim, he finds that his father had surrendered the grant"
"back to the state."
"Land grants executed by the President"
"The Respondents also raised an objection under Article 35 of the Constitution, the grants are given"
"by the President, thus this Court has no jurisdiction under Article 35 to issue a writ as prayed for"
"by the Petitioner, especially pertaining to the land grants already executed by the President under"
"the powers vested in the Constitution."
"It is the contention of the Respondents that  the 1st to 4th Respondents have no authority to issue"
"permits  or grants and  the  said grants under the  Land Development Ordinance are issued  by the"
"President."
"1st  to  5th  Respondents  contended  that  the  Petitionerâ€™s  application  has  to  fail  as  the  land  the"
"Petitioner  is  claiming  after  it  was  vested  with  the  state,  had  been  given  to  the  6th  7th,  and  8th"
"Respondents by a Presidential Grant. Thus, the objection under Article 35 that this Court is not"
"empowered to grant the reliefs prayed for, succeeds."
"It  is  further  contended  that  if  the  Petitioner  so  wished  to  challenge  the  grants  issued  by  the"
"President, then he should have invoked the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as the Constitution"
"has specifically conferred jurisdiction on the Supreme Court."
"Accordingly, for the aforesaid reasons stated in this Judgment, this Court is not inclined to grant"
"the reliefs sought by the Petitioner, and the application is dismissed without cost."
