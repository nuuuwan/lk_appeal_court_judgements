"The 5th Respondent in his written submission contends the said grants had been issued considering"
"the intention of Siripala when he surrendered the grant pursuant to R1 and R2. The surrendering"
"of the land  happened during the  lifetime  of Siripala and it  had  been accepted  by the Divisional"
"Secretary also during the lifetime of Siripala. Hence it is the contention of the 5th Respondent, that"
"once Siripala surrendered the grant to the state, all the rights /title to the said parcel of the land is"
"reverted back to the state without any encumbrance. Thus, from that date, the land reverts to the"
"state any nominations and or any sequence of succession that would have been, are extinguished."
"This leaves the Petitioner with no legal right, let alone a legal right to seek a writ of mandamus."
"The Petitioner in response argued that though the land was surrendered before it could be entered"
"into the land registry, the said Siripala had died. However, he failed to disclose that the Divisional"
"Secretary had accepted the said land on the same day which is before the death of Siripala. It is"
"pertinent to note that once the grantee surrenders his grant and it is accepted by the representative"
"of the  state, in this case, the Divisional  Secretary, the right  to  succession,  which the  Petitioner"
"claims comes to an end."
