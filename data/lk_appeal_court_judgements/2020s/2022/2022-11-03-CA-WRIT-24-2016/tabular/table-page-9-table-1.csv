"motives from exercising a power which is his duty to exercise. The Court will issue a Mandamus"
"to do what he should do."
"Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka Vs Messrs Jafferiee & Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd (2005) 2"
"SLR 89 where it was held, “There is rich and profuse case law on Mandamus on the conditions"
"to  be  satisfied  by  the  Applicant.  Some  of  the  conditions  precedents  the  issue  of  Mandamus"
"appear to be:"
"(a)  The  Applicant  must  have  a  legal  right  to  the  performance  of  a  legal  duty  by  the  parties"
"against whom the Mandamus is sought (R v Barnstaples Justices)"
"(b) The right to be enforced must be a “Public Right” and the duty sought to be enforced must"
"be of a public nature."
"(c) The legal right to compel must reside in the Applicant himself (R v Lewisham Union)"
"(d) The application must be made in good faith and not for an indirect purpose"
"(e) The application must be preceded by a distinct demand for the performance of the duty"
"(f) The person or body to whom the writ is directed must be subject to the jurisdiction of the"
"court issuing the writ."
"Thus, in our view, the Petitioner has failed to establish his legal right for the relief he claims."
