"recommended as follows;"
"a)  “Since  a  letter  has  been  issued  by  the  authorities  discontinuing  the  transport"
"allowance paid to Mr. Vishvajith from February 2021, it is an indecent act to obtain"
"such  allowance  from  February  to  October  2021.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  a"
"disciplined officer to adhere to the decisions made by his superior although such"
"decisions are unfair”."
"b)  “It  is  recommended  to  acquit  Mr.  Vishvajith  from  all  the  other  charges  and  to"
"reinstate  him  in  the  same  position  whilst  issuing  a  warning  letter  to  avoid  him"
"repeating such acts in future”."
"c)  “Decision to recover the allowances that were paid during last 10 months is against"
"the rule of natural justice and the circulars; and it is favourable for both parties to"
"pay the transport allowance to Mr. Vishvajith as opted by him earlier”."
"d)  “It  should  be  understood  that  it  is  favourable  for  both  parties  to  let  bygones  be"
"bygones  and  come  in  to  terms  with  their  differences  and  continue  work  in  a"
"peaceful manner”."
