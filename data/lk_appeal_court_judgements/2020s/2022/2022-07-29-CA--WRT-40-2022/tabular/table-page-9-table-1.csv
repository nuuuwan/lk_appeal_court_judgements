"There is no provision in the said Circular which restricts, impliedly or expressly, an officer"
"using his discretion to opt either to use the official vehicle or to receive such allowances."
"The  Secretaries  to  Ministries  or  the  Chairmen  of  Commercial  Corporations,  Statutory"
"Boards and Government Owned Companies to whom this Circular is being addressed also"
"have not been bestowed with any authority in terms of the said Circular to compel any"
"officer to select a particular option in line with the wish of such Secretary/Chairman/Head"
"of  the  Institution.  I  have  arrived  at  the  said  finding  as  the  said  Circular  is  based  on  a"
"Government policy and is issued by the Ministry of Finance which has a prime duty and"
"a responsibility than the said Chairman/Head of the Institution to consider the financial"
"constraints, if any, due to the implementation of this Circular."
"Thus, I take the view that the PED is empowered to give an interpretation at any point of"
"time  on  the  aforesaid  discretion  of  an  officer  in  respect  of  the  said  Clause  3.3  and  it  is"
"obvious that during the period relevant to the instant application, the said Department has"
"not issued any special interpretation upon the said discretion. It is pertinent to note that"
"the Director General of PED is the 18th Respondent of this application and the Attorney"
"General  who  appears  for  the  PED  and  also  for  the  15th  and  16th  Respondents  filing   a"
"motion dated 20.04.2022, has informed Court that no objections would be filed in respect"
"of  the  instant  application  of  the  Petitioner.  In  the  circumstances,  I  hold  that  the  said"
"Chairman has no authority whatsoever to discriminate an officer when using his or her"
"discretion  under  the  said  Clause  3.3  of  the  Circular.  The  said  Chairman  among  other"
"decisions particularly in his decision reflected in ‘P33’, has clearly oppressed the discretion"
"of the Petitioner, impeding him from exercising such discretion at his pleasure."
"Now,  I  advert  to  examine  whether  the  services  of  the  Petitioner  have  been  terminated"
"unlawfully. The Petitioner has been serving at CIDA as the Director (Finance) until his"
"services  were  terminated  with  effect  from  08.10.2021.  The  Respondents  do  not  dispute"
"that the Petitioner is an eligible officer under the Public Administration Circular 22/99,"
"dated 08.10.1999, marked ‘P25C’ to avail the benefits in terms of the said PED Circular"
"01/2015  as  amended  by  PED  Circular  01/2015  (i).  The  PED  also  has  not  made  any"
"direction during the period relevant to this case that a probationer is not entitled to the"
"benefits under the said clause 3.3 of the said Circular. In any event, I am of the view that"
"the benefits under the said clause 3.3 are being given to officers for them to execute official"
