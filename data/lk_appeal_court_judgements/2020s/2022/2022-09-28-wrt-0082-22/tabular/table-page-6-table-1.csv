"Petitioner is premature. In the circumstances, we take the view that the Petitioner has failed"
"to submit an arguable case and prima facie there is no merit in this application."
"It is observed that the manner in which the prayer of the Petition has been formulated and the"
"alleged contents of the body of the Petition do not warrant the Petitioner to duly challenge"
"the composition of the respective selection committee in the instant application."
"At the threshold stage of a judicial review application, as established by several judgements,"
"the  Court  must  be satisfied  that  there  is  a serious  case  to  be  heard  and  on  the  facts  before"
"Court there is a probability that the Petitioner is entitled to relief.  The vitiating ground must"
"be arguably material to the impugned decision and such decision must be arguably amenable"
"to  judicial  review.  (See-Jinadasa  vs.  Weerasinghe  31  NLR  33  and  R  vs.  Chief  Rabbi  ex.  p."
"Wachmann (1993) 2 All ER 249)"
"In light of the above, we are of the view that the Petitioner has failed to submit a prima facie"
"case which warrants this Court to issue formal notice of this application on the Respondents."
"Accordingly, we proceed to refuse this application."
