"only issue now is whether PW-1's description of sexual acts is only an",""
"exaggeration,  as  the  learned  DSG  claims.  According  to  the  “Oxford",""
"dictionary”,  the  meaning  of  “exaggeration”  is  that  “a  statement  that",""

"the  “Cambridge  dictionary”  the  meaning  of  “exaggeration”  is  that  “to",""
"make something seem larger, more important, better or worse than it",""
"really is”. So, it is apparent that in the instant action, PW-1 should see",""
"or feel something to exaggerate in respect of the sexual acts. PW-1 could",""
"not explain any sexual act committed by the appellant or feel anything",""
"because she was fast asleep and could not remember or was unaware",""
"of what had occurred according to her own evidence. She could have",""
"exaggerated  the  sexual  acts  only  if  she  was  in  a  position  to  see  and",""
"remember  the  sexual  acts  committed  by  the  appellant.  When  she",""
"categorically  stated","that  she  could  not  remember  anything  after"
"drinking  water  and falling  fast  asleep,  according  to  her  own  evidence",""
"she was incapable to explain any sexual act occurred. Therefore, this is",""
"certainly not an exaggeration but a serious improbability that directly",""
"affects the credibility of the witness.",""
