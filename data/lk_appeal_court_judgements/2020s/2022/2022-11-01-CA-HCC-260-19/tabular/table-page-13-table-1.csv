"evidence  is  not  only  improbable  but  also  inconsistent  as  explained"
"above. It is vital to be noted that the inconsistency and improbability"
"have been occurred on the most important incidents in proving charges"
"of this case."
"Therefore, I regret that I am unable to agree with the contention of the"
"learned  DSG 
that 
the  sexual  acts  she  described  were  only  an"
"exaggeration and those items of evidence do not affect the credibility of"
"PW-1.  The  said  major 
inconsistencies  as  well  as 
the  significant"
"improbabilities  have  a  direct 
impact  on 
the  credibility  of  PW-1's"
"evidence. Hence, her evidence cannot be considered as convincing and"
"the credibility of the prosecutrix is in question for the reasons explained"
"above. As stated in the aforesaid Court of Appeal Case No. 129/2002,"
"the prosecutrix’s evidence should be completely satisfactory to act upon"
"but PW-1’s evidence in this case, cannot be considered as satisfactory"
"evidence. In these circumstances, I am of the view that it is unsafe to"
"act upon the prosecutrix’s evidence in this case. Hence, I hold that the"
"learned High Court Judge’s conclusion that the charge of statutory rape"
"has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt is erroneous."
"For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the second count of statutory rape"
"has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The first count against"
"the  appellant  in  terms  of  section  436  of  the  Penal  Code  is  house"
"trespass in order to commit any offence punishable with imprisonment"
"for  10  years  or  more.  The  first  count  has  been  brought  against  the"
"appellant  for  house-trespass  in  order  to  commit  the  offence  of  rape."
"Since  the  second  charge  of  statutory  rape  fails,  the  first  charge  also"
"necessarily  fails.  Hence,  I  hold  that  the  learned  High  Court  judge’s"
"decision to convict the accused-appellant for counts one and two is bad"
"in law."
