"In  her  arguments  before  this  Court,  although  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"appellant attempted to portray that the incident spoken of by the appellant in"
"his dock statement and the evidence of the PW-01 refers to one and the same"
"incident, I find no basis to agree with such a contention. As pointed out correctly"
"by the learned DSG, the evidence of PW-01 which was never challenged, shows"
"abundant  proof  that  it  was  the  appellant  who  confronted  the  deceased  by"
"abusing  him,  and  thereafter  attacking  him.  The  evidence  shows  that  the"
"deceased was never the aggressor. The evidence also shows that the appellant"
"has  come  prepared  because  he  used  the  knife  carried  by  him  to  attack  the"
"deceased.  According  to  the  postmortem  report,  the  deceased  had  received  12"
"injuries out of which ten are cut wounds while the other two are stab wounds."
"This  goes  on  to  establish  that  the  deceased  has  acted  with  the  intention  of"
"causing bodily injury to the deceased causing his death."
"For  the  reasons  as  considered  above,  I  find  no  reasons  to  interfere  with  the"
"conviction and the sentence of the appellant by the learned High Court Judge."
"The appeal therefore is dismissed as it is devoid of any merit. The conviction and"
"the sentence affirmed."
