"1.  “Though  the  accused  appellant  in  his  defence  did  not  take  up  the"
"defence of grave and sudden provocation, the Trial Judge must consider"
"such a plea in favour of the appellant if it emanates from the evidence"
"of the prosecution."
"2.  Failure on the part of the petitioner or his Counsel to take up a certain"
"line of defence does not relieve a Judge of the responsibility of putting"
"to the jury such defence if it arises on the evidence.”"
