"In Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v. Shanmugam [1995] 1 SLR 55"
"His Lordship Ranaraja, J held;"
"â€œSuperior  courts  of this  country  have  held  that  relief  by way  of"
"restitution in integrum in  respect of judgments  of original  courts  may be  sought"
"where  (a)  the judgments  have  been  obtained  by fraud, (Abeysekera-supra),  by"
"the production of false evidence,  (Buyzerv.Eckert), or non-disclosure of material"
"f
acts, (Perera v.  Ekanaike), or where judgment has been obtained by force or"
"f
raud, (Gunaratne v.Dingiri  Banda, Jayasuriya  v.  Kotelawela).  (b)  Where  fresh"
"evidence has cropped up since judgment which was unknown earlier to the parties"
"relying on  it,  (Sinnethamby-supra), and fresh evidence which no reasonable"
"d
i
l
i
gence could have helped to disclose earlier, (Mapalathan-supra). (c) Where"
"j
udgments have been pronounced by mistake  and  decrees  entered  thereon,"
"(
S
i
nnethamby-supra), provided of course that it is an error which connotes a"
"reasonable or excusable  error,  (Perera  v.  Don  Simon).  The  remedy  could"
"therefore  be  availed  of where  an  Attorney-at-Law  has  by  mistake consented"
"to judgment contrary to express instructions of his client, for in such cases it could"
"be said that there was in reality no consent, (Phipps-Supra, Narayan  Chetty  v."
"Azeez),  but  not where the Attorney-at-Law  has  been  given  a  general  authority"
