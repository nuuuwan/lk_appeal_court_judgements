"In  M.A.  Don  Lewis  v.  D.W.S.Dissanayake      70  NLR  8    His  Lordship"
"Tennekoon,J (as he then was) held;"
"“These being the facts the first question that arises for consideration is"
"whether this court should exercise its extraordinary powers of revision or by way"
"o
f
 
Restitutio in Integrum in favour of the applicant. There is no doubt in my mind"
"that the petitioner was aware of the partition action from the date the Surveyor"
"f
i
rst went on the land. Petitioner has only himself to blame if he pursued the ill-"
"advised course of trying to usurp the place of the 8th defendant-respondent."
"Petitioner could, long before the Interlocutory Decree, have sought to have himself"
"added instead of taking the inexplicable course he did. Even after the Interlocutory"
"Decree was entered the petitioner in seeking to intervene persisted in trying to"
"persuade the District Court that he and Carolis Caldera were one and the same"
"person. Further when his application to intervene was dismissed by the District"
"Court (which in its order explicitly stated that the petitioner’s remedy if any was"
"by way of an application for revision to this court) the petitioner did nothing for 8"
"months. It is not the function of this court in the exercise of the   jurisdiction now"
"being invoked to relieve parties of the consequences of their own folly, negligence"
"and laches. The maxim Vigilantibus, non dormientibus, jura subveniunt provides"
"a
 sufficient answer to the petitioner’s application on the ground now under"
"consideration.”"
