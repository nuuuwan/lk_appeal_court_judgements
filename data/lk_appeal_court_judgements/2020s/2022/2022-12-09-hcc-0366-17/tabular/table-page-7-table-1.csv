"In this case, the injuries sustained by the deceased play a  decisive role in"
"determination  of  this  case  as  to  whether  the  Appellant  had  actuated  the"
"murderous intention or not. Hence, the circumstantial evidence pertaining"
"to injuries found on the deceased’s body need to be discussed in detail."
"PW10,  Consultant  JMO  who  examined  the  body  clearly  stated  that  there"
"were large number of injuries on the deceased’s body which were calculated"
"to be 110. He had opined that there could be even more injuries which had"
"been inflicted overlapping on existing injuries. These injuries were primarily"
"blunt force injuries. The patterns and the injuries are consistent with those"
"inflicted  by  poles,  sticks,  fist  blows,  forceful  grips,  nail  marks  and  being"
"dashed hard on flat surfaces and a ridge and vigorous shaking of the head."
"The injuries are in different ages; from few days to few hours."
"According  to  the  JMO,  the  death  was  caused  due  to  multiple  blunt  force"
"injuries over few days and intensified on the date of death causing internal"
"bleeding, leading to Hypovolaemia, acute left ventricle failure and acute sub"
"dura haemorrhage. Lack of food was also noted in the Gastro Intestinal Tract."
"The  Pattern  of  blunt  force  injuries  is  in  keeping  with  blows  inflicted  with"
"blunt  weapons,  dashing  the  deceased  against  hard  surfaces  and  a  ridge,"
"forceful grips, nail marks and vigorous shaking of the head."
"The  JMO  further  stated  that  the  findings  are  consistent  with  that  the"
"deceased  had  been  subjected  to  cruelty  and  extreme  violence  including"
"(probably, not limited to) deprivation of food, and physical abuse. There is"
"medical evidence of exposure to unnatural acts of sex over period of time in"
"the past. (Deceased’s rectum is dilated)"
"PW10, in his evidence at page 82 of the brief stated although some injures"
"are not directly cause the death but other injuries inflicted on the deceased’s"
"body, especially on her head and internal injuries caused to her body which"
"led  to  Hypovolaemia  condition  had  directly  contributed  to  her  death.  The"
"relevant portion of the evidence of PW10 is re-produced below:"
