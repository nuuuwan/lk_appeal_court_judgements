"In Gamini v. The Attorney General [1999] 1 SLR 321 the court held that:",""
"","“The use of the criterion of external physical factors and internal"
"","physical factors to distinguish between plea of automatism and"
"","insanity is wholly incongruous in the law of Sri Lanka. Our law is"
"","that  in  a  plea  of  automatism  the  accused  must  lay  a  sufficient"
"","foundation for his plea by leading evidence that his mind was not"
"","controlling  his  limits  at  all  at  the  time  of  the  commission  of  the"
"","offence. It is not sufficient for the accused to lay the foundation"
"","and discharge his evidential burden by establishing that his mind"
"","was  acting  imperfectly  at  that  time,  if  he  was  still  reacting  to"
"","stimuli and controlling his limbs in a purposive way. In such an"
"","event he would fail to lay a sufficient foundation for the plea of"
"automatism.  He  must  establish","that  his  acts  were  wholly"
"conclusive and not purposive in any manner”.",""
