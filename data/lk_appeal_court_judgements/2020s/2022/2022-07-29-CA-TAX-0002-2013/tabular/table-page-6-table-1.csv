"to as the “TAC”) erred in holding that in terms of the Agreement with Sri Lankan"
"Airlines,  the  Appellant  has  to  serve  only  ‘transit  passengers”  arriving  in  Sri"
"Lanka on its Layyover Program and NOT tourists who are also passengers of"
"the Airline. Mr. Egalahewa then contended that the TAC erred in holding that"
"the  Appellant  is  not  a  “travel  agent”  since,  the  Appellant  is  engaged  in  the"
"business  with  SriLankan  Airlines  Ltd  by  providing  services  to  Sri  Lankan"
"Airlines in the capacity of a “handling agent”."
"[13] Mr. Egalahewa further contended that the TAC erred in holding that the"
"Appellant did not have a contract with the tourists for the purpose of carrying"
"on 
independent  business  activity  as  a 
travel  agent  and 
therefore, 
the"
"its 
Appellant’s  business  was  only  with  Sri  Lankan  Airlines  by  executing"
"directions under the Agreement as its handling agent and not as a travel agent."
"[14]  On  the  other  hand,  Mr.  Wigneswaran  while  conceding  that  the  parties"
"cannot claim a benefit by labelling themselves something that they are not, the"
"Appellant cannot lightly ignore the fact that the label employed by the parties"
"in the  Agreement  is not applicable, and that the Appellant in the present case"
"is estopped from claiming that he is  not a handling agent but a travel agent"
"for the following reasons:"
"1. 
the Appellant’s business relationship under the Agreement is only with Sri"
"Lankan  Airlines  Ltd  as  a  handling  agent 
for  the  Airlines,  even 
if 
the"
"Appellant provided services to passengers or tourists,  and therefore, the"
"Appellant was not carrying on an independent business as a travel agent"
"or  transporting  tourists  as  an  independent  entity  within  the  meaning  of"
"section 45 (2) (d) of the IRA 2006;"
"2.  There is a clear distinction between a travel agent and a handling agent"
"and 
the  Appellant  being  a  handling  agent  performs  certain 
functions"
"outsourced by the Sri Lankan Airlines but that did not make the Appellant"
"a travel agent as the Appellant failed to demonstrate that   he is  a travel"
"agent;"
"3.  The Appellant had no contractual relationship with passengers or tourists,"
"which forms the basis of the business under section 45 (2) (d) and received"
"payment  only  from  the  Sri  Lanka  Airlines,  and  the  Sri  Lanka  Airlines"
"reimbursed 
the 
Appellant’s 
cost 
of 
transfers, 
tours 
and 
hotel"
"accommodation  strictly  in  conformity  with  the  relevant  Sri  Lankan Airline"
"Layover  Voucher 
or  written 
authorisation 
of  Sri 
Lankan  Airlines."
"Accordingly, the Appellant does not fall within the  meaning of section 45"
"(2) (d) of the IRA 2006;"
"4.  The  Appellant  belatedly  claimed 
that  he  was 
involved 
in  a  different"
"business and a different source of income from providing transport services"
"for the first time before the TAC but the Appellant has failed to maintain and"
"prepare a statement of accounts in a manner that the profits and income"
