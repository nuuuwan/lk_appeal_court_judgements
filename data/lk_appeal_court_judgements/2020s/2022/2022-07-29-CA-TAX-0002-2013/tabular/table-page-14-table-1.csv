"passenger who stays in Sri Lanka for a period up to 14 days as per Annex1"
"of the Agreement."
"[34] For those reasons, I hold that it is not possible to give the word “includes”"
"in  the definition  clause  of  the  “SriLankan Layover Programme” a  restrictive"
"meaning  in  the  context  in  which  it  is  used  in  the  Agreement  and  limit  the"
"business  activity  of  the  Appellant  to  transit  passengers  of  the  SriLankan"
"Airlines. The TAC clearly erred in not considering the fact that the passengers"
"who  arrived  in  Sri  Lanka  on  the  SriLankan  Layover  Programme,  may  also"
"leave  the  airport for accommodation  in  Hotels  and  undertake  tours  up  to a"
"period of 1-14 days as per Annex 1, and such passengers are in fact tourists."
"The TAC completely disregarded the fact that those optional 1-14 day tours"
"selected  by  the  foreign  passengers  who  arrive  in  Sri  Lanka  fall  within  the"
"purview of the “Sri Lankan Layover Programme” set out in the Agreement. In"
"my  view  the  TAC  wrongly  held  that  the  Agreement  applied  only  to  transit"
"passengers who remained at the Airport for the next flight."
"Is the Appellant a “Travel Agent” under the agreement?"
"[35] The next question is to decide whether or not the Appellant acted as a"
"travel  agent  or  a  handling  agent  in  terms  of  the  Agreement  entered  into"
"between the Appellant and the SriLankan Airlines Ltd. As the parties sought"
"to  interpret  the  term  “handling  agent”    used  in  the  Agreement  in  different"
"manner,   the Court must first find out the true meaning and the substance of"
"the  transaction  and  the  way  in  which  the  Appellant  carried  on  business  in"
"terms of the Agreement."
"[36]  When  determining  the    true  nature  and  substance  of  the  relationship"
"between 
the  parties  and 
the  characterisation  of 
the 
relationship, 
it 
is"
"necessary to consider the proper approach to be adopted in interpreting the"
"true meaning of  the  Agreement.   It  is relevant  to note   that  certain  rules of"
"interpretation  have  been 
formulated  with  a  view 
to  guide 
the  Court 
in"
"interpreting  the  true  meaning  and  the  substance  of  the  Agreement  in  any"
"commercial Agreement such as the one we are concerned."
"General Rule- Textualism"
"[37]  The  general  rule  in  interpreting  any  written  agreement  or  a  text  is  to"
"understand and give full weight to the language used in its grammatical and"
"ordinary sense, so as to give the written agreement or a text a commercial"
"certainty  and  sensible  meaning  to  the  language  used  in  its  ordinary  and"
"grammatical sense. This ordinarily means that the words must prima facie be"
"taken to have been used in their ordinary and grammatical sense. The general"
"rule 
in 
  construing  wills,  statutes  and  written 
instruments 
is 
that 
the"
"grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless the"
"words would lead to some absurdity, or some repugnance or inconsistency"
