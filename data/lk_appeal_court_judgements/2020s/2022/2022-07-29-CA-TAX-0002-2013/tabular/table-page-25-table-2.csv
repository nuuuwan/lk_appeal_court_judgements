"9.  The  Appellant  must  handle  the  Airline’s  Layover  Programme  on  an"
"exclusive basis for the Airline and shall not service nor handle any similar"
"Programme for any other Airline operating into Sri Lanka."
"[63] The Appellant’s sole business with the Airline is to act as its travel agent"
"in relation to all obligations set out in the Agreement because the Airline is"
"not capable of handling those obligations, and thus, the Airline engaged the"
"Appellant  to  provide  those  services.  Clause  9  provides  that  the  Appellant"
"shall  invoice  the  Airline  for  all  Sri  Lankan  Layover  Programme  Vouchers"
"serviced by the Appellant and for other services provided to passengers upon"
"the Airline’s written authorisation during the previous month at the rates set"
"out 
in  Annex  1.  Accordingly, 
the  Appellant  provided  services 
to 
the"
"passengers of the Airline on Layover Programme on behalf of the Airline and"
"received  payment  from  the  SriLankan  Airline  as  the  agent  of  the  Airline"
"performing  almost  all  major  functions  of  a  travel  agent    referred  to  in  the"
"Agreement. This is the same position where the services are provided to any"
"other Airline or tourists through a foreign travel agent ."
"[64]  In  terms  of  the  Agreement,  the  Appellant  is  handling  the  MARS  and"
"RoomsNet softwares installed by the Airline for providing services to both the"
"passengers  and  the  Airline  through  the  MARS  and  RoomsNet  and  the"
"Appellant  received  a  payment/commission 
from 
the  Airline  at 
the  rate"
"specified in Annex 1. As described, a mere tour operator or a handling agent"
"will  buy  services  from  their  suppliers  such  as  hotels,  restaurants,  cafes,"
"saloons  and  airlines  and  sells  its  own  single  tour  packages  directly  to"
"passengers  etc."
"[65] The Appellant in the present case does not buy packages from the Sri"
"Lankan Airlines or offer independent tour packages to tourists. The Appellant"
"acts on the behalf of the Sri Lankan Airlines as its travel agent and receive a"
"payment/commission as per the rates specified in Annex 1 and as per the"
"accepted  standard  determined  by 
the  Airline.  On
