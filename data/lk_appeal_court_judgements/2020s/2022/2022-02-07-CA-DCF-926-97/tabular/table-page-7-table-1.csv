"by the Plaintiff, the burden shifts to the Defendant to prove on what"
"r
i
ght he is in possession of the property.”"
"In this case, the Added Defendant claims that the subject matter is a State"
"land. Hence, the burden is on the Added Defendant to establish the same"
"with strong and cogent evidence."
"U.A. Somapala, Subject clerk of Ambalangoda Divisional Secretariat and V."
"Kamalasena,  Assistant  Surveyor  General  gave  evidence  to  buttress  the"
"contention of the Added Defendant. On behalf of the Added Defendant, the"
"Surveyor  General  has  submitted  a  plan  marked  2V46  which  has  been"
"superimposed on the plans marked X and Y. It is to be noted that the plan"
"2V46 is not made in accordance with any title plan, and the same has not"
"been superimposed on any title plan of the Surveyor General as well."
"Having considered the totality of the evidence of U.A. Somapala, it is clear"
"that, he has no personal knowledge as to the fact that this is a State land."
"He  admitted  the  fact  that  there  are  no  documents  before  05.07.1981"
"pertaining 
to 
the 
land 
in  dispute,  at 
the  Divisional  Secretariat  of"
"Ambalangoda (vide page 244 of the Appeal brief)."
"Furthermore, the title plan relied by the Added Defendant is produced as"
"2V47. It is pertinent to be noted that 2V47 has not been superimposed on"
"the Surveyor General’s plan marked 2V46. It has been rightly observed by"
"the  learned  trial  Judge  that  the  land  in  dispute,  namely  ASSALAGALA"
"UDUMULLA is not shown in plan 2V47. V. Kamalasena, Assistant Surveyor"
"General, in cross-examination categorically stated that the land in suit is"
"not shown in plan 2V47 (vide Appeal brief Vol-I, page 286). It has been"
"transpired from the evidence of said V. Kamalasena that lot FSPP35/242 is"
"the land in dispute which has been shown as a northern boundary of the"
"State land which is depicted in plan 2V47. In this respect, it is abundantly"
"clear that the subject matter in this case is not a State land."
