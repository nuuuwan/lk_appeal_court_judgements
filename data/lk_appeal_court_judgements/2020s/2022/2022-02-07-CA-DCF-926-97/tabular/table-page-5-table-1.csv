"his  right  to  Odiris  Appuhamy  by  deed  No.  29220  dated  09.05.1923"
"(marked P3). The said Odiris Appuhamy by deed bearing No. 9128 dated"
"29.01.1950 (marked P4) transferred his right to Karalin Gurusinghe who"
"conveyed that right to Lokugamage Henry by deed bearing No. 1243 dated"
"21.07.1961 (marked P5). The said Locugamage Henry transferred his right"
"to the Plaintiff by deed No. 36196 dated 31.08.1978 (marked P6)."
"Mr. D.G. Mendis, Licensed Surveyor has superimposed his plan marked X"
"upon the title plan marked Y, and accordingly, the subject matter has been"
"identified as lots  A1 and A2  in the superimposed plan. According  to the"
"evidence given by the Surveyor, the Plaintiff is in possession of A1 and the"
"Defendant is in unauthorised possession of A2. At the trial, the Counsel for"
"the Added Defendant has opted not to cross examine this witness."
"Besides, Karalin Gurusingha, predecessor in title of the Plaintiff had filed"
"an  action  in  the  District  Court  of  Balapitiya  in  1959  (Case  No.  L-834)"
"against the Defendant in the instant case. Later, on 17.10.1960, this action"
"was  settled.  Accordingly,  the  said  Karalin  Gurusingha  had  given  four"
"perches from the land in dispute to the Defendant. It is to be noted that, in"
"that case the Defendant had not taken up the position that, this is a State"
"land (vide document marked P7)."
"The evidence adduced by the Plaintiff stating that he has been in possession"
"of the subject matter by cultivating Rubber plantation is substantiated with"
"the documents issued by the Office of the Rubber Controller (marked P10"
"and P11). The said documents have been proved by the oral evidence of"
"Justin Hettiarachchi, Officer of the Rubber Control Board."
"Moreover,  G.V.  Sirisena,  Grama  Niladhari  of  the  area,  in  his  evidence"
"categorically stated that this is not a State land, whereas the Counsel for the"
"Added Defendant has opted not to cross-examine this witness as well."
"Hence, in terms of the oral evidence adduced and the title deeds marked as"
"P3-P6, the title of the Plaintiff towards the subject matter is well established."
