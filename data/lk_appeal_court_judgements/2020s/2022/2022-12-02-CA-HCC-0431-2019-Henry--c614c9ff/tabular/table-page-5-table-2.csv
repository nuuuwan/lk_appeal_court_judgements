"deprived  of  a  fair  trial.  This  aspect  was  sufficiently"
"discussed in case of R. v. Dossi, 13 Cr.App.R.158."
"""In  Dossi  (supra),  it  was  held  that  a  date"
"specified 
in  an 
indictment 
is  not  a  material"
"matter  unless 
it 
is  an  essential  part  of 
the"
"alleged  offence;  the  defendant  may be  convicted"
"although 
the 
jury 
finds 
that 
the  offence  was"
"committed on  a date  other  than  that  specified  in"
"the  indictment.  Amendment  of  the  indictment  is"
"unnecessary,  although it  will be good practice to"
"do so (provided that there is no prejudice, below)"
"where 
it 
is  clear  on 
the  evidence 
that 
if 
the"
"offence was committed at all it was committed on"
"the day other than that specified."
"In 
case 
of  Wright 
V. 
Nicholson 
54"
"Cr.App.R.38, 
it  was  held 
that 
the  prosecution"
"should 
not 
be 
allowed 
to 
depart 
from 
an"
"allegation  that  an  offence  was  committed  on  a"
"particular  day 
in 
reliance  on 
the  principle 
in"
"Dossi  if  there  is  a  risk  that  the  defendant  has"
"been  misled  as 
to 
the  allegation  he  has 
to"
"answer or that he would be prejudiced in having"
"to  answer  a  less  specific  allegation,  as  to  the"
"importance of the provision of such particulars in"
