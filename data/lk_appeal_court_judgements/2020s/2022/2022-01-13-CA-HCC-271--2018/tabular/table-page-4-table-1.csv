"of  repeated  abuse  by the  appellant.  This  contradicts  the  position  taken by  the  appellant  and"
"corroborates the prosecution version."
"W
ith regard to the subsequent conduct of the appellant, it was the evidence of retired IP Bandara"
"(PW 04), that the appellant was absconding and evading arrest when he went to investigate the"
"incident. After the case for the prosecution was closed, the learned Trial Judge called for defence"
"and  the  appellant  while  testifying  took  up  contradictory  positions  and  the  prosecuting  state"
"counsel had marked several vital contradictions and omissions during the cross-examination of"
"the accused-appellant."
"P
W  02  further  stated  that  one  Indunil  too  had  sexual  intercourse  with  her  during  the  period"
"covered in the indictment. It was suggested to PW 02 that she falsely implicated the accused-"
"appellant at the behest of her siblings."
"T
he fact that the victim had sex with the accused-appellant, should be considered in light of the"
"allegations in the present case only. It is my view that the fact that the said victim had sex with"
"a person other than the accused-appellant is not prejudicial to the facts of the present case. This"
"is mainly because, at the time of the crime the victim was a 12-year-old girl, and the accused-"
"appellant had appealed against the conviction of the offence which violated section 364 (2) (e)"
"of  the  Penal  Code  (Amendment)  Act  No.  22  of  1995.  The  appellant  has  violated  a  statutory"
"offence and therefore, even though a third party had committed the same offence during the"
"same period on the same girl, it is not an excuse for the accused-appellant to put the blame on"
"the third party and escape from the rape charge, against the said underage girl. The law does"
"not allow the accused-appellant to be acquitted even if she had sex with another man during the"
"same period."
"T
he learned counsel for the accused-appellant also referred to the fact that the 1st complaint"
"was lodged with a reasonable delay and therefore the allegations were false. The victim had not"
"informed about this incident to her mother because the accused-appellant had asked her not to"
"do so."
"I
t was held in Bandara vs. The State 2001 (2) SLR 63 that if there is a valid reason or explanation"
"for the delay and if the trial Judge is satisfied with the reasons and explanations given, no trial"
"Judge would apply the test of spontaneity and contemporaneity and reject the testimony of a"
"witness  in  such  circumstances.  It  was  further  decided  “delayed  witnesses’  evidence  could  be"
"acted upon if there were reasons to explain the delay.”"
"I
t was argued by the learned counsel for the accused-appellant that two omissions were raised"
"about  PW  02's  testimony,  the  learned  trial  Judge  had  not  properly  considered  the  impact  of"
"these.  Omission  No.1  was  PW  02  stated  that  on  the  second  occasion  she  was  raped  by  the"
"accused-appellant  at  his  house.  The  statement  she  had  given  to  the  police  did  not  contain"
"anything about this. PW 02 stated in the cross-examination that she informed the police of this"
"incident. This was raised as an omission. The learned trial Judge in her judgment had considered"
"this omission thus:"
