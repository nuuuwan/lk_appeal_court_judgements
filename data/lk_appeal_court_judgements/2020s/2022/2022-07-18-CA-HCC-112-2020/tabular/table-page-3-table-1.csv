"affect his employment. It has been specifically pleaded that he may be ordered"
"to  pay  state  costs  instead  of  a  fine.  It  appears  from  the  proceedings  that  the"
"learned State Counsel who prosecuted the matter has not insisted on imposing"
"a jail term on the appellant as well as the first accused. Having considered the"
"fact  that  the  injured,  who  is  the  PW-01  named  in  the  indictment,  has  also"
"expressed his willingness to accept compensation and to conclude the matter, it"
"has  been  urged  the  Court  to  consider  these  factors  and  impose  a  suitable"
"sentence."
"In his sentencing order, learned High Court Judge has considered the fact that"
"the appellant and the first accused tendered an unconditional plea and also the"
"fact  that  the  injured,  namely,  PW-01  named  in  the  indictment,  has  expressed"
"his wish to obtain compensation, as mitigatory factors."
"Accordingly, the appellant and the other accused have been sentenced to 2 years"
"imprisonment  which  has  been  suspended  for  a  period  of  5  years.  In  addition,"
"they  have  been  ordered  to  pay  a  sum  of  Rs.  75000/-  each  to  PW-01  as"
"compensation. In addition to the above, the appellant and the 1st accused have"
"been  ordered  to  pay  Rs.  5000/-  each  as  fines.  In  default,  they  have  been"
"sentenced to one month imprisonment."
"It appears from the sentencing order that the submission made on behalf of the"
"appellant to the effect that he is a serving Army soldier and to consider imposing"
"a punishment which would not affect his employment has drawn the attention"
"of the learned High Court Judge. However, he has not been ordered to pay state"
"costs  instead  of  a  fine,  but  a  note  of  his  application  has  been  made  in  the"
"sentencing order."
"In the appeal under consideration, the appellant is only challenging the sentence"
"where  he  was  ordered  to  pay  a  fine  of  Rs.  5000/-,  and  seeking  this  Court's"
"indulgence to set aside the fine imposed and to consider imposing a state cost in"
"place of the fine."
