"In  Doole  v.  The  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  [1978-1979]  2  SLR  33  the  court"
"held that:"
"“as a rule an amendment to an indictment should be allowed if"
"it  would  have  the  effect  of  convicting  the  guilty  or  securing  the"
"acquittal of the innocent, but it should not be allowed if it would"
"cause substantial injustice or prejudice to the accused.”"
"In this case, after the conclusion of the prosecution case and after calling"
"the  defence, 
the  prosecution  had  made  an  application 
to  amend 
the"
"existing  charge  under  Section  167  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act"
"No.  15  of  1979.  But 
the  prosecution  had  presented 
the  amended"
"indictment with an alternative count under Section 365 (b) (2) of the Penal"
"Code  as  amended.  The  reason 
for  the  amendment  was  that  evidence"
"presented during the trial was not fitted to bring a conviction under Section"
"364(1) of Penal Code as amended. Hence, the question arises as to whether"
"the  charge  brought  under  Section  365(b) 
(2)  to  the 
indictment  as  an"
"alternative count is proper in this case."
"In this case, at the time of closing the case for the prosecution,  they were"
"unable to prove the charge of rape against the Appellant. As the prosecutrix"
"had already doubted about her evidence, the prosecution is not entitled to"
"bring  an  alternative  charge  to  the  indictment  under  Section  365(b)  (2)  (b)."
"In  a  charge  of  rape,  the  prosecution  must  prove  penetration.  In  grave"
"sexual  abuse  prosecution  is  not  required  to  prove  penetration.  Thus,  the"
"ingredients in a charge of rape are different from the ingredients that must"
"be  proved  in  a  charge  of  grave  sexual  abuse.  Hence,  the  best  course  of"
"action  should  have  been 
the  amendment  of 
the  existing  charge  as"
"requested under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act."
