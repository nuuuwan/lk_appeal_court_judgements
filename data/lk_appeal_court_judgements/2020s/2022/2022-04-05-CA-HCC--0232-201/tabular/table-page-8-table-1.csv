"Lecamwasam,J. held that:"
"“On  a  plain  reading  of  the  above  section  it  is  clear,  that  the  section"
"envisaged  a  grave  situation  which  falls  short  of  rape.  It  cannot  be  a"
"mere ‘Touch’. It has to be much more serious than a touch and to come"
"within  the  ambit  of  ‘Grave  Sexual  Abuse’  it  must  be  of  a  very  high"
"degree,  so  serious  and  grave  in  nature  that  it  can  only  fall  short  of"
"Rape,  but  must  surpass  situations  expected  in  section  345,365  and"
"365A”."
