"3.  PW4 â€“ Inspector of Police Ruparatne, Police Station Panadura South"
"Petitioners pleaded not guilty, and the case proceeded to trial where the victim (PW1)"
"was  the  sole  lay  witness  produced  by  the  prosecution.  The  petitioners  gave  evidence"
"under  oath  from  the  witness  box  when  the  defence  was  called,  and  an  independent"
"witness was also called."
"At the conclusion of the trial, the learned Magistrate convicted the petitioners for the"
"second  charge  of  causing  grievous  hurt  and  acquitted  them  on  the  first  charge  of"
"robbery. The learned Magistrate imposed a term of 03 months rigorous imprisonment."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  conviction  and  the  sentence  dated  23.07.2018  and"
"12.11.2018, respectively, the petitioners   filed an appeal to the High Court Panadura,"
"which was disallowed on 14.01.2020. Dissatisfied with the said order, the petitioners"
"have preferred the present application invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court."
"Impugned High Court Order"
"In impugning the High Court order, the Counsel for the petitioners presented two main"
"arguments  which  were  contended  as  amounting  to  a  gross  misdirection  of  the  law"
"causing a miscarriage of justice and grave prejudice to the petitioners."
