"The  High  Court  Judge  has  observed  the  fact  that  the  petitioner  going  to  the"
"house of the victim on the date of offence is admitted, the only questionable"
"thing  is  the  alleged  offence.  But  upon  considering  the  evidence  of  the  victim"
"the  High  Court  judge  has  observed,  although  there  is  a  delay  in  lodging  the"
"complaint 
the  version  of 
the  victim 
remains  consistent 
throughout 
the"
"evidence  except  for  a  few  contradictions  and  omissions  which  the  court  has"
"decided to be not very important."
"This Court too observes that the victim had been consistent in his narration of"
"facts, the only shortcoming in the prosecution’s story is the delay in the story"
"being  told  by  the  victim  to  the  mother,  which  in  the  opinion  of  this  Court"
"would have been due to the immaturity of the victim who has not understood"
"the gravity of the incident. The prosecution evidence, or rather the evidence of"
"the victim, has been corroborated by the other witnesses of the prosecution."
"The position taken up by the defense or rather the petitioner in the High Court"
"has  been  that  the  incident  was  fabricated  by  the  victim’s  mother  due  to  a"
"monetary  transaction.  This  fact,  the  prosecution  witnesses  have  denied  and"
"more over it is very hard to believe that parents would put through their own"
"child  through  a  situation  of  this  nature  for  mere  Rs.  2000  as  alleged  by  the"
"petitioner.  Therefore, 
the  decision  of 
the 
learned  High  Court 
Judge 
to"
"disregard the defense is justifiable."
"Hence, it is the considered view of this Court that the learned High Court Judge"
"is  justified  in  finding  the  accused  petitioner  guilty  for  both  offences  and  the"
"sentences imposed is reasonable in view of the evidence adduced at the trial."
"Therefore,  this  Court  sees  no  exceptional  illegalities  in  the  judgment  of  the"
"Learned  High  Court  Judge  which  shocks  the  conscious  of  this  Court.  As  such,"
"the instant application for revision is dismissed."
