"The main contention  of the Counsel for the suspect is that the instant act had"
"been  used  against  the  suspect  in  order  to  deny  him  bail  when  the  offence  in"
"question do not fall within the provisions of the act."
"The  Counsel  for  the  respondents  objected  to  the  application  and  said  that  the"
"complainant in the instant matter is related to a complainant where the suspect"
"friend is an accused."
"But we are unable to see as to how that situation falls under the provisions of the"
"instant act."
"But we note that the suspect has been in remand for over a period of one year"
"and we see that the complaint against the suspect is very vague with regard to"
"the definitions under this act hence we see this as an act which had abused the"
"provisions of the instant act which in turn violates the objectives of the statute."
"As such the instant application for bail is allowed and this Court directs the learned"
"Magistrate  to  enlarge  the  above-named  suspect  on  suitable  conditions  of  bail"
"upon the receipt of this order."
"As such the instant application is allowed."
