"In R vs. Broadcasting Complaints Commission ex parte Owen (1985) 2 All ER 522 (at"
"p.523), the Court has held that;"
"“When the reason given by a statutory body for taking or not taking a particular course of"
"action were not mixed and could be clearly disentangled and where the court was satisfied"
"that even though one reason might be bad in law the statutory body would nevertheless have"
"reached  precisely  the  same  decision  for  the  remaining,  valid  reasons,  the  court  would  not"
"interfere by way of judicial review.”"
