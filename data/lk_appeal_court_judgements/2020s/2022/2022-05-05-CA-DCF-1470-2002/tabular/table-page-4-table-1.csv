"had not established any flow in his service as a government officer. Therefore, the trial Judge"
"had not discussed the issue."
"H
owever, the Appellants  have not  established how that issue will support their appeal. The"
"preliminary  survey  was  admitted  at  the  trial  by  the  Appellant.    Their  contention  was  even"
"though lots No.1-3 was Balla Mala Pitiya. Lot 4 was Kolain Kumbura.  However, they failed"
"to call for a second survey."
"T
hey have not exercised their right to have a second survey to prove that the land is different."
"They have failed to  establish their claim  by superimposing the preliminary Plan on another"

"The evidence proved that specific constructions were done by the 4th and 5th Defendants. As"
