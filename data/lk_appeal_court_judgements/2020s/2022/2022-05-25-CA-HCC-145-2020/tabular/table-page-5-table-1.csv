"Explanation-A  criminal  trial  or  inquiry  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  proceeding"
"between the prosecutor and the accused within the meaning of this section.”"
"In  the  case  of  Francis  Samarawickrema  vs    Dona  Enatto  Hilda  Jayasinghe"
"Supreme  Court    appeal  7/2004  decided  on  7th  May  2009,    Justice  Masoof"
"stated as follows:"
"“In this connection, it is relevant to note that E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy, The"
"Law of Evidence, Vol. I, at pages 492-493, states as follows:"
"“The court has to exercise the power given in Section 33 with great caution and"
"must  insist  on  strict  proof  before  holding  that  the  witness  is  dead  or  cannot  be"
"found  or  has  become  incapable  of  giving  evidence  or  has  been  kept  out  of  the"
"way  by 
the  adverse  party  or  his  presence  cannot  be  secured  without  an"
"unreasonable  amount  of  delay  and  expense.  But  once  any  of  the  first  four"
"conditions of death, not being found, incapacity to give evidence or being kept out"
"of  the  way  by  the  adverse  party,  has  been  proved,  the  court  has  no  discretion"
"and  must  admit  the  deposition  since  Section  33  declares  such  deposition  to  be"
"relevant and, therefore, admissible.” (emphasis added)."
"Coomaraswamy  concedes  that  a  court  of  law  does  have  the  discretion  with"
"respect to the last condition in Section 33 relating to a witness whose presence in"
"court cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which “the court"
"considers unreasonable”. The present case does not arise from such a situation,"
"and  there  is  no  way  in  which  the  dead  witness  can  be  made  to  give  evidence."
"Accordingly, I am firmly of the opinion that Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance"
"is  applicable 
in  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  and  that  the  Court  had  no"
"discretion in the matter.”"
