"I am of the view that this rule should be applicable to any application before the"
"High Court requiring it to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction of revision or for"
"any such application before the Court of Appeal."
"I  also  find  that  as  determined  correctly  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  the"
"petitioner cannot claim to be a party who was adversely affected by the order of"
"the learned Magistrate of Dambulla, since he has specifically stated that he is"
"not claiming the vehicle which was the subject matter of the inquiry held."
"I  am  of  the  view  that  the  petitioner  had  no  locus  standi  to  file  the  revision"
"application before the High Court and therefore, has no basis to succeed in an"
"appeal against the decision of the learned High Court Judge."
"Accordingly, I agree with the learned DSGâ€™s submission that this appeal should"
"stand dismissed on the above considered grounds alone."
"In view of the above, considering the other grounds of appeal urged on behalf of"
"the petitioner needs no further consideration."
"The  appeal  therefore  is  dismissed.  The  judgement  of  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge of Kandy is affirmed."
"The Registrar is directed to send copies of this judgement to the High Court of"
"Kandy as well as the Magistrate Court of Dambulla for necessary information."
