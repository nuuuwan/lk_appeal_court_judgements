"Dayananda Dissanayake, Commission of Election and Another S.C. (FR) Application"
"No.67/2008 has recognised the duty of authorities to reason out their decision. In"
"the said case Shirani A. Bandaranayake j. (as she was then) held as follows;"
"“Accordingly, an analysis of the attitude of the Courts since the beginning of the 20th century"
"clearly  indicates  that  despite  the  fact  that  there  is  no  general  duty  to  give  reasons  for"
"administrative  decisions,  the  Courts  have  regarded  the  issue  in  question  as  a  matter"
"affecting  the  concept  of  procedural  fairness.  Reasons  for  an  administrative  decision  are"
"essential to correct any errors and thereby to ensure that a person, who had suffered due"
"to an unfair decision, is treated according to the standard of fairness. In such a situation"
"without a statement from the person, who gave the impugned decision or the order, the"
"decision process would be flawed and the decision would create doubts in the minds of the"
"aggrieved person as well of the others, who would try to assess the validity of the decision."
"Considering the present process in procedural fairness vis-à-vis, rights of the people, there"
"is  no  doubt  that  a  statement  of  reasons  for  an  administrative  decision  is  a  necessary"
"requirement.”"
"“on a consideration  of  our  case  law  in the  light of  the attitude  taken  by  Courts  in other"
"countries, it is quite clear that giving reasons to an administrative decision is an important"
"feature in today’s context, which cannot be lightly disregarded.”"
