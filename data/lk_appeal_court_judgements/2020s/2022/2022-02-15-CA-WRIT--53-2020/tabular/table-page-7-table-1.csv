"authority  has  reasoned  out  his/her  decision,  it  is  necessary  to  ascertain  whether"
"such reasons are fair and acceptable. In the case of Osmond V. Public Service Board"
"Of New South Wales And Another (1985) L.R.C.(Const)1041, Kirby, j. had stated that,"
"“The duty of public officials, in making discretionary decisions affecting others in the exercise of"
"statutory  powers,  is  to  act  justly  and  fairly;  this will  normally  impose  an obligation  to  state  the"
"reasons for their decisions. Such an obligation will exist where the absence of reasons would render"
"nugatory a facility provided to appeal against the decision or would diminish a facility to test the"
"decision by judicial review and ensure that it complies with the law and that relevant matters only"
"have been taken into account.”"
