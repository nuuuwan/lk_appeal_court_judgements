"The Petitioners in this application seek inter alia for a mandate in the nature of a writ of"
"Prohibition,  prohibiting  1st  to  3rd  Respondents  from  accepting  and/or  acting  upon  a"
"purported certificate submitted by a Chartered Architect other than the Petitioners for the"
"purpose  of  issuing  the  Certificate  of  Conformity  (‘CoC’)  in  respect  of  the  said  Project."
"However,  after  filing  this  application,  the  CoC  has  been  issued  by  the  1st  Respondent-"
"Urban Development Authority  (‘UDA’) and this Court temporarily suspended the said"
"CoC until Court looks in to the questions involved in this application."
"In  view  of  the  grounds  of  urgency  urged  by  all  learned  Counsel  appearing  for  several"
"parties in this case, the Court as far as possible gave priority to this matter despite of the"
"busy schedule of this Court. This Court at one occasion fixed this matter to be taken up"
"for support even during late evening (from 2.30pm to 6.00pm) in order to accommodate"
"the learned Counsel. As well illustrated in the Journal Entries, this matter has been fixed"
"for hearing on dates with short intervals."
"All learned Counsel for several parties concluded their submissions on 08.03.2022. The"

"learned Counsel for the Developer drew the attention of Court to the contents of a joint"
"motion dated 21.03.2022 filed on behalf of the Petitioners and the Developer. On perusal"
"of the said motion, it appears that the Petitioners and the Developer have entered in to a"
"written settlement agreement on 20.03.2022, a date which is only 12 days away from the"
"last day of submissions in this case. On 31.03.2022, the learned President’s Counsel for"
"the Petitioners moved to withdraw this application based on the fact that the payments"
"have been duly received in terms of the settlement agreement as elaborated in the motion"
"dated 24.03.2022. At this juncture, the learned Additional Solicitor General (‘ASG’) for"
"the 1st to 4th, 6th, 9th to 14th Respondents and the learned Counsel for the 5th Respondent"
"moved that costs be awarded in favour of the respective Respondents and indicated that"
"they had no objections in withdrawing the application subjected to costs. The learned ASG"
"raised the questions on costs apart from the preliminary objections raised by him on the"
"purported  defective  affidavit  of  the  Petitioners  and  also  on  the  question  of  not  having"
"necessary parties before Court."
