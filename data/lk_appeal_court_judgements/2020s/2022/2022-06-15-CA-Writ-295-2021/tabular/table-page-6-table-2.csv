"The duty covering Principal of the Royal College in his affidavit (which was submitted to"
"this Court) has affirmed that the Ministry of Education subsequently has authorized the"
"1:15000 scale map for the purposes of interviews.  In any event, the Respondents assert"
"that the Dudley Senanayake College is close to the place of residence of the Petitioner than"
"Royal College in view of the extracts of the Surveyor General’s map marked ‘R2’ and also"
"according to 1:15000 scale map."
"As  opposed  to  the  above  arguments  of  the  Respondents,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"Petitioners contends that in view of 7.1.5 of the Circular ‘P2’, it is necessary to consider"
"the straight distance and the 1:50000 scale map when considering the proximity from the"
"place of residence. Further, the Petitioners urge that the Board is not authorized to use"
"1:15000 scale map and no proper approval to use an enlarged map has been tendered to"
"Court. Therefore, the Petitioners’ contention is that using an enlarged 1:15000 scale map"
"at the interview is illegal, ultra vires and contrary to Circulars ‘P2’ and ‘P3’."
"The Petitioners further assert that in terms of the Clause 7.1.5 of Circular ‘P2’ as amended"
"by Circular ‘P3’, the Respondents must draw a circle with a radius from the main door of"
"the  Petitioner’s  house  and  the  main  office  of  the  school,  and  only  if  there  are  primary"
"schools where the child could be enrolled, within the said circle, marks shall be deducted"
"for the said other schools."
"When assaying the arguments raised by the learned State Counsel justifying the adoption"
"of 1:15000 scale map, it is important to examine carefully the provisions of Clause 7.1.5"
"of the Circular ‘P2’ (Clause 6.0(e) of ‘P5’). It is no doubt the prescribed map as per in the"
"said Clause 7.1.5 is the map on the scale 1:50000 prepared by the Department of Surveyor"
"General. A circle with a radius from the main door of the applicant’s house and the main"
"office  of  the  school  should  be  drawn  in  order  to  ascertain  the  number  of  Government"
"Schools  with  primary  sections  located  closer  to  the  place  of  residence  than  the  school"
