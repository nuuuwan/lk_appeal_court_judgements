"In light of the above, I am of the view that the scheme of the said Clause 7.1.5 is to assess"
"accurately the fact whether a school upon which marks have been deducted (under Clause"
"7.2.4) is actually located within the said circle drawn. Thus, the Board should take such"
"decision without limiting its discretion on a narrow interpretation of any wordings of any"
"sentence of the said Clause. It is a clear admission by the Petitioners that as per the Google"
"map, a part of the Dudley Senanayake College is within the respective circle and the other"
"portion is outside the said circle. Therefore, I take the view that in such a situation, it is"
"very  much  appropriate  for  the  Board  to  ascertain  the  exact  location  of  such  school  by"
"utilizing a lawful additional method."
"The learned State Counsel argues that the rationale for using the said enlarged scale map"
"is to identify the localized area better with more clarity as a 1:15000 scale map would offer"
"an enlarged picture compared to 1:50000 scale map. A scale map of 1:15000 is a larger"
"scale map which means that an inch only depicts 15,000 miles on the ground and that is"
"because the geographic extent shown on a relatively larger scale map is small."
"In light of the foregoing, I am inclined to accept the above proposition of the learned State"
"Counsel  subject  to  certain  limitations  focused  below.  It  is  no  doubt  that  the  Board  is"
"compelled to use the 1:50000 scale map for the purpose of considering proximity from the"
"place  of  residence.  I  accept  on  principle  the  proposition  of  the  learned  Counsel  of  the"
"Petitioners that it is imperative that admission of children to grade one of Government"
"Schools be necessarily decided upon strictly in terms of the Circular marked ‘P2’ (which"
"is  the  applicable  law),  and  not  determined  according  to  any  other  ground  whatsoever."
"However, as I have pointed out earlier, I am of the view that the provisions of the Clause"
"7.1.5 itself provides a deviation and has allowed the comparison of the Google map with"
"the Surveyor General’s map when a question arises. Accordingly, I observe that there was"
"an obligation for the Board to resolve the question as to how the proximity from the place"
"of  residence  could  be  assessed  in  an  event  the  Petitioners  claim  that  only  a  portion  of"
"Dudley Senanayake College is within the boundary line."
"Therefore,  I  hold  that  using  a  1:15000  scale  map  in  a  situation  where  a  portion  of  the"
"disputed school is located within the said circle and when the other portion is outside the"
"circle  cannot  be  considered  as  unlawful,  irrational  and  unreasonable,  provided  that  the"
"relevant authorities seek permission from the Ministry of Education in that regard or keep"
"the said Ministry informed about such action. I am of the view that I should exercise my"
"discretion to accept the version of the duty covering Principal of the Royal College which"
