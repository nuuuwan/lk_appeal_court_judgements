"deceased  was  found  fallen  just  before  he  saw  the  three-wheeler  leaving  the"
"hotel  compound,  it  can  be  assumed  that  it  was  someone  who  came  in  the"
"three-wheeler  who  caused 
the 
injuries 
to 
the  deceased.  However,  PW-02"
"Pradeep  has  not  identified  anybody  who  was  inside  the  three-wheeler  or  even"
"whether there were persons inside the vehicle or who was driving the vehicle at"
"that time."
"It  can  be  safely  assumed  that  it  may  be  the  appellant  who  was  driving  the"
"vehicle because of the evidence of PW-05 who was the owner of the vehicle and"
"that  of  PW-03  the  son  of  the  owner,  who  found  the  vehicle  left  abandoned"
"behind a boutique."
"I  find  that  in  this  context,  what  the  appellant  has  told  PW-03  the  son  of  the"
"owner when asked by him as to what happened should also be relevant. He has"
"told him that the vehicle got damaged as a result of an issue when he went on"
"a hire to the hotel. Other than that, he has not divulged any other detail as to"
"what  happened.  The  evidence  of  PW-03  also  confirms 
the 
fact 
that 
the"
"appellant wanted to take the vehicle for hire on that evening because he could"
"not earn enough money during the day."
"In my view, the above facts, taken cumulatively, are strongly suggestive of the"
"fact  that  the  appellant  may  have  gone  to  the  hotel  where  the  incident  took"
"place taking some passengers, as for his usual livelihood."
"Under  the  circumstances,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  available  circumstantial"
"evidence only points to the irresistible conclusion that it was the appellant who"
"has  committed  the  crime,  as  there  may  be  some  others  who  were  involved  in"
"the  brawl  which  caused  injuries  to  the  deceased.  I  find  that  the  learned  High"
"Court  Judge  was  factually  wrong  when  he  determined  that  the  only  inference"
"that can be reached is that it was the appellant who has caused the injuries to"
"the  deceased,  given  the  fact  that  there  were  seven  others  who  were  charged"
"before the Magistrate."
