"I
n  this  case  there  is  no  direct  evidence  as  to  who  committed  the  murder.  The"
"only evidence against the appellant is that the two rings which were recovered"
"from the pawning shop by the police, were said to be worn by the deceased."
"However, the fact that the covered rings were worn by the deceased and the two"
"rings were pawned by the appellant was not proved beyond reasonable doubt."
"The evidence is wholly insufficient to convict the appellant  to  the two charges"
"leveled against him. I set aside the conviction and acquit the appellant."
"The Appeal is allowed."
