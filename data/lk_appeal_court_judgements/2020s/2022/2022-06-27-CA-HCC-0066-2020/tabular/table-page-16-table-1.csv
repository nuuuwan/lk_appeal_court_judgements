"In the case of Lafeer Vs. Queen 74 NLR 246, H.N.G.Fernando, C.J. stated;"
"“There was thus both misdirection and non-direction on matters concerning"
"the standard of proof. Nevertheless, we are of opinion having regard to the"
"cogent and uncontradicted evidence that a jury properly directed could not"
"have  reasonably  returned  a  more  favourable  verdict.  We  therefore  affirm"
"the conviction and sentence and dismiss the appeal.”"
