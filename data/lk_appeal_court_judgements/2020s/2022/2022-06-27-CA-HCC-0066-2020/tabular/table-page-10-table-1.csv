"Bringing  to  the  notice  of  the  Court  that  the  prosecutrix  has  admitted  the"
"friendship  between  the  two  and  the  fact  that  she  received  various  gifts  and"
"favours  from  the  appellant,  it  was  the  contention  of  the  learned  President’s"
"Counsel that, these important facts that were in favour of the appellant has not"
"been considered by the learned High Court Judge in the judgment."
"He  was  also  critical  of  the  way  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  acted  in"
"relation to the PW-02 and the way his evidence has been rejected, which were"
"evidence  in  favour  of  the  appellant’s  defence  of  consent.  It  was  his  argument"
"that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  rejected  the  evidence  in  favour  of  the"
"appellant  on  unreasonable  grounds,  which  amounts  to  a  denial  of  a  fair  trial"
"for him."
"In the judgment the learned High Court Judge has shifted the burden of proof"
"to the appellant, which a trial judge cannot do, is another matter urged by the"
"learned President’s Counsel at the hearing of this appeal."
"It was the position  of the learned  Deputy Solicitor General  (DSG) on behalf of"
"the  respondent  that  this  is  a  clear  case  where  the  unwilling  prosecutrix  was"
"assaulted  and  made  to  submit  to  the  will  of  the  appellant.  Pointing  to  the"
"evidence  of  the  Judicial  Medical  Officer  (JMO),  it  was  her  contention  that  the"
"evidence of the JMO amply supports the version of events by the prosecutrix. It"
"was  her  position  that  the  evidence  of  the  prosecutrix  was  cogent  as  to  the"
"material  events,  although  she  may  have  faulted  in  her  evidence  in  relation  to"
"the way she was taken to the guest house in the three-wheeler. Admitting that"
"there are flaws in the judgement in the way the learned High Court Judge has"
"analyzed the evidence, it was the contention of the learned DSG that it has not"
"caused any material prejudice to the appellant. It was her position that even if"
"considered in the correct perspective, there is ample evidence to establish that"
"the  prosecution  has  proved  the  case  against  the  appellant  beyond  reasonable"
"doubt."
