"Judge failed to analyse the evidence of the appellant independently from the prosecution evidence"
"to see whether it creates a reasonable doubt against the case of the prosecution."
"It was decided in Ariyadasa Vs Queen 68 CLW 97 as follows;"
"a) if the jury believed the accused person’s evidence, he is entitled to be acquitted and"
"b) the accused is also entitled to be acquitted if, his evidence, though not believed was such"
"that it cause the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt regarding his guilt."
"In Martin vs Queen 69 CLW 21 the court held as follows;"
"""Even if the jury declined to believe the appellants' version, he was yet entitled to be"
"acquitted on the charge, if his version raised in the mind of the jury a reasonable doubt as to"
"the truth of the prosecutions' case.”"
