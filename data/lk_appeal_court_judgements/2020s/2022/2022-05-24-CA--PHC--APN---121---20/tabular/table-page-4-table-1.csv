"while 
the  petition  has  been 
filled  on  24/07/2006,  entailing 
an"
"unexplained  delay  of  four  months  and  eight  days/  in  the  absence  of"
"explanation to the contrary this delay be considered unreasonable”."
"In  a  case  decided  by  this  bench,  CA/PHC/APN/21/2021  this  court  has"
"decided that “delay is considered to be a fatal error if it’s not explained"
"to  the  satisfaction  of  Court,  and  it  has  been  held  by  this  bench  in  the"
"case  of  CA/PHC/APN/78/2021.  This  Court  notes  that  counsel  for  the"
"petitioner  could  not  explain  as  to  why  the  delay  in  filing  the  instant"
"application."
"The 
counsel 
for 
the 
respondents 
raised 
the  objection 
that 
the"
"substituted petitioner does not have the locus standi to file the instant"
"application."
"As  per  Merriam-Webster 
(since  1828)  Dictionary, 
locus 
standi 
is"
"defined  as  a  right  to  appear  in  a  court  or  before  anybody  on  a  given"
"question: a  right  to  be  heard.  Furthermore  Sathe,  Public  Participation"
"and  Judicial  Process  elaborated  the  definition  of  the  locus  standi  as,"
"“Locus Stand  rule is based on good policy. The principle is that court"
"time  as  well  as  energy  should  not  be  wasted  on  hypothetical  or"
"abstract  questions  or  on  a  professional  trial  or  a  busy  institution.”"
"Moreover,  United  Nations  and  the  Rule  of  Law:  Access  to  Justice"
"declares  that  “Access  to 
justice 
is  a  principle  of  the  rule  of 
law."
"Without access to justice, people will not be able to raise their voices"
"and exercise their rights. Therefore, fair, and equitable justice must be"
"ensured for all members without discrimination.”"
