"Chapter  40  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code.  Such  a  donation  cannot  be"
"ratified subsequently, when the minor comes of age.”"
"As  per  the  case  of  Sello  Hamy  v  Rapheal  1  SCR.  73,  it  was  generally"
"stated  that  a  conveyance  by  an  infant  was  not  void  but  voidable,  but"
"Clarence, J., points out that the defendant, who then attacked the deed,"
"had  no  locus  standi  to  do  so.  Because  he  in no  sense  represented the"
"minor, and he expressly abstains from finding whether the grantor was"
"or was not a  minor, because such a finding would have no bearing on"
"the  decision  of  the  case.  Besides,  that  was  the  case  of  a  sale  which"
"might  or  might  not  be  beneficial  to  the  minor  making  it.  A  donation"
"certainly cannot possibly be beneficial to the donor. There is no doubt"
"on the authorities that the first plaintiff could have obtained restitutio"
"in integrum if she had applied in time, but that remedy is now barred."
"In the case of Helena Hamline et al v Nonahamy et al 60 DC Colombo ,"
"33,943, 
under 
the 
Roman-Dutch 
law 
a  married  woman 
has"
"no locus standi in 
judicio, but  where, 
rightly  or  wrongly,  a  wife 
is"
"brought in, as a separate party, to a case along with the husband, and"
"judgment 
is  entered 
in 
favor  of  both,  she  has  all 
the  rights  and"
"privileges  of  a 
joint 
judgment-creditor,  and 
it 
is  not  open 
to 
the"
"husband  to  enter 
into  a  compromise  with  the 
judgment-debtor  or"
"receive payments from him to her prejudice."
"In  the  case  of  Deshpande  v  S (1971)  13  JILI  153,  highlights  two  key"
"issues underlying the concept of locus standi. “The plaintiff  must have"
"some  grievance.  That 
is,  another  person’s  grievance 
cannot  be"
"prosecuted. But this does not apply to Habeas Corpus or Quo Warranto"
"writ orders. This is due to public freedom and public attention to state"
