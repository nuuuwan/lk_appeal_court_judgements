"A
ccording to witness PW4 Senaratna on 24/09/2006 the 1st Appellant had"
"confessed that the deceased was dumped in the well. In his evidence he had"
"further said that the 1st Appellant had told him that the deceased had died"
"two days prior to his confession to PW4. Hence, as per the confession of the"
"1st  Appellant  the  date  of  death  of  the  deceased  was  22/09/2006.  Not"
"establishing the time of death of the deceased is not so vital in this case."
"The post mortem examination was done on 26/09/2006. The JMO who had"
"performed the autopsy had stated that the deceased’s body was swollen, eye"
"was protrude, skin was white and greasy, Epidermis had been lost in most"
"part of the body. Marbling was also seen. With the changes of the deceased’s"
"body and the confession of the 1st Appellant the prosecution has established"
"the date of death of the deceased beyond reasonable grounds.  Hence this"
"ground also has no merit."
