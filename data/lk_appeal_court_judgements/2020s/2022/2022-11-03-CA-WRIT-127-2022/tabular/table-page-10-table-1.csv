"case for the prosecution that there is no evidence that the accused committed the offence.”"
"For the foregoing  reasons,  I take the view that there is no necessity for the General Court"
"Martial to issue a detailed order when exercising jurisdiction under Regulation 71(2) rejecting"

"Now I advert to examine the orders made by the General Court Martial in respect of the other"

"'P5b', in CA/Writ/117/2022 and CA/Writ/118/2022 respectively, that it is not the right time"
"to decide on the competence of the witness."
"The impugned order marked ‘P5b’ in the Application CA Writ 117/2022;"
