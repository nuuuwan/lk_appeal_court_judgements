"For the reasons set out above, I take the view that the impugned decisions of the respective"
"General Court Martial in respect of all three Applications were made after having followed"
"the  necessary  procedure  under  Regulation  71.  It  appears  that  the  2nd  Respondent  has"
"contemplated the undesirable effect of interfering with the evidence already led by not issuing"
"a detailed order when he  chose to take a decision under Regulation 71(2) to call upon the"
"defence. In the circumstances, I am of the view that the impugned decisions are ex facie not"
"ultra vires, unlawful or arbitrary as claimed by the Petitioner."
"Having considered carefully the facts and circumstances of this case along with the principles"
"enunciated  in  the  decisions  of  this  Court  and  the  Supreme  Court  as  cited  above,  I  am  not"
"inclined  to  issue  formal  notice  of  this  Application  to  the  Respondents  and  to  exercise  the"
"discretionary powers of this Court in favour of the Petitioner."
