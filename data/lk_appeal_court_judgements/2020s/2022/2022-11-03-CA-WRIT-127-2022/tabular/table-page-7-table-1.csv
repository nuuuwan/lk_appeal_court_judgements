"In this sense, it is necessary to assess whether the General Court Martial is duty bound to give"
"reasons expressly when it decides that a prima facie case has been made by the Prosecution"
"under Regulation 71(2). Perhaps, a reasonably detailed analysis may be necessary when the"
"Court Martial acquits the accused under Regulation 71(1). However, it cannot be assumed"
"that in view of the rational interpretation for the term ‘prima facie case’ that the Court Martial,"
"who exercises the jurisdiction under Regulation 71(2) in closed Court, is required to elaborate"
"reasons for the decision that there exists a prima facie case."
"When assessing whether there is a prima facie case, I take the view that the Court Martial"
"should not confine to the evidence led by the Prosecution but it can arrive at a conclusion that"
"there is a prima facie case even in order to examine the availability of further evidence. Thus,"
"it should not be the duty of the Court Martial to take a decision solely based on the evidence"
"adduced up to the conclusion of the Prosecution case."
"Even if I am to assume that the Court Martial in reference to an application under Regulation"
"71 should consider whether the case before it has a real prospect of success, the decision of"
"the Court Martial should be proportional  to the importance of the issues  involved and the"
"gravity of the charges. I have carefully perused the charges in all three applications and one"
"of the charges particularly grills not only his official conduct but also his moral conduct."
"At this stage, I need to draw my attention to the following passage of His Lordship Justice"
"Mahinda  Samayawardhena  in  Jagath  Kumara  Imaduwa  Vithane  vs.  The  Commander,  Sri"
"Lanka Army, CA/WRIT/354/2015 decided on 25.03.2019;"
