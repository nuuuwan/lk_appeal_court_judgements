"for the defence. The grounds for proceeding with the trial at the close of the case for the prosecution"
"means nothing more than that the High Court Judge CONSIDERING that there are grounds"
"for proceeding with the trial. The ordinary meaning of the word ‘CONSIDER’ as it occurs in"
"Section 22(1) would mean “to think about carefully”, especially in order to make a decision."
"Quite obviously, the Section does not make it obligatory on the part of the High Court Judge to"
"give reasons as to why he considers the case as disclosed by the prosecution merits further trial. If"
"elaborate reasons are required to be assigned before calling the defence, then, every High Court"
"criminal  trial  (without  a  jury)  ought  to  carry  two  Judgments,  one  at  the  close  of  the  case  for"
"prosecution and the other at the close of the defence, i.e under Sections 200 and 203 respectively.”"
