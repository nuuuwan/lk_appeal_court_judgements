"Attorney General (2010) BLR 169. The precedent of those cases cannot be directly adopted to"
"the issues of this case as the Court in said judgements  has not considered a situation as in"
"Regulation  71(2).  As  I  have  mentioned  earlier,  the  circumstances  of  a  decision  under"
"Regulation  71(2)  are  different  from  a  decision  under  Regulation  71(1).  Moreover,  such"
