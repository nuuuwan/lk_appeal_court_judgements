"Mahinda  Samayawardhena  in  Jagath  Kumara  Imaduwa  Vithane  vs.  The  Commander,  Sri"
"Lanka Army, CA/WRIT/354/2015 decided on 25.03.2019;"
"“The discipline of the Army is paramount importance, and shall be best left to the Commander"
"and not to the Court to deal with. If there is no discipline, there is no Army. The Court in the"
"exercise of writ jurisdiction will not interfere with the internal administration of the Army, which"
"includes  taking  disciplinary  decisions,  unless  there  are  compelling  cogent  reasons-such  as"
"decisions are ex facie ultra vires, unlawful and arbitrary-to do so. I see no such reasons in the case"
"at hand.”"
