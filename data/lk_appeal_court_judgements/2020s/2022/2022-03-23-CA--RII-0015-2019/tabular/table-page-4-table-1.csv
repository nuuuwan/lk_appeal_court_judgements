"a   preliminary   objection   by   the   plaintiff   respondent,   that,   the   said"
"second amended petition is not supported by way of an affidavit. But it"
"is   clear   that   the   original   petition   of   the   01st   defendant   seeking"
"Restitutio in Integrum etc., was supported by a valid affidavit and hence"
"the jurisdiction of this court has been validly invoked."
