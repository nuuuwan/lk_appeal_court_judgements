"27. Under the same heading the book says at page 541,"
"“   The   judge’s   confidence   in   his   ability   to   hear   a   matter   impartially"
"because   of   the   judge’s   training   and   experience   is   irrelevant   if   a"
"reasonable   onlooker   may   in   the   circumstances   of   the   case   doubt   his"
"impartiality. In  Johnson v District Court  of County of  Jefferson85  it was"
"held that although the judge is convinced of his or her own impartiality,"
"if it non the less appears to the parties or to the public that the judge"
"may be biased or prejudiced, the same harm to public confidence in the"
"administration of justice occurs. Public confidence in the impartiality of"
"the judiciary is the core issue. Thus in  Kandasamy Vs. Subramaniam86"
"despite   the   assurance   from   the   magistrate,   whom   the   Supreme   Court"
"described   as   ‘a   judge   of   considerable   experience   and   seniority   in   the"
"judicial service’, that he was confident that he could impartially hear and"
"decide   the   case,   the   court   allowed   an   application   to   have   the   case"
"transferred before another judge."
