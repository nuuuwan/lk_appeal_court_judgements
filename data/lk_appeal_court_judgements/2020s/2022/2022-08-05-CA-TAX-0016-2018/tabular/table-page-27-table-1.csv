"set  out  in  the document  presented  to  the  Assessor by  the  Appellant  (A15).  I"
"hold  that  “indenting”  is  a  service  provided  by  any  indenting  agent  to  any"
"supplier  in  return  for  a  commission  and 
therefore,  the 
indenting  agent 
is"
"entitled  to  avail  itself  of  the  exemption  in  terms  of  section  13  (dddd)  of  the"
"Inland Revenue Act."
"[77]  The  TAC  approached  this  question  on  the  basis  that  the  determinative"
"factor is the place where the service is consumed and utilized. On that basis,"
"the TAC held that the Appellant received commission income only as a result"
"of the goods purchased by the Ministry of Highways and the RDA to be used"
"in Sri Lanka, and therefore, no service was provided outside Sri Lanka. In the"
"present  case,  there  is  absolutely  nothing  to  show  that  the  Appellant  had"
"rendered  any  service 
to 
the 
local  branch  office  or  had  any  dealing  or"
"transaction  with  the  local  branch  office  that  gave  rise  to  the  payment  for"
"services rendered in Sri Lanka."
"[78] The total commission  income  received from all  six  companies  in foreign"
"currency, including from Mabey & Johnson Ltd, UK as per the document at p."
"399 of the TAC brief is Rs. 401,351,497 which is clearly stated in the financial"
"statement of the Appellant (p. 143 of the TAC brief). After deducting a sum of"
"Rs.  1,366,595  as  direct  expenses,  the  Appellant  has  claimed  a  sum  of  Rs."
"399,984,902  as  commission  income  under  section  13  (dddd)  of  the  Act  (p."
"143  of  the  TAC  brief  and  the  return  of  income  (Vide-  the  documentattached"
"with 
the  written  submissions  of 
the  Respondent).  The  Assessor  has  not"
"disputed  the  detailed  information  provided  by  the  Appellant  in  respect  of  the"
"agency  commission  received  from  Mabey  &  Johnson  Ltd,  UK  or  the  indent"
"commission received from fiveother companies in foreign currency as set out"
"in the document at p. 399 of the TAC brief)."
"[79]  During 
the  course  of 
the  argument, 
the 
learned  Additional  Solicitor"
"General  submitted  that  the  Appellant  had  paid  VAT  out  of  the  commission"
"income  received by  the  Appellant  and therefore,  the Appellant  is not  entitled"
"to  claim  the  tax  exemption  under  section  13  (dddd).  This  seems  to  be  the"
"identical stand taken by the Commissioner, referring to section 7 (1)(C) of the"
"VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002 in its determination at pp. 6-13 of the TAC brief. The"
"view  of  the  Commissioner  was 
that  the  payment  of  VAT  proves  that  the"
"service  has  been  consumed  and  utilized 
in  Sri  Lanka  and 
therefore, 
the"
"person to whom the service was rendered was a person in Sri Lanka."
"[80]  It  is relevant  to note  that  the  question  in  the present  case  is whether or"
"not the Appellant provided any service to Mabey & Johnson Ltd, UK and other"
"companies  within  the  meaning  of  section  13  (dddd)  of  the  Inland  Revenue"
"Act.  Section  7(1)(c)  of  the  VAT  Act  relied  on  by  the  Commissioner  reads  as"
"follows:"
