"aggravating  factor  when 
imposing 
the  sentence  on 
the  accused"
"respondents."
"27. The 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for 
the 
accused 
respondents"
"submitted 
that 
the 
lapse  of  a  15-year 
time  period 
after 
the"
"commission of the offence should be considered in awarding a non-"
"custodial sentence at this stage as that would affect the families of"
"the accused respondents. However, on perusal of the Court record, it"
"is  noted 
that 
the 
trial 
in 
the  High  Court  had  delayed 
for  a"
"considerable period of time due to the fact that one of the accused"
"was absconding, and on certain occasions some of the accused were"
"being absent taking turns."
"28. As mentioned in Section 303 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure"
"Act, the Court making an order suspending the whole or part of the"
"sentence  if  it  is  satisfied  should  state  the  reasons  in  writing.  The"
"learned  High  Court  Judge 
in 
this  case  has  failed 
to  give  such"
"reasons  as  to  why  the  sentences  were  suspended.  Section  303  (1)"
"provides the circumstances upon which the trial Judge may consider"
"suspending  the  sentence.  However,  out  of  the  factors  mentioned"
"from (a) to (k) in Section 303(1), only factors mentioned in (d) (for"
"some  of  the  accused  respondents)  and  (k)  can  be  considered  in"
"favour  of  the  accused  respondents.  Therefore,  the  factors  not  in"
"favour  of  the  accused  respondents  which  can  be  taken  against  the"
"accused respondents to impose a custodial term, override the factors"
"in  favour  of  the  accused  respondents,  including  the  lapse  of  time"
"after  commission  of  the  offence.  In  the  above  premise,  it  is  my"
"considered  view  that  the  sentences  imposed  by  the  learned  High"
"Court Judge on the accused respondents are too lenient and grossly"
"inadequate.  Therefore, 
the 
sentences 
imposed  on 
the  accused"
"respondents are set aside and the following sentences as ordered in"
"paragraphs 31 – 34 of the judgment are substituted. When imposing"
"the  sentences  all  aggravating  and  mitigating 
factors  mentioned"
"before, are considered."
"29. In  terms  of  Section  146  of  the  Penal  Code  when  an  offence  is"
"committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution"
"of  the  common  object  of  that  assembly,  every  person  who,  at  the"
"time  of  committing  of 
that  offence 
is  a  member  of 
the  same"
"assembly is guilty of that offence.  However, when deciding on the"
"sentence on each member, the Court will consider aggravating and"
"mitigating  factors  which  are  common  to  all  accused,  as  well  as"
"specific 
to 
each 
accused 
such 
as 
the 
degree 
or 
extent 
of"
"participation."
