"Respondent who was not in good terms with the 1st Petitioner in particular because of the"
"political opinion held by the Petitioner."
"However, I am not satisfied that the Petitioner has provided cogent & sufficient evidence"
"and material in this application in order to establish malice on the part of the 1st and the"
"4th Respondents. Sripavan J. in Bandaranayake vs. Judicial Service Commission (2003)"
"3
 Sri. L.R. 101  has held that the Court will not in general entertain allegations of bad"
"faith made against the repository of power, unless bad faith has been expressly pleaded"
"and properly enumerated in detail."
"On a careful consideration of the documentation tendered by the Petitioners, it is apparent,"
"that the Petitioner has been allowed to use the subject State Land only on temporary basis"
"for the storage of building material. Though the Petitioners have made representations to"
"the relevant authorities requesting the said subject land to be given to him on a long term"
"lease, none of the authorities have officially agreed to such requests."
"The Chairmanâ€™s (of RDA) authority to grant temporary permission for the 1st Petitioner"
"to occupy the subject state land is also, in my view, questionable. Granting of State land"
"on lease or otherwise for a short/long term should be done according to the written laws"
"relating  to  State  lands.  The  material  submitted  by  the  1st  Petitioner  to  establish  his"
"expectation to get the subject land on a long term lease is not strong enough for this Court"
"to exercise its writ jurisdiction to grant a prerogative remedy quashing the impugned quit"
"notices.  In  the  circumstances,  I  refuse  to  issue  formal  notice  of  this  application  on  the"
"Respondents  as  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to  submit  a  prima  facie  case.  Application  is"
"refused."
