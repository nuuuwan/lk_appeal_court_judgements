"not yet made a decision under Article 161 (d) (iii) to require the Secretary of “the"
"political party to which such member belonged to nominate a member of such"

"As that situation has not yet arisen, the application is premature."
"DR. Sunil Cooray in his book entitled “Administrative Law” 4th Edition Vol. 2 at"
"page  1153  states  thus,  “For  certiorari  to 
issue,  there  must  already  be  a"
"determination of rights and not a mere decision on a question of law which may"
"ultimately be the basis of the later determination of rights.”"
"The  Respondents, 
in  their  Statement  of  Objections,  have  stated  that  the"
