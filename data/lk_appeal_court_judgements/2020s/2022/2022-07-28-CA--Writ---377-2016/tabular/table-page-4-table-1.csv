"purposes was the Customs itself. It is the Customs appraisers who determine the"
"appropriate HS Code after the physical examination of the cargo. If there was"
"any  lapse  on  the  part  of  the  Customs  appraisers,  the  Customs  Department"
"should take the full responsibility for such shortcomings and not the importer."
"It is the case of the Petitioner that if there was any lapse on the determination"
"of the commodity classifications the proper process is to initiate proceedings to"
"recover  the  short  levies  under  Section  18  (2)  of  the  Customs  Ordinance.  The"
"Petitioner states that the Customs having realized that there was a lapse on the"
"part  of  the  Customs  appraisers  informed  the  Petitioner  that  the  commodity"
"classification  approved  by  the  customs  appraisers  was  inappropriate  for  the"
"commodity Eau de Toilette and made an order to release the shipment subject"
"to the recovery of additional levies under the HS code 33030029. The Petitioner"
"had complied with the said determination and cleared the shipment on payment"
"of additional levies. Thereafter the same group of officers from the preventive"
"directorate had issued summons on the Petitioner requiring him to attend to"
"another inquiry into the same matter. At the said inquiry a request had been"
"made on behalf of the Petitioner to the 2nd Respondent to inform the Petitioner"
"as to why he was summoned to attend the inquiry and the violation committed"
"by  the  Petitioner  under  the  Customs  Ordinance.  But  the  2nd  Respondent  had"
"refused to comply with that request claiming that the aforesaid customs inquiry"
"was  merely  a  fact-finding  inquiry.  The  Petitioner  states  that  in  all  cases  of"
"disputed  classifications  detected  after  the  release  of  the  goods,  the  proper"
"procedure  shall  be  to  refer  the  matter  to  customs  post  clearance  and  audit"
"directorate for follow up actions. The Petitioner therefore states that the whole"
"process adapted against him to conduct a formal inquiry is not warranted by law"
"and amounts to abuse and exceeding or misusing of the powers vested in the"
"2nd Respondent and therefore becomes unlawful and of no force in law. The said"
"decision offends the principle of reasonableness and fairness and is irrational."
"The 1st to 3rd Respondents are seeking for a dismissal of this application for the"
"reasons stated in their statement of objections. The Respondents have taken up"
"the following preliminary objections."
