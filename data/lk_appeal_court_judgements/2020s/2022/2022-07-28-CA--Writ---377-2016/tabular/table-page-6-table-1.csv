"were imposed not immediately after the Section 8 Inquiry but upon show cause"
"notices being served on the parties identified at the Section 8 inquiry. In the case"
"of  Tennakoon  v  Director  General  of  Customs  and  another  C.A  856/2000"
"decided  on  8.9.2003  after  an 
inquiry  under  Section  8  (1)  of  the  Customs"
"Ordinance a charge under Section 119 of the Customs Ordinance was framed"
"against  the  Petitioner  and  importer.  After  the  inquiry,  an  order  was  made"
"declaring the vehicle in question forfeited in terms of Section 119 of the Customs"
"Ordinance."
"Therefore, it is clear that the Section 8 Inquiry under the Customs Ordinance is"
"a fact-finding inquiry which is a precursor to a formal inquiry."
"Section 8 of the Customs Ordinance reads as follows:-"
"8. 
Director-General  may  examine  witnesses  on  oath.  False  oath  deemed"
"false evidence."
"(1) 
Upon examinations and inquiries made by the Director-General, or other"
"principal  officer  of  Customs,  or  other  persons  appointed 
to  make  such"
"examinations and inquiries for ascertaining the truth of the statements made"
"relative to Customs, or the conduct of officers or persons employed therein, any"
"person examined before him or them as a witness shall deliver his testimony on"
"oath, to be administered by such Director General or other principal officer, or"
"such  other  persons  as  shall  examine  any  such  witness,  who  are  hereby"
"authorized  to  administer  such  oath  and  if  such  person  shall  be  convicted  of"
"giving false evidence on his examination on oath before such Director-General"
"or other principal officer of customs, or such other person in conformity to the"
"directions of this Ordinance, every such person so convicted as aforesaid shall"
"be deemed guilty of the offence of giving false evidence in a judicial proceeding,"
"and  shall  be  liable  to  the  fines  and  penalties  to  which  persons  are  liable  for"
"intentionally giving false evidence in judicial proceedings.‚Äù"
"Thus, it is  abundantly clear that the purpose of a section 8 inquiry under the"
"Customs Ordinance is to ascertain the truth of statements made relative to the"
"Customs  and  the  only  penal  section  contained  in  that  section  is  the  penalty"
"prescribed for the offence of giving false evidence on oath."
"The Petitioner is seeking to quash the decision of the Respondents to hold an"
"inquiry under Section 8 of the Customs Ordinance. That decision is not a decision"
"which  affects  the  rights  of  the  Petitioner.  In  the  case  of  Rex  v  Electricity"
"Commissioner (1924) 1 KB 171, Lord Atkin expressed the following view:-"
