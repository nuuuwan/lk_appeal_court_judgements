"6.","The 
learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  conceded"
"","that  the  grounds  of  appeal  urged  by  the  appellant"
"","have merit, in particular, that the defence evidence"
"","was  not  properly  challenged  by  the  prosecution  at"
"","the trial."
"7.","In  his  evidence,  PW1  clearly  said 
that  he  was"
"","unaware  of  the  fact  that  the  brother-in-law  of  the"
"","appellant  was  arrested  on  the  same  day  as  the"
"","appellant.  The  position  taken  up  by  the  appellant"
"","at the trial was that, the police officer Munasinghe"
"","came  to  the  river  bank  and  arrested  him  while  he"
"","was  loading  sand.  PW1  as  well  as  PW2  in  their"
"","evidence 
have 
testified 
that 
Sub-Inspector"
"","Munasinghe also participated in the raid (pages 54"
"","and 
87 
of 
the 
appeal 
brief).  However,  Sub-"
"","listed  as  a 
Inspector  Munasinghe  was  not  even"
"","witness in the indictment."
"8.","The  appellant  has 
testified  as 
to  how  he  was"
"","arrested  by  the  police  while  he  was  loading  sand."
"","His  evidence  was  corroborated  by 
two  defence"
"","witnesses  who  were  loading  sand  with  him.  The"
"","learned  High  Court 
Judge 
has 
given 
undue"
"","prominence  to  a  minor  discrepancy  between  the"
"","two 
defence  witnesses 
with 
regard 
to 
their"
"","evidence.  One  witness  has  said 
that  when 
the"
"","police  came,  they  were  resting  after  loading  the"
"","sand,  and 
the  other  has  said 
that 
they  were"
"","arrested  whilst 
loading  the  sand.  The  witnesses"
"","have  given  evidence  after  a  lapse  of  about  fifteen"
"","years.  The  minor  discrepancy  noted  above,  would"
"","not  affect  the  credibility  of  those  two  witnesses  to"
"","disregard their evidence."
"9.","The PW1 has clearly stated in his evidence, that he"
"","was  unaware  of  the  fact  that  the  brother-in-law  of"
"","the  appellant had  also  been  arrested  by  the  police"
"","on 
the  same  day.  Nonetheless, 
there 
is  ample"
"","evidence  to  confirm  that  the  brother-in-law  of  the"
