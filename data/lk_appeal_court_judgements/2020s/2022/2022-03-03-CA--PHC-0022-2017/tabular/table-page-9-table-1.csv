"Since, the information was filed on 31.03.2014, it is apparent in terms of Section 68(1) of the Act,"
"that the 2nd Party-1st Respondent-Respondent was in possession of the premises in dispute as at the"
"date of filing of the information under Section 66 of the Act."
"T
herefore, the learned Magistrate has erred in law and facts by failing to determine the possession"
"of the 2nd Party-1st Respondent-Respondent and by not making any order in respect of the 2nd Party-"
"1st Respondent’s entitlement to the possession of the premises in dispute in terms of the provisions"
"of Part VII of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979."
"I
n  view  of  the  foregoing  reasons,  I  hold  that  the  order  of  the  learned  Primary  Court  Judge  is"
"erroneous. Since the learned High Court Judge has affirmed the said order of the learned Primary"
"Court Judge, I hold that the learned High Court Judge too was  wrong. Thus, we set aside both"
"orders of the Primary Court as well as the High Court Judge."
"H
ence,  I  hold  that  the  2nd Party-1st  Respondent-Respondent  is  entitled  to  the  possession  of  the"
"premise  bearing  No.  359,  Navayalatenne,  in  terms  of  Section  68(1)  of  the  Primary  Courts’"
"Procedure Act."
"Therefore, we set aside the order dated 29.08.2014 made by the learned Magistrate and the order"
"dated 06.03.2017 by the learned High Court Judge and decide this appeal in favour of the Party of"
"the 2nd Part-1st Respondent-Respondent. No cost of appeal is awarded. Parties have to bear their"
"own costs."
