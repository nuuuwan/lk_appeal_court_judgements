"possession  and  prohibiting  all  disturbance  of  such  possession  otherwise  than  under  the"
"authority of an order or decree of a competent Court."
"Accordingly,  the  main  issue  for  the  determination  under  Section  68(1)  is,  as  to  who  was  in"
"possession  of  the  land  or  part  thereof  on  the  date  of  filing  the  information  under  Section  66."
"However, when there is an allegation of a forcible dispossession, the Court can act under Section"
"68(3) and make a determination as to whether such dispossession has been affected within two"
"months prior to filing of the information."
"It was the contention of the Respondents that the Appellantâ€™s claim is entirely based on forcible"
"dispossession.  It  is  apparent  that  in  such  circumstances,  Section  68(3)  of  the  Act  applies  and"
"therefore, the learned Magistrate has quite  correctly proceeded to  inquire whether requisites of"
"Section 68(3) have been met."
