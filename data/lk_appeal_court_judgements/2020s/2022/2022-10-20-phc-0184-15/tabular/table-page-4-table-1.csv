"filed an affidavit to show that the omission  was due to his own illness and was a cause"
"beyond the control of his client.  Justice Wanasundara observed;"
"“I find that Section 759(2) is adequate to deal with an application of this kind and"
"it is precisely to these provisions that a person such as the present appellant must"
"look for relief. In my view, the facts of that case have no bearing to the instant"
"case. It is my view that the presence of the Petitioner was not essential to present"
"the petition of appeal. The Attorney at Law on record had the full authority to file"
"the  petition  of  appeal.  It  is  the  Attorney  at  Law  on  record  who  has  to  file  the"
"petition  of  appeal  and  specify  the  grounds  of  objection  to  the  Judgment.  The"
"absence or the presence of the Petitioner in person is immaterial to the filing of"
"the petition of appeal. It is my view that the provisions of Section 759(2) cannot"
"be invoked to condone the negligence and carelessness of the Attorney at Law on"
"record.”"
