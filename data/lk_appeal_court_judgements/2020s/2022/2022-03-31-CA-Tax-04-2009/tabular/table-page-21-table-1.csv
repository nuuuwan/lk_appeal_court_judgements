"the goods are kept in the customs clearance station, then, the goods shall"
"be deemed to have been in the export stream."
"[58] The said case  related to the refusal of the deduction claimed by the"
"assessee  under Section  80HHC   of  The 
Income-  Tax  Act,  1995  placing"
"reliance  on  Explanation  (aa)  to Section  80HHC(4A) of  the  Act.   The  said"
"Section  provides that ""'export out of India' shall not include any transaction"
"by  way  of 
sale  or  otherwise, 
in  a 
shop,  emporium  or  any  other"
"establishment  situate  in  India,  not 
involving  clearance  at  any  customs"
"station  as  defined  in  the Customs  Act,  1962  (52  of  1962).""  There  was  no"
"dispute  in  that  case  that  transactions  of  counter  sales  effected  by  the"
"respondent involved customs clearance within the meaning of Explanation"
"(aa)  to Section  80HHC  (4A) of  the  Act,  and  further  that  the  sales  were  in"
"convertible foreign exchange."
"[59] 
If  the  above 
interpretation  applies  to  the  export 
in  question  as"
"projected  by  Dr.  Felix  in  the  written  submissions  filed  on  behalf  of  the"
"Appellant, then, it would mean that irrespective of the condition in Sections"
"15 (j) or 47 of the Inland Revenue Act,  the delivery of goods shall be after"
"customs clearance, i.e., after goods have cleared all local customs and all"
"other legal formalities and are kept ready for delivery to the ship’s tanks,"
"the Appellant would qualify for the concessionary tax rates under Section"
"47 or exemption under Section 15 (j) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of"
"2000 (as amended)."
"[60] In my opinion, the concept sought to put in service in CIT v. Silver and"
"Arts Palace (supra)  cannot be applied to the facts of this case and therefore,"
"the  submission  of  customs  clearance 
(bill  of  entry)  per  se  does  not"
"constitute an Appellant an exporter of the bunker fuel under Sections 15 (j)"
"or 47  of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 (as amended)."
"Use of Foreign Currency"
"[61] The learned Counsel for the Appellant citing the Exchange Control Act,"
"No. 24 of 1953, as amended, submitted that the fact that the Appellant is"
"permitted  by  the  Central  Bank  to  accept  foreign  currency  payments  for"
"supplies  of  marine  bunker  fuel  to  ships  travelling  in  international  waters"
"supports  the  position  of  the  Appellant  that  the  sales  undertaken  by  the"
"Appellant are not local sales but are in fact exports. He submitted that it is"
"an  offence  to  accept  foreign  currency  for  a  local  sale  and  therefore,  this"
"transaction should be construed to be an export."
