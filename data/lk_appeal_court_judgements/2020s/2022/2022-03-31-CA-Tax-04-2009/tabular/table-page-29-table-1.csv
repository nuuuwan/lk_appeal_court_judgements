"Section  2  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  and  the  rate  of  income  tax  varies"
"subject to the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act.  Customs Duty is a tax"
"imposed on imports and exports of goods under the Customs Ordinance"
"when  they  are  transported  across  international  borders  and  the  rate  of"
"Customs duty varies subject to the provisions of the Customs Ordinance."
"[79] When the provisions of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act are read"
"and construed  with the Customs Ordinance, the goods either prohibited"
"or restricted by the provisions of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act shall"
"be  deemed  to  be  the  goods  prohibited  or  restricted  by  the  Customs"
"Ordinance. The Customs Ordinance takes care of levy of import of goods"
"or export of goods and thus, the taxable event for levy of custom duty and"
"entry tax are different and distinct. The  ""pith and substance"" and ""aspect"""
"of custom levy, as regards both imports and exports in terms of restrictions,"
"prohibition and permissibility are different and distinct from the charging"
"of income tax under the Inland Reveue Act."
"[80]  The  learned  counsel  for  the  Appellant  submits  that  the  definition  of"
"""export"" as defined in Section 22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act"
"does not include ""place of destination” but only “Taking out of Sri Lanka or"
"causing to be carried or taken  out of Sri Lanka” and, therefore, the concept"
"of destination on the supply of bunker fuel to a ship is  clearly beyond the"
"ambit  of  Inland  Revenue  Act.  In  my  view,  Section  22  of  the  Imports  and"
"Exports (Control) Act or the Customs Ordinance  has no overriding effect"
"over the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act and the imposition of income"
"tax under the provisions of the said Acts are based on different principles"
"and the fulfilment of different conditions."
"[81]  If  the  Legislature  intended  to  apply  the  same  term  “export”  for  the"
"purpose of Sections 15 (j) or 47 of the Inland Revenue Act, the Legislature"
"could have easily used the same meaning as defined in Section 22 of the"
"Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969. Thus, the argument of the"
"Appellant that since the place of destination is not specifically mentioned"
"in  the  definition  of  ""export""  in  Section  22    of  the  Imports  and  Exports"
"(Control) Act, it will give rise to the inference that Legislature intended not"
"make  the  concept  of  destination  as  a  requirement  of  export  for  the"
"purposes  of  Sections  15  (j)    or  47  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  is  without"
"substance."
