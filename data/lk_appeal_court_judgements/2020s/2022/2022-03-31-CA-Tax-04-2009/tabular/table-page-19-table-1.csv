"[51]  As  noted,  for  the  purpose  of  the  protection  of  government  revenue"
"and  prevention  of  any  loss  of  revenue  to  the  Government,  the  date  of"
"importation or exportation of goods, the date of delivery are relevant to the"
"levying or charging any tax, duty, surcharge, levy or other charge under the"
"Customs Ordinance. Those  principles are, however, not applicable to the"
"interpretation of the term “export” under Section 15 (j) or 47 of the Inland"
"Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000."
"[52]  Accordingly,  for  the  purpose  of  levying  or  repealing  of  any  customs"
"duty  upon 
the 
first  permitting  or  prohibiting  of  any 
importation  or"
"exportation  of    prohibited/restricted  goods  and  goods  illegally  imported,"
"the time of importation shall be the time at which the ship importing such"
"goods had actually come within  the  limits of the port at which such ship"
"shall be reported and such goods be discharged. In case of exportation of"
"prohibited/restricted  goods  and  goods 
illegally  exported, 
the 
time  of"
"exportation  shall  be  the  time  at  which  the  goods  had  been  shipped  on"
"board the ship."
"[53]  To  constitute  an  export  under  Section  22  of  the  Import  and  Export"
"(Control) Act, the goods must be either taken out of the territory of Sri Lanka"
"or caused to be taken out of Sri Lanka, by sea or air of such goods.   This"
"means that the mere delivery of the bunker fuel into the tanks of the ship"
"is  insufficient  to  constitute  an  export  unless  such  fuel  had  been  either"
"actually taken out of Sri Lanka or caused to be taken out of Sri Lanka on a"
"ship bound for a place out of Sri Lanka."
"[54] The Imports  and Exports  (Control) Act is intended to  provide  for the"
"control of the importation and exportation of goods and regulation of the"
"standards of exportable goods. The  provisions of the Imports and Exports"
"(Control)  Act  shall  be,  however,  read    and  construed  with  the  Customs"
"Ordinance as set out in Section 21 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act."
"In  terms  of  Section  21  of  the 
Imports  and  Exports 
(Control)  Act,  the"
"provisions of the Act “shall be construed with the Customs Ordinance and"
"for the purpose of the application of the Customs Ordinance-"
