"export such as (i) there  should be an act of taking out of Sri Lanka; (ii) the"
"goods must reach a final destination outside Sri Lanka; (iii) the transaction"
"must  involve  an  export  from  one  country,  and  an  import  into  another"
"country;  and  (iv)  the  transaction  should  possess  the  characteristics  of  an"
"international sale of goods trsnsaction."
"[13] She submitted that the Appellant neither  took the goods outside Sri"
"Lanka, nor caused the foreign vessel to take the goods outside Sri Lanka"
"with a final destination outside Sri Lanka as the contracts entered by the"
"Appellant do not provide for a terminus outside the territorial waters of Sri"
"Lanka.  She  submitted  that  as  far  as  the  Appellant  was  concerned,  the"
"terminus was within Sri Lanka, and the  transaction  between the Appellant"
"and the vessel  owners/charterers was  a local transaction that took place"
"within the territorial waters of Sri Lanka and thus, the final destination was"
"not  outside  Sri  Lanka.  She 
further  submitted  that 
in  any  event,  the"
"Appellant had no control over the ships’ journeys; and thus, it is manifest"
"that  the  goods  have  remained  within  the  territorial  waters  of  Sri  Lanka,"
"indefinitely."
"[14]  Referring  to  the  test  of  international  sale  of  goods  transaction,  she"
"argued that the Appellant has failed to produce a single document such as"
"a Bill of Lading, Marine Insurance, invoices and letters of credit, and that"
"the  Appellant’s  documents  do  not  support  that  its  transaction  could  be"
"chaterertised  as 
international  sale  of  goods 
transaction.  She  argued"
"therefore, that the supply of bunker fuel was no export within the meaning"
"of Section 47 or Section 15 (j) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 (as"
"amended)."
"[15] The Board of Review in holding that the bunker fuel supplied by the"
"Appellant to ships travelling from Sri Lanka cannot constitute an export in"
"the  absence  of  a 
foreign  destination,  relied  on 
the 
test  adopted  by"
"Hidayatullah  J.    in  the  Indian  Supreme  Court  case  in  Burmah-Shell Oil"
"Storage & Distribution Company Ltd v. Commercial Taxing Office and Othes"
"[1961]1SCR 902. That was a case relating to the sale and delivery of aviation"
"spirits to Aircrafts proceeding abroad and belonging to several companies."
"The question arose was whether the sale and delivery of aviation spirits to"
"Aircrafts constitutes an export."
