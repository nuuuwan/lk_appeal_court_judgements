"But, if the prosecution fails to adduce cogent and consistent evidence, then"
"the court has no option but to award the benefit of the doubt to the Appellant."
"Further, in an appeal against conviction, the Appellate Court has the duty"
"to itself appreciate the evidence on the record and if two views are possible"
"on the appraisal of the evidence, the benefit of reasonable doubt has to be"
"given  to  an  accused.  Therefore,  examining  the  evidence  presented  by  the"
"Appellant, as well as discovering and assessing materials favourable to the"
"Appellant, must thus be thoroughly considered before the court may reach"
"a final determination."
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  in  his  judgment  had  considered  the  dock"
"statement and correctly discussed the stance the Appellant had taken up in"
"his dock statement. Hence, as the stances taken up by the Appellant in his"
"dock  statement  does  not  override  the  prosecution  case,  the  Learned  High"
"Court  Judge  had  relied  upon  the  evidence  of  prosecution  as  reliable  and"
"come  to  his  decision  that  the  Appellant  is  guilty  to  the  charges  levelled"
"against him.  Hence, the Appellant is not successful in his second ground."
