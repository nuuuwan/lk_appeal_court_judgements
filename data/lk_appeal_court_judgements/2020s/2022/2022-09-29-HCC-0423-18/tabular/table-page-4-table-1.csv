"had taken the production and the Appellant to the Police Narcotics Bureau"
"on the following day. At the Police Narcotic Bureau, the contents of the all"
"350 packets were weighed together and the sum of weight of the substance"
"was observed to be  13.520  grams and the production was sealed  again in"
"front  of  the  Appellant  at  the  Police  Narcotic  Bureau.  After  sealing,  the"
"production was handed over to PW9 PS 10895 Gunasena under production"
"No.148  and  149.  Production  No.148/96  contained  the  substances  which"
"reacted for Heroin and Production No.149/96 contained the 350 metal foils"

"PW2,  SI/Herath  who  was  a  member  of  the  raiding  team,  was  called  to"
"corroborate the evidence given by PW1."
"After  closing  the  case  for  the  prosecution,  as  the  evidence  led  by  the"
"prosecution  warranted  the  presence  of  a  case  to  be  answered  by  the"
"Appellant, the learned High Court Judge called for the defence. The Appellant"
"made a dock statement and closed the case for the defence."
"In  all  criminal  cases  the  burden  always  rests  upon  the  shoulder  of  the"
"prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The Appellant is not"
"required to prove his innocence but if he decides to plead a general or special"
"exception of the Penal Code, then the Appellant has a duty of establishing"
"that the case of the Appellant comes within such exceptions. This burden is"
"imposed under Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"In the first ground of appeal the learned Counsel for the Appellant contended"
"whether the item of evidence is not sufficient to prove the prosecutionâ€™s case"
"against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt."
"The witnesses called by the prosecution had given cogent and consistence"
"evidence with regard to the raid and recovery of the productions. The learned"
"High  Court  Judge  had  very  correctly  analysed  the  evidence  in  its  correct"
"perspective to reach his conclusion. When examining the evidence presented"
"by both parties, it revealed that the defence had not challenged the evidence"
