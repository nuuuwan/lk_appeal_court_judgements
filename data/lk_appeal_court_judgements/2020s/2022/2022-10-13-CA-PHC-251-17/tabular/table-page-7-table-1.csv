"offence being committed. There are no reasons to believe that the offence had"
"been committed with any implied consent by him either."
"It is clear that the appellant has given this vehicle and two other vehicles to a 3rd"
"party for the transportation of tea leaves and to pay the lease rental through the"
"income generated by that business. The appellant had been truthful that during"
"the time relevant to this incident, he had permitted the mentioned 3rd party to"
"use it for any other legal purposes, and in fact it was used by a road construction"
"company."
"I  am  unable  to  find  any  reason  to  believe  that  the  appellant  encouraged  any"
"person to earn money through illegal means in order to pay the lease rental to"
"the leasing company."
"Under the circumstances, I am of the view that the term mentioned in section"
"40 of the Forest Ordinance, which reads that ‘the owner should prove that he"
"had  taken  all  precautions  to  prevent  the  use  of  such  vehicle’  should  be"
"looked at according to the facts and the circumstances of  each  vehicle owner."
"When  it  comes  to  the  facts  and  the  circumstances  of  the  appellant,  it  is"
"undoubted that he was not in a position to keep an eye on each of his vehicles"
"continuously, rather than relying on the persons to whom he has assigned the"
"vehicles for the intended purpose. It is obvious that he had to rely on the trust"
"and the confidence placed by him on such persons. I am of the view that when"
"such a person breaks the confidence placed on him by the appellant and engages"
"in illegal activities without his knowledge and consent, the appellant should not"
"be penalized for such activities."
"At  this  juncture,  I  would  like  to  reproduce  the  judgement  pronounced  in  the"
"Court  of  Appeal  by  A.W.A.  Salam,  J.  in  Case  No.  CA/PHC/108/2010  dated"
"26-08-2014,  which  refers  to  the  mode  of  proof  that  is  required  in  an  inquiry"
"under the Forest Ordinance:"
