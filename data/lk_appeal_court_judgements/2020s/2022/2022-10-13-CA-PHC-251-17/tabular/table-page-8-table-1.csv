"basis on which the learned Magistrate has entered an order for confiscation"
"on the merits of the inquiry. It  was the evidence of the owner that he had"
"given  instructions  to  the  employee  (driver)  not  to  engage  the  lorry  for  any"
"other purpose other than to transport items which do not require a permit."
"The 
testimony  of 
the  owner  has  not  been  discredited  under  cross-"
"examination.  There  has  been  no  previous  instance  where  the  driver  has"
"been charged for similar offences."
"When  someone  is  under  a  duty  to  show  cause  that  he  has  taken  all"
"precautions against the commission of similar offences, I do not think that"
"he  can  practically  do  many  things  than  to  give  specific  instructions.  The"
"owner  of  the  lorry  cannot  be  seated  all  the  time  in  the  lorry  to  closely"
"supervise for what purpose the lorry is used. In an order of confiscation of"
"the vehicle, then however much the owner comes forward and says that he"
"gave  instructions  not  to  make  use  of  the  vehicle  for  illegal  purposes,  by"
"reason of the fact that he is on the monthly payment, the vehicle has to be"
"confiscated. This approach does not appear to be reasonable and acceptable"
"in law. In an inquiry of this nature, what the owner has to prove is that he"
"took  every  measure  to  ensure  that  the  vehicle 
is  not  used  for 
illegal"
"purposes.‚Äù"
