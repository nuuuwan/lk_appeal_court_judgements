"injuries to the neck. It was also her position that witness PW-01 has failed to"
"explain the reasons as to why she did not see the other injuries being caused to"
"the deceased, if she really saw what happened."
"In the contradiction marked V-05, the witness had stated to the police that the"
"appellant  attacked  the  deceased  and  her  grandmother  over  her  head  using  a"
"mamoty, although she denied stating so in giving evidence before the High Court."
"It  was  the  position  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  that  this  was  a"
"contradiction that goes onto the root of the matter."
"It was the contention that when considered together, a doubt would invariably"
"be created as to whether PW-01 who was the sole eyewitness to the incident has"
"actually  seen  what  happened  or  whether  she  has  narrated  in  her  evidence"
"something she never actually witnessed. It was the view of the learned Counsel"
"for the appellant that this doubt should have been considered in the favour of"
"the appellant by the learned High Court Judge."
"However, it needs to be said that it was admitted by the learned Counsel that"
"the appellant failed to put forward his defence to the relevant witnesses when"
"they were giving evidence, but only had taken up that in his dock statement. The"
"learned Counsel also admitted that when the appellant was arrested a day after"
"the incident in a paddy field and taken to the hospital, it has been discovered"
"that he has consumed poison for which the appellant has failed to provide an"
"explanation."
"It  was  the  position  of  the  learned  Additional  Solicitor  General  (ASG)  that  the"
"reason for the PW-01’s failure to see all the injuries caused to the deceased was"
"obvious as she has fled the scene of crime as soon as she saw the deceased being"
"attacked and fell onto the bed in the room where she was attacked. The learned"
"ASG pointed out the fact that the sole eye witness was just 11 years old when"
"she  saw  her  grandmother  and  the  father’s  sister  being  attacked.  It  was  the"
"position of the learned ASG that given her age and the time gap before she could"
"give evidence in Court, there can be inevitable contradictions and omissions in"
