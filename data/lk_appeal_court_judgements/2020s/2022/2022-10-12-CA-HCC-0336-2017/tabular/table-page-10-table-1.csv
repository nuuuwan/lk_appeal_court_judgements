"established that injury number 1, 2, and 3 had been to the lower  back of the"
"head inflicted with a blunt force which is very much consistent with the evidence"
"of PW-01. The JMO has observed four other injuries to the back shoulders and"
"back left hand, which are also consistent with the evidence of PW-01where she"
"has stated that the deceased fell onto the bed when she was first attacked on the"
"back of the neck."
"As discussed earlier, I am unable to find any plausible, reasonable doubts in the"
"case of the prosecution as contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant."
"The appellant has spoken about an alibi only when he was called upon to present"
"his defence at the conclusion of the prosecution case. He has failed to put across"
"this when the relevant witnesses gave evidence or to cross-examine them on that"
"line. PW-01 in her evidence clearly states that in fact the appellant came home"
"after attending a funeral and was looking for something just before the attack on"
"the deceased and her mother. It was also her evidence that the deceased went to"
"the police and made a complaint with regard to the threats made by him to the"
"deceased that he would kill her, after the appellant went to attend the funeral."
"None  of  these  pieces  of  evidence  had  been  confronted  and  challenged  by  the"
"appellant when he had the chance to challenge such evidence."
"It is settled law that any position taken up by an accused person in a criminal"
"trial, must be put to the relevant witnesses when they give evidence in a trial,"
"which the appellant has failed to avail of. I find that the position taken up by the"
"appellant was an afterthought and nothing else."
"It is trite law that any stand taken by an accused in a case must be put to the"
"witnesses for them to respond to that position."
