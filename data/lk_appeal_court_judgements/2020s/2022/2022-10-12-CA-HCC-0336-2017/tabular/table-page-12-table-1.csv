"adversely to his interest.” – Rex Vs. Lord Cochrane and Others  (1814)"
"Gurney’s Report 479"
"It was the position of the appellant that when he came home from the funeral,"
"he found his wife and mother-in-law fallen with injuries. If that was the case, it"
"would have the normal reaction of a reasonably prudent person to assist others"
"or to act by himself to take the injured to the hospital for medical attention."
"According to the evidence of the police officers who conducted the investigation,"
"they have managed to arrest the appellant only a day after the incident while he"
"was in a paddy field in a state where he could not get up, whereupon he was"
"admitted  to  the  hospital.  According  to  the  evidence  of  the  police  officer  who"
"arrested the appellant, he has come to know that the appellant has consumed"
"poison  after  the  incident.  The  appellant  has  never  denied  that  he  consumed"
"poison and was admitted to the hospital by the police after his arrest. Under the"
"circumstances, the reasons for the appellant to consume poison was a matter"
"that  only  the  appellant  can  explain.  The  appellant  should  have  explained  to"
"Court the reasons, which has not been done."
"For the reasons considered above, I find no merit in any of the grounds of appeal"
"advanced by the learned Counsel for the appellant."
"The appeal, therefore, is dismissed. The conviction and the sentence affirmed."
