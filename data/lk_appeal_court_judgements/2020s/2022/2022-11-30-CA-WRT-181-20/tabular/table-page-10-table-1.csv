"he correctly formed an opinion that the land was state land and that the occupants were"
"not in lawful occupation. It is this action of the competent authority and not the Divisional"
"Secretary that is sought to be impugned. The issue does not concern the cancellation of"
"permits. This objection cannot be maintained."
"If  there  is a  valid  permit  then, it is  manifest  that  the  1st  Respondent  has  acted"
"illegally. It is tantamount to an abuse of power. There is only one right answer in this"
"case to remedy the malady caused at the hands of the Respondent and that is to quash"
"the Quit Notice."
"In  passing,  one  observation  must  be  made  on  the  formation  of  an  opinion  of"
"whether a land is a State land (the first limb). If the land in question has been alienated"
"by a permit under the Land Development Ordinance, as in the present case, the competent"
"authority would not have to formulate whether the land is State land, as if it is not State"
"land, it could not have been alienated under a permit in the first place.  If a competent"
"authority opines that the land alienated is not a State land, that would only mean that"
"the land in question could not have been alienated under a permit in the first place. If,"
"however, there is no permit issued, then there would be a necessity to form an opinion"
"that the land is State land."
"This judgment does not in any way prevent a Quit Notice from being served on the"
"Petitioner afresh if the due process of law is followed. If the land concerned is forest land"
"and one which should be preserved, then it is for the Respondents to act in accordance"
"with the due process of law by taking steps to revoke the permit. This raises the question"
"of how the land was alienated on a permit in the first place if it is land that ought to be"
"preserved  and  protected.  The  enormous  responsibility  with  which  the  authorities must"
"perform the functions expected of them, especially when dealing with State lands, and the"
"care  and  diligence  that  they  must  exercise,  and  that  which  is  expected  of  them,  is"
"unequivocal. It is ultimately the impoverished who are left helpless when authorities do"
"not act in accordance with the law, especially those who do not have the means to battle"
"it out in Court."
"We  observed  that in  the journal  entries  of  the  Fundamental  Rights  Application"
"(SC FR No. 192/2012) lodged by the Petitioner (annexed to the Petition as “P-2(b)”), which"
"is  pending  before  that  Court,  there  appears  to  be  an  indication  of  a  settlement  to  be"
"effected by allocating suitable alternate land to the Petitioner. If by due process of law the"
"permits are cancelled, when such cancellation is owing to no fault of the  permit holder,"
