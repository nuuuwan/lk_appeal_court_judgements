"In the case of Attorney General v. Wilson Silva (1992) 1 SLR  48 Justice Grero stated, “The"
"petitioner has not satisfied this Court with a reasonable explanation regarding the impossibility"
"of obtaining such copies in order to submit to this Court along with this application. At least no"
"attempt has been made by him to tender them to this Court even subsequently. This Court is of"
"the view that the said documents are very essential and they must be before this Court when this"
"Court goes into the merits of the application. Non-compliance of the requirement regarding the"
"tendering   of   such   documents   has   not   been   satisfactorily   explained   by   the   petitioner   and"
"therefore, this Court is of the view that there is a violation of the provisions of Rule 46, which is"
"fatal to this application.”"
"The   Petitioner   has   not   only   failed   to   answer   this   objection   but   has   also   failed   to   give   an"
"explanation for the non-compliance with the Court of Appeal rules."
"Necessary parties are not before Court"
"The learned Counsel for 6th,13th,9th, and 10th Respondents contended that there are several other"
"mining operators who are carrying out mining operations in the Goolsheneally Watte also known"
"as Neelawangala watte. This is amply established by the documents submitted by the Petitioner"
"himself, especially the copies of the records of the Court cases against some of these operators. It"
"was the contention of the Counsel that this is relevant, especially in view of the way the reliefs"
"are   prayed.  The   Petitioner  is  seeking   a  writ   of  certiorari  to   quash/annul,  cancel/suspend   the"
"approvals granted for carrying mining in the above-stated area. Thus, it was argued that the"
"orders sought would affect parties who are not before Court but are legally carrying out mining"
"operations in the area."
"It was also argued that the mining license issued, should be on a recommendation from the area"
"Grama Sevaka, The Divisional Secretary, The Pradeshiya Sabha, Department of Archeology, and"
"especially the Department of Geological Surveys and Mines Bureau who is the issuing authority"
"of the license and who has the obligation to supervise that the conditions of the license are"
"observed.   None   of   them   have   been   made   parties   to   this   action.   It   was   contended   that   the"
"Petitioner in paragraph 10 of his petition had reserved the right to amend the parties who are"
"illegally engaged in mining and add necessary parties upon the receipt of additional information."
"However, the Petitioner has failed to make any application to such effect and has not amended"
"the  petition  till  the arguments  were concluded.  This  objection  too  was  not  answered  by the"
"Petitioner. The Petitioner is seeking a writ of mandamus compelling the 1st  Respondent to act"
"under the provisions of the Mines and the Minerals Act but as correctly pointed out by the 1 st to"
"5th Respondents Counsel, the monitoring and supervisory duties are carried out under Act No 33"
"of 1992 by the Geological Surveys and Mines Bureau and its officers. We find the Petitioner has"
"failed to make the said Geological Surveys and Mines Bureau a party to this application."
