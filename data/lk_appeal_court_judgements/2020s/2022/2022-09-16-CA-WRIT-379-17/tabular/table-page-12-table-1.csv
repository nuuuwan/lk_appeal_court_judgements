"In Tilwin Silva v Ranil Wickremasinghe and Other (2007) 2 SLR 15 it was held that, “The"
"Petitioner’s prayer for a writ of prohibition not to sign any similar agreement is vague wide, and"
"doubtful and such relief cannot be granted.”"
"In his application for a writ of mandamus, the Petitioner has sought an order to compel the"
"Respondents to act pursuant to several sections of the respective acts. However, the Petitioner"
"has failed to address this Court as to what specific provisions of the Act have not been complied"
"with and/or whether the Respondents have refused to discharge the statutory duties cast on them."
"As held in the above case, when a Petitioner seeks relief under judicial review, he should be"
"specific and should know what relief he is seeking and against whom or against what illegal acts"
"the relief is prayed. Under the circumstances, we agree that the prayer is vague and the objection"
"succeeds."
"M
ispresenting  and  suppressing vital  facts  to Court, thus  has  failed  to come  with  clean"
"hands"
"The Petitioner has come to Court on the basis that there is environmental destruction caused by"
"illegal mining. His main allegation is against the 6th to 13th Respondents who are alleged to be"
"causing the destruction by their illegal acts. To demonstrate the violations of the conditions of"
"the permit, the Petitioner has attached the documents P4 and P5a-c. The Petitioner also submitted"
"in paragraph 9 the copies  of the  mining  license  given to 6th  to 13th  Respondents and in the"
"subsequent paragraph has stated that the area residents had made several complaints to the police"
"which resulted in a prosecution. To demonstrate this point, the Petitioner has tendered to Court"
"the documents marked as P10 and P11a-e, P12, P14, and P15."
"As   stated   elsewhere   in   this   Judgment,   this   Court   observes   that   the   said   documents   are   not"
"pertaining to the 6th to 13th Respondents. The way in which the above-mentioned documents were"
"pleaded was misleading to this Court and the failure of the Petitioner to disclose that the above"
"documents were not pertaining to the 6th – 13th Respondents amounts to a misrepresentation of"
"facts. Thus the Respondents’ contention that the Petitioner by misrepresentation has distorted the"
"actual situation to gain an undue advantage at their cost, has merit."
"In Namunukula Plantations Limited Vs Minister of Lands and others (2012) 1 SLR pg 376"
"it was interalia  held that  “It is settled  law that  a person approaches the Court for grant of"
"discretionary relief, to which category and application for a writ of certiorari would undoubtedly"
"belong, has to come with clean hands, and should candidly disclose all the material facts which"
"have any bearing on the adjudication of the issues raised in the case. In other words, he owes a"
"duty of utmost good faith (uberimafides) to the court to make a full and complete disclosure of"
"all   material   facts   and   refrain   from   concealing   or   suppressing   any   material   facts   within   his"
"knowledge   or   which   he   could   have   known   by   exercising   diligence   expected   of   a   person   of"
"ordinary prudence.”"
