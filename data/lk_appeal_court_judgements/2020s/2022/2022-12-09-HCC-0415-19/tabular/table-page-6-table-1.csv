"itself, 
even 
before 
the 
appellants  were 
arrested."
"Therefore, it is the contention of the learned DSG that"
"the  prosecution  has  proved  the  charges  against  both"
"the appellants beyond reasonable doubt."
"11.  The  PW1,  who  was 
faced  with  the 
full 
incident  of"
"robbery, has been consistent in his evidence. The PW1"
"has  had  ample  time 
for  being  acquainted  with  the"
"appellants  from  the  time  the  appellants  got  into  his"
"lorry.  Not  only  were  they  travelling  together,  but  they"
"have  also  had  tea  together  before  the  PW1  was  blind"
"folded by the appellants."
"12.  In  “Turnbull”  [1977]  QB  224  English  Court  of  Appeal"
"laid down important guidelines for the Judges on trials"
"that 
involve 
disputed 
identification 
evidence. 
The"
"purpose  of  those  guidelines  were  to  avoid  the  risk  of"
"injustice,  as  even  an  honest  witness  may  be  wrong  in"
"identifying  a  suspect  on  being  convinced  that  he  is"
"right.  The  Court  may  consider  the  length  of  time  for"
"which 
the  witness  could  observe 
the  accused, 
the"
"distance between the accused and the witness when he"
"saw  him, 
the  state  of 
the 
light  and  any  obstacles"
"between  the  accused  and  the  witness  to  obstruct  the"
"witness from seeing the accused."
"13.  As  I  have stated  before,  the  PW1  has  had ample  time,"
"good 
lighting 
conditions, 
and  has  been 
in 
close"
"proximity to see the appellants when he was travelling"
"and having tea with the appellants."
"14.  The  PW1  has  gone  to  the  Negombo  police  station  to"
"make  his  statement.  He  denied  seeing  the  appellants"
"at the Negombo police station. The appellants had been"
"kept  under  detention.  The  appellants  have  failed  to"
"inform 
the 
acting  Magistrate  who 
conducted 
the"
"identification  parade 
that, 
they  were  seen  by 
the"
"witnesses 
at 
the 
police 
station. 
In 
their 
dock"
"statements, 
both 
the 
appellants 
have 
said 
that,"
"although  they  informed  the  same  at  the  identification"
