"the 1st Party-Petitioner-Respondent had stated not to obstruct the said road and to have"
"the illegal construction removed, failing which, legal action would follow."
"I
t appears that the Pradeshiya Sabhawa had informed the Registrar of Court by letter dated"
"26.11.2009  [1ව3]  of  the  unlawful  steps  taken  by  the  1st  Party-Petitioner-Respondent."
"Furthermore,  Grama  Niladari’s  letter  dated  28.10.2009  [1ව5]  informed  the  Divisional"
"Secretary of the unlawful and illegal steps taken by the 1st Party-Petitioner-Respondent in"
"obstructing  the  roadway  and  the  letter  dated  18.11.2009  [X5]  from  the  Grama  Sevaka"
"emphatically points out that this road has been in existence for over 20 years and money"
"has been allocated to repair the road."
"T
he letters X5A and X6 and the fact that money has also been released for the maintenance"
"or repair [X7A] show that this roadway is maintained by the  Pradeshiya Sabhawa for the"
"public as it is a public road. It was argued that this is the reason for the Primary Court to"
"state that non-use of a public road would not entitle another to claim a right over the road."
"I
n this instance, it was submitted that the Order of the Primary Court is a provisional Order,"
"and if any dispute exists over civil rights, one must resort to a civil action. The Primary"
"Court was of the view that as there is a breach of peace and as the road has been classified"
"as a public road and as a road maintained by the Pradeshiya Sabhawa, the Respondents are"
"entitled to use the roadway and to have the right granted until the matter is finally decided"
"by a civil Court with competent jurisdiction."
"I
t appears that a large number of villagers were using this roadway. Moreover, the question"
"of abandonment would not arise as the matter was pending before the Mediation Board."
"For abandonment to arise, it should be a complete waiver with the intent to give the right"
"of  way  but  the  fact  that  it  was  before  the  Mediation  Board  shows  that  there  was  no"
"abandonment of the right. Thus, the 2nd Party-Respondent-Appellant as well as the other"
"Intervenients are entitled to use the roadway."
"T
he  difference  between  ‘abandonment’  and  ‘non  user’  was  argued  on  behalf  of  the"
"Appellant.  It  was  submitted  that  abandonment  bears  the  ingredient  of  “intention”  and"
"where ‘non-user’ is concerned, it does not bear the “intention”. The learned High Court"
