"Hence, the primary contention to be decided by this Court is whether the",""
"learned Magistrate has correctly evaluated the evidence placed before him",""
"when  arriving  at  the  final  determination  that  the  appellant has  failed  to",""
"dispense  the  said  burden.  It  was  contended  by  the  appellant  that  the",""
"vehicle  had  been  used  to  transport  rocks  from  a  quarry  and  the  driver",""
"(accused) picked up the vehicle when required and handed over at around",""
"8.00/9.00  p.m.  usually.  He","further  contented  that  he  employed  the"
"accused as the driver of the vehicle as he was known to him from his own",""
"village,  and  the  driver  himself  had  previously  owned  and  driven  a  lorry.",""
"The driver has requested the appellant to employ him as he had sold his",""
"own vehicle. He further contended that the driver had not engaged in any",""
"illegal activities with his own vehicle.  He states that on the day in question,",""
"driver  had  taken  the  vehicle  to  the  quarry  and  had  not  returned.  The",""
"appellant had gone searching for the vehicle and the quarry had informed",""
"him  that  the  driver  had  gone  to  transport  a  load  of  rocks.  Then  the",""
"appellant had called the driver on his mobile phone which had not worked.",""
"He contends that upon being informed about the incident he inquired the",""
"driver as to why he committed such an act when he is informed otherwise,",""
"following which he has dismissed the driver from his employment. During",""
"examination in chief, the appellant has given evidence as to the manner in",""
"which  he  dispensed","the  burden  cast  upon  him  under 
the  Forest"
"Ordinance, i.e., that he had given all instructions and taken all necessary",""
"precautions to prevent the commission of a forest offence.",""
"When  perusing  the  evidence  given  by  the  appellant,  it  is  noted  that  the",""
"prosecution  has  not  properly  cross-examined  and/or  contradicted  or",""
"challenged  the  precautionary  measures  he  has  claimed  to  have  taken.",""
"Therefore,  all  such  measures  he  has  contended  remain  admissible  as",""
"evidence. At this point it is pertinent to quote His Lordship Justice Salam",""
