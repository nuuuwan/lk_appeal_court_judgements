"(2)","Where an employer makes default in the payment of any sum which he is liable to pay"
"","under  subsection  (1),  and  the  commissioner  is  of  the  opinion  that  it  is  impracticable  or"
"","inexpedient to recover that sum under any other provisions of this ordinance, then, he may"
"","issue a certificate containing particulars of the sum so due and the name and place of the"
"","defaulting  employer  to  the  Magistrate  having  jurisdiction  in  the  division in  which  such"
"","place is  situated. The Magistrate shall thereupon  summon such employer before him to"
"","show cause why further proceedings for the recovery of the sum due should not be taken"
"","against him, and in default of sufficient cause being shown, such sum shall be deemed to"
"","be a fine imposed on such employer by such Magistrate and shall be recovered accordingly."
