"The two cases filed by the 11th Defendant-Appellant were filed in 1975 and 1978. Even though the"
"11th Defendant-Appellant had got judgment in his favour, he had not succeeded in exercising the"
"judicial mechanism to oust the Plaintiff or 1st to 10th Defendant-Respondents."
"I
f he was keen, he could have exercised his rights, prayed for relief from a court or filed contempt"
"papers against the party who objected to carrying out the court orders. This clearly indicates that"
"the 11th Defendant slept on his rights if he had any."
"T
he present case was filed in 1995. The Appellant had not taken steps within one year and a day"
"from the date of judgment in the cases mentioned above. Therefore, the judgment in those cases"
"gets abated. As the Learned District Judge points out, from 1978 to 1995, there were nearly 20"
"years."
"T
he Deeds marked as ""11V (10)"" and ""11V (11)"" were Deeds written in 1957 and 1971. Again,"
"the question arises what had the 11th Defendant-Appellant done When he had deeds and judgments"
"in his favour, he had been sleeping on his rights."
"T
he 11th Defendant-Appellant, in his evidence, had admitted that Kuranage Joseph Fernando was"
"in occupation of the land in the 1970s. He admitted that from the 1940s, said father of the Plaintiff"
"and the 1st to 9th Defendants had lived in the premises."
"A
 case filed in 1985 in the primary court of Wennapuwa, marked as ""P16"", was discussed by the"
"learned District Judge, and in Appeal, it was marked as ""11V (14)"". In the primary court, the order"
"was  against  the  Appellant.  His  Appeal  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  failed  due  to  a  technical  error"
"resulting in the primary court order being affirmed. When the order is in favour, the prescription"
"does not suffer."
"T
he Appellant had not paid enough vigilance to his case at the District Court. He had not taken"
"steps to safeguard his rights when the judgment of the case filed in the 1970s was in his favour."
