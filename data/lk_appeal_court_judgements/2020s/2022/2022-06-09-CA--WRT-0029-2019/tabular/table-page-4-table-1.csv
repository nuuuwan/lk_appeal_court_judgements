"according to the provisions of paragraph (b) of subsection (1), or of the death of such"
"spouse as the case may be.”"
"The Petitioner admits that she was dispossessed by her mother and the 5th Respondent"
"from the land. Thereafter, in 1997, a Grant has been issued to the mother for her life"
"interest. Admittedly the mother died on 18.12.2017 (death certificate is marked as P-"
"25).  The  Petitioner  made  a  formal  request  on  08.01.2018  to  the  1st  Respondent  in"
"prescribed Form (marked as P-23) used at the Office of the 1st Respondent to succeed"
"to the land and the 1st – 4th Respondents admit in their statement of objections that the"
"letter marked as P-23 was received by the 1st Respondent. After the death of the mother,"
"the  Petitioner  made  attempts  to  recover  the  possession  of  the  land  from  the  5th"
"Respondent, but failed those attempts. Upon the failure of those attempts the Petitioner"
"made a complaint to the Medagama Police Station and by the letter dated 14.03.2018,"
"the OIC of the Police referred the dispute to the 1st Respondent to take suitable steps."
"The 1st –  4th Respondents  admit  that Medagama Police referred the  matter to  the 1st"
"Respondent.  The  Petitioner  wrote  to  the  District  Secretary  of  Monaragala  (the  2nd"
"Respondent)  about  the  dispute  and  the  2nd  Respondent  by  letter  dated  02.04.2018"
"(marked as P-28) referred the matter to the 1st Respondent to inquire into to. By the"
"letter dated 05.07.2018 (marked as P-29) the 1st Respondent summoned the parties for"
"an  inquiry.  The  letters  marked  as  P-24  and  P-29  were  admitted  by  the  1st  –  4th"
"Respondents. When perusing the documents marked as P-25 to P-28 it is clear that the"
"Petitioner has taken all possible steps to succeed to the land, but failed to enter into the"
"possession of the land due to the resistance of the 5th Respondent. Therefore, the Court"
"cannot accept the position of the 5th Respondent that the Petitioner has failed to succeed"
"to  the  land  within  a  period  of  6  months  from  the  date  of  the  death  of  the  mother,"
"Nonnehamy. Under the above stated circumstances, the Court decided to issue a writ"
"of  Mandamus  directing  the  1st  –  4th  Respondents  to  issue  a  Permit/Grant  under  the"
"Ordinance to the Petitioner to the land in dispute, and a writ of Prohibition probating"
"the 1st – 4th Respondents from issuing a Permit/Grant to the 5th Respondent for the said"
