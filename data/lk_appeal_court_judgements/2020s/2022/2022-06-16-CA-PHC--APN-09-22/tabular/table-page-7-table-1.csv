"The said Chaminda and his mother had been threatened over the phone and the said"
"calls are being investigated."
"Hence the Attorney General objected for bail being granted to the petitioner and"
"averred that there is no illegality in the order of the learned High Court Judge."
"The petitioner alleged that there is an inordinate delay in the proceedings against"
"the petitioner and the petitioner had been falsely implicated by the complainant."
"In the order of the High Court the learned High Court Judge he had considered the"
"fact  that  since  the  investigations  are  yet  to  be  concluded,  granting  bail  to  the"
"petitioner might not do justice to all parties and he had referred to section 14(a) (ii)"
"of the Bail Act nu 30 1997 which says as”interfere with the witnesses or the evidence"
"against him or otherwise obstruct the course of justice”."
"Upon perusal of submissions of all parties it is quite clear that the complaint of the"
"intervenient complaint is belated but the facts pertaining to the complaint needs to"
"be investigated and the facts so far revealed upon the latest investigations are very"
"clear  that further investigation is very  much needed.  As such belatedness of the"
"complaint can be gone in to at trial stage."
"Therefore it is the opinion of this Court that upon the material so far revealed the"
"instant  matter  is  not  yet  fully  investigated  and  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  in"
"concluding that in order for justice to be dispensed to all parties that granting of bail"
"can hamper the investigations is not illegal nor shocks the conscious of this Court in"
"order to invoke the revisionary powers of this Court."
"It is a well-established principle of law that when a party files a revision application"
"the  party  filling  the  same  must  that  demonstrate  that  there  are  illegalities  in  the"
"impugned order which shocks the conscious of this Court."
