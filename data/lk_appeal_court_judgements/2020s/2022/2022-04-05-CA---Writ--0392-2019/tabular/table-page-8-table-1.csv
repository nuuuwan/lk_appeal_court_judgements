"cause  being  shown,  the  sum  in  default  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  fine  imposed  by  a"
"sentence of the Magistrate on such defaulter for an offence punishable with fine only"
"or not punishable with imprisonment and the provisions of subsection (1) of section 291"
"(except paragraph (a), (d) and (i) thereof) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No."

"of the 3rd Respondent under Section 13 of the said Act is a nullity.”"

"dated 15.06.2014 marked P-4. That letter has been accepted by the Company. Section"
