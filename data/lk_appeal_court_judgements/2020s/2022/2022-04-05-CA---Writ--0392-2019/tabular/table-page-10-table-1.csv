"considering all the above stated facts and circumstances, the Court can conclude that"
"the decision said to have been taken in terms of section 13 of the Gratuity Act by the"
"Company, is illegal and ultra vires."
"The learned Counsel appearing for the Company argued that the Company has never"
"been  heard  by  the  Commissioner  of  Labour  regarding  the  application  of  the  4th"
"Respondent for payment of gratuity and therefore, no- proper inquiry has been held. By"
"the  letter  dated  15.12.2014  marked  P-16  (a),  the  1st  Respondent  has  informed  the"
"Company that he is conducting an inquiry on 29.11.2014 in respect of the complaint"
"made by the 4th Respondent and adduce evidence if any at the inquiry. After the inquiry"
"was held, the 1st Respondent by letter dated 07.05.2015 marked P-17 has informed the"
"Company to deposit Rs. 1,214,500/- (gratuity and the penalty thereto) to be paid to the"
"4th Respondent. The Company, by letter dated 14.05.2015 marked P-18 has requested"
"from  the  1st  Respondent  to  reconsider  the  decision  contained  in  P-17.  In  P-18  the"
"Company has admitted that at the inquiry held before the 1st Respondent, an opportunity"
"had been given to the Company to present its facts and accordingly, on behalf of the"
"Company the facts had been presented. Therefore, it is clear that the submission of the"
"learned Counsel for the Company that the Company was never heard is incorrect. It is"
"evident from the letter marked P-19 that the 1st Respondent had taken steps to conduct"
"another inquiry in pursuant to a request made on behalf of the Company on P-18. By"
"P-19 the Company had been informed by the 1st Respondent to present all evidence at"
"the  inquiry  and  after  a  fresh  inquiry  was  held,  the  1st  Respondent  has  informed  the"
"Company  by  letter  dated  29.03.2017  marked  P-20  that  it  is  liable  to  pay  the  sum"
"mentioned  in  P-17.  Responding  to  that  letter,  the  Company  has  sent  the  letter  dated"
"11.04.2017 marked P-21 to the 1st Respondent retreating the facts stated in its earlier"
"letter marked P-18 that the Company is not liable to pay gratuity to the 4th Respondent"
