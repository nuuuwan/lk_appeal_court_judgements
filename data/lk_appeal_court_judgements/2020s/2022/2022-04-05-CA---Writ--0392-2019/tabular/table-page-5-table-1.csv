"superseded by the Order of the learned Magistrate and since the Provincial High Court"
"has  affirmed  the  Order  of  the  learned  Magistrate,  now  that  Order  is  in  operation."
"Therefore, the position of the learned SSC is that the Company is not entitled to raise"
"the jurisdictional objection belatedly in this writ application."
"The position of the learned Counsel for the 4th Respondent is that the Company, without"
"challenging the decisions of the Commissioner of Labour containing in the document"
"marked P-17 and the letter marked P-20 sent by the 1st Respondent to the Company"
"confirming  the  decision  mentioned  in  P-17,  the  Company  wrongfully  challenge  the"
"Certificate issued by the 2nd Respondent marked P-23. Therefore, the learned Counsel"
"argued  that  even  if  the  Court  quash  the  decision  in  the  document  marked  P-23,  the"
"determinations of the 1st Respondent on P-17 and P-20 will be in force and in that sense"
"the action of the Company will be futile."
"In  this  writ  application,  the  Company  challenge  the  Certificate  issued  by  the  2nd"
"Respondent dated 31.03.2018 marked P-23 on the basis that the 2nd Respondent has no"
"jurisdiction to consider the decision of the Company for forfeiting the gratuity of the"
"4th Respondent and that power is vested with the labour tribunal. In addition to that,"
"before  taking  the  decision  that  the  Company  is  liable  to  pay  the  gratuity  to  the  4th"
"Respondent, the Company was not heard and therefore, no proper inquiry has been held"
"by the 2nd Respondent."
"The section 13 of the Gratuity Act provides thus;"
"â€œAny  workman  to  whom  a  gratuity  is  payable  under  Part  II  of  this  Act  and  whose"
"services have been terminated for reasons of fraud, misappropriation of funds of the"
"employer,  willful damage to  property of  the employer, or causing the loss of  goods,"
