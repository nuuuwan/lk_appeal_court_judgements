"Defendant to postpone the case."
"The Defendant filed a leave to appeal application against the said Order of"
"the District Judge’s refusal to give a date on the basis that this has caused him"
"grave  prejudice  as  he  was  of  ill  health.  It  was  argued  that  the  learned  District"
"Judge ought to have granted a date for him to lead evidence in compliance with"
"the  ‘Audi  Alteram  Partem’  principle  encapsulated  in  the  principles  of  natural"
"justice. In the leave to appeal application filed in the Civil Appellate High Court"
"of  the  Northern  Province  holden  at  Jaffna,  the  Defendant  prayed  for  a  stay  of"
"further proceedings in the District Court pending the determination of the leave"
"to appeal application. In the meantime, the learned District Judge held in favour"
"of the Plaintiff and delivered the judgment on 20.02.2019, ejecting the Defendant."

"Court  on  20.02.2020,  after  a  lapse  of  one  year  from  the  date  of  the  judgment."
"According  to  the  journal  entries,  a  number  of  dates  were  given  because  of  the"
"Covid-19 lockdowns. After serving notice, Counsel for the Defendant appeared on"
"17.06.2020  and  moved  for  a  date  to  file  objections  and  the  Court  granted  that"
"request. The case was fixed for 15.09.2020.  As per the Petition and the journal"
"entries, the said Attorney was instructed to move for a further date for objections"
"as  the  Defendant  was  unable  to  return  to  the  island  to  hand  over  pertinent"
"documents since the Sri Lankan airports continued to remain closed, due to the"
"Covid-19 lockdowns."
