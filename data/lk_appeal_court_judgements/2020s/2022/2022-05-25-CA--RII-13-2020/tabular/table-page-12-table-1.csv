"We are of the view that the conduct of the Defendant, in seeking to deprive"
"the Plaintiff of the fruits of her successful litigation, is resorting to conduct that"
"constitutes an abuse of the process of the Court."
"In  the  words  of  Justice  Bhagwati  (as  he  then  was)  in  Bandhua  Mukti"
"Morcha v. Union of India 1984 AIR 802 “the Court must be ever vigilant against"
"the abuse of its process.” The Court does not do justice to the other parties to the"
"proceedings in question if it allows its process to be abused."
"Therefore, we dismiss the application with costs."
