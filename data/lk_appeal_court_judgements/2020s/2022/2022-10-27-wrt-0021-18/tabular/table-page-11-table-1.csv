"relation  to planning  and development  within such protection  area is  vested with the Central"
"Environmental Authority. There was no material placed before this Court to demonstrate, that"
"the Authority had ceased to be the authority responsible for the planning and protection of the"
"zone."
"Thus, the Petitionerâ€™s construction does not fall within schedule II of the Regulations published"
"in the Gazette marked A4. Hence, the construction of a house within the protected area does not"
"fall within the permitted usage."
"Schedule  III  of the said Gazette,  subjects  even the  permitted  uses  under strict conditions. It"
"stipulates that approvals that have to be obtained prior to the commencement of any construction."
"In our view, since the construction of a house does not fall within the permitted uses, obtaining"
"the approvals of the relevant authorities will not rise, as, in our view, the approvals contemplated"
"under schedule III are applicable only to the permitted uses."
"In the absence of any material submitted to this Court pertaining to the power of delegation, by"
"the Central Environmental Authority, it is safe to come to the conclusion that the planning and"
"development within the protected zone are vested with the 1st Respondent."
"The learned Counsel for the Petitioners contended that in or around 2016, the 1st Petitioner had"
"been   informed   by   the   2nd  Petitioner   about   the   commencement   of   construction   within   the"
"protected area by the 5th Respondent. The said development plan was tendered to this Court (A6)."
"It   was   also   submitted   that   prior   to   the   1st  Petitioner   being   informed,   the   2nd  Petitioner   had"
"informed various authorities pertaining to the attempts of construction (A7, A8). As a result of"
"this, the 3rd  Respondent after a site inspection directed the 5th  Respondent to stop the alleged"
"illegal activities (A9). It is also observed that as per A9, at the time the site inspection was"
"carried   out,   the   construction   had   been   at   the   commencement   stage,   that   is,   laying   of   the"
"foundation."
"However, it is submitted by the Petitioners, that instead of halting the construction subsequent to"
"A9, the construction had gathered speed and the 1st Petitioner had been compelled to bring this to"
"the attention of the 3rd Respondent (A10). Subsequently, as there had been no progress, the 3rd"
"Petitioner by letter dated 10.8.2016 (A11) had once again informed the 1st Petitioner."
