"The Learned High Court Judge has not directed the sentences to run concurrently. Therefore,"
"it  could  be  considered  to  run  consecutively.  The  accused-appellant  preferred  this  appeal"
"against the said conviction and sentence."
"When this appeal was taken up for argument the learned counsel for the accused-appellant informs"
"court that his client is not challenging the conviction. The accused-appellants is challenging only the"
"sentence."
"The learned counsel who appeared for the accused-appellant informed the court that he is 63 years"
"of age and was not having any previous convictions. He is a father of 2 children. Therefore, requested"
"from the court to impose 10 years of rigorous imprisonment on each count to run concurrently."
"I
t  was  decided  in  MOHD.  Akhtar  Hussain  Alias  Ibrahim  Ahmed  Bhatti  Vs.  Assistant  Collector  of"
"Customs (Prevention) Ahmedabad & ORS (date of judgment 31.08.1988) 1988 AIR 2143, 1988 SCC"
"(4) 183, 1988 SCALE (2)552, 1988 SCR Supl. (2) 747 and JT 1988 (3) 586, as follows;"
"HELD: 1. Section 427, Cr. P.C. relates to the administration of criminal justice and provides the"
"procedure for sentencing. The basic rule of thumb over the years has been the so-called single"
"transaction  rule  for  concurrent  sentences.  If  a  given  transaction  constitutes  two  offences"
"under two enactments generally, it is wrong to have consecutive sentences.  It is proper and"
"legitimate to have concurrent sentences. But this rule has no application if the transaction"
"relating  to  offences  are  not  the  same  or  the  facts  constituting  the  two  offences  are  quite"
"different."
"I
n the present case, the three offences were committed under the same transaction and therefore"
"the accused-appellant should be given 10 years rigorous imprisonment to run concurrently."
"The learned SSC appearing on behalf of the respondent informs the court that he has no objections"
"to  the  application  of  the  accused-appellant,  to  impose  10  years  of  rigorous  imprisonment  to  run"
"concurrently."
"Considering the circumstances of the case we decide to impose 10 years rigorous imprisonment for"
"each count to run concurrently with effect from 08.11.2018. The rest of the sentence will remain the"
"same."
"The registrar of this court is being directed to inform the prison authorities about this judgement and"
"the  original  case  record  should  be  sent  to  the  High  Court  of  Chilaw  along  with  a  copy  of  this"
"judgement forthwith."
