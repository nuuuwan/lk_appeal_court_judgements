"Para 10 of the Petitioners’ affidavit states as follows;"
"“I state that for approximately more than 13 years I continued my business without any objection"
"from the people of Dutuwewa area and especially the religious community of the area”. At the"
"argument, it was submitted that till she received the letter on 10th January 2012 (P5) there was no"
"public protest against her business."
"In view of the documents R1, R2 & R3 this is a serious misrepresentation and suppression of"
"facts by the Petitioner. The Petitioner’s main contention before this Court is that she had been"
"asked   to   shift   her   premises   of   business   without   any   public   protest   but   at   the   behest   of   the"
"Divisional Secretary Galenbindunuwewa. For the reasons best known to the Petitioner, she had"
"suppressed a material fact, that there had been objections by the public against her beer shop and"
"that there have been demonstrations as reflected in R3. The Petitioner has failed to submit that"
"she had participated in the inquiry and also there had been decisions taken. In our view, this is a"

"before asking to shift the premises fails, in view of non-disclosed facts namely the existence of"
"documents R1, R2, R3, and R11. Thus, in view of these documents, this Court agrees with the"

"suppress   any   relevant   facts   from   Court.   He   must   refrain   from   making   any   misleading"
"statements to Court”. The importance of coming to court with clean hands was recently stressed"
"in Orient Pearl Hotels vs Cey Nor-Foundation Limited & others CA Writ 226/2018 decided"
"on 02.08.2021 where it was held “It is settled law that a party seeking prerogative relief should"
"come to court with clean hands. The expression is derived from one of equity’s maxims – He"
"who comes to Equity must come with clean hands.”"
"In our judicial history, there are a plethora of judgments stating from Alphonsu Appuhami Vs."
"Hettiarachchi 77 NLR 131, Dahanayaka and others vs. Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation"
