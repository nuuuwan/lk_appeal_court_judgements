"In the case of Darley, Butler & Co v. Saheed NLR vol 12 pg 367 “Waiver, like acquiescence,"
"pre-supposes that the person sought to be bound is fully cognizant of the facts when he does"
"the act by which he is to be affected.”"
"It was the contention of the Respondents that as the public protest was gathering momentum, for"
"the preservation of peace, in agreement with all parties, the 1st Respondent had instructed the 7th"
"Respondent to allow the existing license given to the Petitioner to be allowed to be used only till"
"31.07.14 in the current premises and thereafter to close the said liquor store. Respondents further"
"contended  that the said letter  had been issued to preserve the peace  with the  consent  of all"
"stakeholders   as   agreed  at  the  inquiry   held  on 02.07.14  (P8A).  The  Divisional  Secretary   has"
"communicated this instruction he received to the Petitioner by the letter dated 21.07.14 (P8B)."
"As the suspension of the business had taken effect, the Petitioner on 2014. 10.30 had submitted a"
"fresh   application   to   obtain   a   new   license   (P10A).   It   is   pertinent   to   note   that   in   the   said"
"application, there is an entry that states, the Petitioner had voluntarily closed her business due to"
"a public protest and until it is shifted to another location."
"The learned Counsel for the Respondents also brought to the attention of this Court, that as this is"
"an annual license, the Petitioner’s license which was suspended in 2015, is now expired as per"
"the Regulations. As per the submissions we observe, that the Petitioner’s existing license anyway"
"has expired and if the Petitioner wishes to obtain a license she will have to apply for a new"
"license."
"Suppression of Facts"
"At this stage, this Court will consider the objection raised on suppression of material fact and"
"misrepresentation."
"The Petitioner has failed to disclose to this Court, the existence of objections and the protest that"
"had taken place in the year 2011 until the Respondents submitted the same with documentary"
"evidence through their objections. In fact, the Petitioner’s main contention was that they had"
"carried on with this business till the year 2014 without any disturbance."
