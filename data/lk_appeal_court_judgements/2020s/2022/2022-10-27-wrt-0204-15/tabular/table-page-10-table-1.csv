"All these documents clearly establish that the Petitioner not only has acquiesced with the original"
"decision to relocate but had subsequently on her own made an application to shift her business"
"and   relocate   it   to   a   suitable   location.   This   is   a   clear   contradiction   to   the   arguments   made,"
"whereby it was submitted that the Petitioner had been forced to relocate her premises without"
"giving her a hearing. In this instance, this Court finds that the Petitioner has after acquiescing the"
"decision to shift and subsequently giving an undertaking on her own to shift the premises, sought"
"to challenge the same decision she had agreed upon."
"This Court also observes that the Petitioner had not submitted any material to demonstrate that"
"she had taken part in the inquiry under protest. The Petitioner has also not explained to the"
"satisfaction of this Court, as to her own undertaking to shift the premises to which the license"
"was issued. In the absence of such, this Court holds that Respondentsâ€™ objection on acquiescence"
"succeeds."
