"The   Petitioners   in   their   submission   contended   that   a   minimum   wage   of   Rs.1000   will"
"adversely   affect   the   entire   plantation   sector.   All   parties   agreed   that   the   majority   of   the"
"workers serve in small holdings and one of the contentions of the Petitioners opposing the"
"said   increment   was   that   if   the   minimum   wage   is   increased   to   1000   per   day   the   said"
"smallholders would be adversely affected. However, it is observed that none of the small"
"holdings or their representatives are made a party to this application. It was also argued that"
"the   impugned   decision   of   the   Board   will   have   a   serious   bearing   on   the   entire   tea"
"manufacturing industry.  The said decision definitely will have a bearing on the huge number"
"of plantation workers and the Petitioners have failed to name at least the representatives of"
"the plantation workers or the plantation workers. They further submitted referring to 1R1,"
"1R2, 1R3, and 1R4 that there is an estimated workforce of 640,000 estate workers out of"
"which only about 20% of the workforce are working in the plantation sector while the rest are"
"attached to small holdings. Thus, the contention of the Respondents is that the Petitioners"
"have failed to add all necessary parties to this application."
"Responding to the said contention, the Petitioners submitted that they were only challenging"
"the decision of the Minister which is marked as P12 thus, the only necessary party should be"
"the Minister. At the same time, the Petitioners submit that the Chairman of the Wages Board,"
"the workers’ representatives  on the Board, and all the Minister’s nominees to the Wages"
"Board are made Respondents. The Petitioners’ contention is that since the Petitioners’ own"
"agents or representatives were the employers’ representatives at the Wages Board, therefore it"
"need not name the Petitioners’ own agents and the representatives as Respondents. Further,"
"the Petitioners’ representatives have voted against the Wages Board proposal to increase the"
"minimum   salary,   and   therefore   they   were   not   prejudiced   by   the   reliefs   sought   by   the"
"Petitioners. The Petitioners further argue that the plantation companies who did not challenge"
"the Wages Board decision (P12) need not be made parties as by their conduct they were not"
"adversely affected by the impugned decision and accordingly, the two regional plantation"
"companies who have not challenged the Wages Board decision had not been dragged into this"
"case."
"The 15th to 17th Respondents further submitted that not only the employers’ representatives of"
"the   Wages   Board   of   tea   and   rubber   have   been   omitted   from   this   application,   but   the"
"Petitioners have also failed to name the estate workers’ representatives or the estate workers,"
"and further the two regional plantation companies namely, Agalawatta Plantation PLC and"
"Pussellawa Plantation PLC in this application."
"The Petitioners’ own conduct adversely affects their submissions as to the necessary parties."
"As   contended,   if   the   Petitioners   thought   that   they   were   challenging   only   the   Minister’s"
"decision   and   only   the   Minister   was   necessary   for   the   adjudication   of   this   application,"
"particularly the reasons for adding the employee representatives of the Wages Board and its"
"Chairman as Respondents were not given. In my view, the Petitioner has failed to add the"
"representatives of the employers as parties to this case. I will now examine whether the said"
"members are necessary and if the omission to add them was deliberate, hence, fatal to this"
"application."
