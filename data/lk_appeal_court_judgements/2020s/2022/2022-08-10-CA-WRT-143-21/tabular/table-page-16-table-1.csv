"get their minimum salaries increased up to 1000 has a considerable history. The trade union"
"has been agitating for the said increase since the year 2015 which is evident by the documents"
"marked (5R5). Hence, it’s clear that the agitation for the minimum wage hike of Rs.1000 was"
"a   continuous   contention   of   workers   long   before   the   presidential   elections   were   held.   It"
"appears that there had been several discussions between the employers and the employees on"
"this demand for a wage hike and in the absence of an agreement, a wages board had been"
"appointed to consider the employees’ demands. As there had been no agreement even by the"
"Wages Board as required by statute, the proposal to increase the minimum wage had been put"
"to vote. The proposed decision taken subsequent to a vote becomes the majority decision of"
"the Board. Hence the Petitioners’ contention that in view of P5 and P6, the Minister was"
"acting on a preordained path to increase the minimum wages to Rs 1000 has to fail. As per"
"the documents  available,  what is demonstrated  is  that, the workers’ agitations  have been"
"picked up by the contesting candidates who had endorsed the said demands. The Petitioners"
"have failed to disclose these facts."
"I  will  now  consider  the  minutes   of the  Wages  Board  for the  tea   industry  of 01.03.2021"
"submitted   to   this   Court   by   the   Respondents   marked   as   3R9.   As   per   this   document,   the"
"previous Wages Board proceedings which deliberated on the proposed minimum wage, have"
"been   proposed   and   confirmed   as   true.
  The   proceedings   have   been   confirmed   by"
"representatives of the employer and further, the representatives of the employer had proposed"
"an   amendment   to   the   minutes   (2R2).   The   said   proceedings   are   dated   01.03.2001.   The"
"Petitioners filed the instant petition on 10.03.2021. Thus, as per the minutes of the Wages"
"Board which was held on 01.03.2021, it is reasonable to come to the conclusion that the"
"employers’ representatives were in possession of the previous day’s proceedings for him to"
"propose an amendment to the minutes and to confirm the same as accurate. These were the"
"minutes of the Wages Board meeting where the proposal for minimum wage increment was"
"approved. Therefore, the act of not annexing the said authenticated Wages Board minutes for"
"the rubber industry and for the tea industry, especially in the above-mentioned circumstances,"
"and the subsequent failure to explain the reasons for not submitting the same to court, in my"
"view amounts to the Petitioners suppressing material facts pertaining to the Wages Board"
"meeting that took place on 08.02.2021. Accordingly, I am of the view that the Respondents’"
"objection pertaining to misrepresentation of facts, suppression of material facts and lack of"
"uberima fides has to succeed."
