"Thus, in my view, the employer’s representatives of the Wages Board are a necessary party to"
"this application."
"This Court also observes that despite the Petitioner contending that there was no necessity for"
"them to make their own representatives who were members of the Wages Board parties the"
"said members of the Wages Board sought to intervene in this application by a petition dated"
"04/05/2021.   The said application however was not pursued as the Respondents sought to"
"object to the intervention. The Respondents contended that such an attempt has been made"
"subsequent to the Respondents raising the objections of necessary parties and also submitted"
"to   the   Court   that   the   registered   attorney   who   filed   the   petition   for   intervention   by   the"
"employer’s representative at the Wages Board had the same address as the registered attorney"
"for   the   Petitioner.   The   Respondents   argued   that   this   attempt   for   intervention   clearly"
"demonstrates   that   the   necessary   parties   are   not   before   Court   and   the   Petitioners   have"
"attempted to overcome their failure to add necessary parties."
"Keeping   the   said   contention   as   it   may,   this   Court   will   now   consider   the   Petitioners’"
"contention that they need not make the members of the Wages Board parties as the impugned"
"decision P12 is approved by the Minister thus, the Minister is the only necessary party since"
"what is impugned is the Minster’s decision reflected in P12. I am unable to agree with the"
"said submissions. Section 29 of the Wages Board ordinance deals with the approval of the"
"Minister.  However, before the said decision is conveyed to the Minister under section 28, the"
"Wages Board has to publish their proposed decision in the gazette and call for objections."
"Once the proposed decision is published under section 28, and the Wages Board considers"
"and determines the objections raised against the proposed decision, only then does the Wages"
"Board transmit the confirmed decision to the Minister. As per the provisions of section 29, it"
"is this confirmed decision when received, the Minister would give his approval and publish it"
"in   the   government   gazette   or   the   Minster   would   refer   it   back   to   the   Wages   Board   for"
"reconsideration. When one looks at the wording of sections 28 and 29 of the Wages Board"
"Ordinance, it is clear that the decision is made by the Wages Board, and not by the Minister."
"The plain reading of section 28 is clear, the word used is the “proposed decision of the Wages"
"Board” until the objections are called and deliberated by the Board. Therefore, the wording"
"used under section 29 is quite clear, what is transmitted to the Minister for his approval is the"
"confirmed decision of the Board."
"The said Section 29 (1) reads as follows;"
"(1) every decision made by a wages Board and confirmed under section 28 shall-"
