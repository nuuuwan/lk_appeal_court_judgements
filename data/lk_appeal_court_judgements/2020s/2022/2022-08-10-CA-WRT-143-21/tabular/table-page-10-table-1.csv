"As   per   the   submissions   on   behalf   of  the   Petitioners,   it   is   clear   that   the   Petitioners   have"
"deliberately not added the parties whom the Respondents contend are necessary parties. In"
"view   of   the   said   submission,   I   am   of   the   view   that   the   non-addition   of   the   parties   is"
"intentional and the Petitioners have deliberately decided to omit them. Based on the above"
"grounds, I find that the Petitioners in this application are challenging the decisions of the"
"Wages Board. Whether the employers’ representatives who are members of the Wages Board"
"who decided in favor of the minimum wage increment or opposed to it, the final decision,"
"which is the outcome of the Wages Board is considered as the decision of the Wages Board."
"In view of the Wages Board Ordinance, the short title of the Ordinance pertaining to sections"
"28 and 29 clearly demonstrates what the legislature has meant is the decision of the Wages"
"Board.   Therefore, when the said decision is being challenged, it will eventually affect the"
"entire membership of the Wages Board. The decision of the Wages Board is considered the"
"collective decision (though in this instance by majority vote) of the Wages Board."
"In Benette Bandara and Others Vs. Uva Province Provincial Public Service Commission"
"and others CA/PHC/182/2012 decided on 05/14/2018 it was held “if it is a body of persons"
"whose   decision   or   exercise   of   power   is   sought   to   be   quashed   each   of   the   person’s"
"constituting such body who took part in taking impugned decision or the exercise of power"
"should   be   made   respondents,   the   failure   to   make   him   or   them   Respondents   to   the"
"application is fatal and provides in itself for the ground of  dismissal of the application in"
"limine ”"
"As   per   the   composition   of   the   Wages   Board,   the   said   Board   is   not   a   corporate   entity."
"Therefore, all the members who were involved in the decision-making of the instant Wages"
"Board should have been made a party, irrespective of whether they had supported the said"
"decision or not. As I have mentioned above, the Petitioners are challenging the Wages Board"
"decision perse which has been approved by the Minister."
"In  Dr. Gamini Gunathilaka and others vs UOC and others 2006 1 SLR 350  where the"
"selection of a Professor of Surgery by the University Council was challenged, the Court held"
"“in   these   circumstances,   the   Court   holds   the   members   of   the   University   Council   are"
"necessary  parties  to   this   application  and  as  the   Petitioner  has   failed   to  make   them  as"
"Respondents is a fatal irregularity and hence Court upholds the preliminary objections…”"
"In Wijerathne Commissioner of Motor Traffic vs Ven Dr Haragoda Vimalavansa Thero"
"and others (2011) 2SLR 258 it was held that ‘the 1st rule regarding the necessary parties to"
"an application for a writ of certiorari is that the person or authority whose decision of"
"exercise of power is sought to be quashed should be made Respondent to the application."
"If it is a body of persons whose decisions or exercise of power is sought to be quashed each"
"of the persons constituting such body who took part in taking the impugned decision or the"
"exercise   of   power   should   be   made   Respondent.   The   failure   to   make   him   or   them"
"Respondents to this application is fatal and provides in itself the grounds for the dismissal"
"of application in limine.”"
