"Thereafter the said objections too had been deliberated by the Wages Board (3R9). The said"
"deliberations too had concluded on a majority decision. Subsequently, the said final decision"
"had been transmitted to the Minister for his approval pursuant to section 29 of the Wages"
"Board Ordinance."
"On close examination  of section 29 of the Wages Board Ordinance, I find that once the"
"Wages Board decides to publish the proposed decision, it is also empowered to decide on a"
"date which on or before the objections to the proposed decision had to be submitted. In this"
"instance, the Wages Board had given a specific date in compliance with the provisions of the"
"Ordinance."
"The Respondents submitted that the said objection has been deliberated by the Wages Board,"
"while the Petitioners contended the objections have not been properly considered. Thus, the"
"Petitioners’   contention   becomes   a   disputed   fact.   The   minutes   of   the   said   Wages   Board"
"meeting   which   considered   the   objections   have   been   tendered   to   this   Court,   which"
"demonstrates the consideration of the objections. However, there is no evidence before this"
"Court to ascertain whether it was properly considered or not, especially in the absence of the"
"employers’  representatives  to the Wages  Board who have not been made  a party to this"
"application.  In any event, when the facts  are in dispute, a writ Court will be hesitant to"
"exercise its jurisdiction. In Thajudeen Vs Sri Lanka Tea Board and another (1981) 2 SLR"
"471  it was held  “Where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the facts is"
"subject to controversy and it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a suit"
"where parties would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses so that the Court"
"would be better able to judge which version is correct, a writ will not issue.”"
"It should also be noted that the statute is silent on the time period that should be given to"
"tender objections. In my view, a sufficient time period should be given for objections. The"
"Petitioners have submitted the minutes of the said Wages Board meeting to this Court marked"
"as CA5. The said minutes demonstrate that the 2nd  Respondent has answered the objection"
"pertaining to the time period given for objections. Further, it also demonstrates deliberations"
"pertaining to the objections raised. Thus, the Wages Board had deliberated the objections"
"where the employers’ representatives have been heard.  In view of the above, I am unable to"
"agree with the Petitioners’ submission that they have not been heard properly in considering"
"the objections submitted."
