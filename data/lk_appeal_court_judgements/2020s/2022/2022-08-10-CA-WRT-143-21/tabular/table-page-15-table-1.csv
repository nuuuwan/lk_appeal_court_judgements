"as it purported to reflect the events occurring before the Wages Board arrived at the proposed"
"decision."
"In Biso Menika Vs Cyril De Alwis & others 1982 (1) SLR 368 it was held “A person who"
"applies for the extra-ordinary remedy of writ must come with clean hands and must not"
"suppress  any relevant  facts  from Court.  He must refrain  from making  any  misleading"
"statements  to Court”.  The importance  of coming to court with clean hands was recently"
"stressed   in  Orient   Pearl   Hotels   vs   Cey   Nor-Foundation   Limited   &   others   CA   Writ"
"226/2018 decided on 02.08.2021  where it was held  “It is settled law that a party seeking"
"prerogative relief should come to court with clean hands. The expression is derived from"
"one of equity’s maxims – He who comes to Equity must come with clean hands.”"
"If the Petitioners were not in possession of the official minutes, the Petitioners were duty-"
"bound to disclose the same to Court, especially in view of the fact that the Petitioners were"
"seeking to impugn the relevant decision on the basis that the Wages Board had not considered"
"all relevant facts before arriving at the proposed decision taken on 08.02.2021. I also observe"
"that the Petitioners should not have marked the said document P9 stating it’s a true copy of"
"the minutes to the petition when it was not so. It is observed the Petitioners have failed to"
"explain   the   discrepancies   between   the   official   version   of   the   minutes   and   the   purported"
"minutes reflected in P9."
"The Petitioners also contended that the said sum of Rs 1000 had been arrived at due to an"
"election pledge. The Petitioners strenuously contended that the three main representatives of"
"the Minister had voted to increase the minimum wages to Rs.1000 and the Wages Board had"
"not considered the relevant facts in making the decision. The only way the Petitioners could"
"establish these facts was by submitting the authenticated minutes of the Wages Board for tea"
"and rubber. I find the Petitioners have failed to submit the minutes of the Wages Board for"
"the tea industry. In the absence of such, this Court would not be in a position to consider"
"whether the relevant facts that the Petitioner alleges had been considered by the Wages Board"
"on the tea trade or not."
"However, the Respondents annexed the Wages Board decision for the tea trade. (1R5, 2R1,"
"10R3).   As   reflected   in   the   said   minute,   the   Chairman   of   the   Wages   Board   presented   a"
"PowerPoint   presentation   when   the   proposal   for   the   minimum   wage   increase   had   been"
"considered. This fact had not been disclosed by the Petitioner. Further, as demonstrated in the"
"said minutes, the Wages Board had discussed percentage-wise the salary increases that had"
"been granted. I find that the Petitioners have failed to disclose these facts to the Court which"
"amounts to suppression of material facts."
"One  of the  main   contentions  of  the  Petitioners   was   that,  the  Wages  Board  decision  was"
"preordained and such submissions were in line with a manifesto pertaining to a presidential"
"election of increasing wages to Rs.1000 or 1500 (P5, P6) and, the Minster’s representatives"
"and   the   Minister   instead   of   exercising   their   own   judgment,   acted   to   impose   Rs.1000"
"minimum wage.  However, I find that as per the documents, the agitation by the workers to"
