"brought before this Court with an entitlement of a daily wage of Rs 405 (as per P13(a)). The"
"learned Counsel appearing for 5th and 7th Respondents submitted to this Court, that from the"
"time the Wages Board decision was published, most of the regional plantation companies had"
"been paying the sum determined by the Wages Board."
"The learned Counsel for 1st and 2nd Respondents drew the attention of this Court to documents"
"1R1 and 1R2, whereby he submitted that out of the total workforce of approximately 653,666"
"workers, the Petitioners are employing approximately around 120,000 and further submitted"
"that   though   the   Petitioners   objected   to   the   Wages   Board   decision,   most   of   the   workers"
"engaged   in   the   respective   industries   pertaining   to   the   Wages   Board   decision   are   already"
"benefitting from the impugned Wages Board decisions. It was also submitted to Court, that"
"given the economic situation, there would be a serious administrative inconvenience if the"
"entire workforce has to be satisfied with the daily wage as per P13(a)."
"It is also pertinent to note, that the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel appearing for the Petitioners"
"submitted that they would not curtail the wages only to the amounts reflected in P13(a)."
"However,   as   submitted,   this   Court   observes   that   with   the   repudiation   of   the   collective"
"agreement that was in existence prior to the Wages Board decision and in the absence of the"
"Wages Board decisions impugned, what would remain is the wages reflected in P13(a)."
"This Court observes that all the Counsels in their submissions have referred to the cost-of-"
"living factor as well. It is also pertinent to note, that the Petitioners themselves have taken the"
"privilege to plead that due to the expert management of the companies, the Petitioners had"
"been able to make a loss-making venture into a very profitable venture."
"In this context, I am of the view that relief by way of a writ cannot be sought as of a right. It"
"is a discretionary remedy. Even if the Petitioner has a strong case, and grounds exist for the"
"issuance of a writ of certiorari the courts may still not be inclined to grant relief based on"
"other pertinent and important grounds, such as grave Public/administrative inconvenience."
