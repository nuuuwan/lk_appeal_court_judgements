"Hence, it is clear that the Minister only approves the decision of the  Wages Board  and is"
"confirmed. Once the approved decision of the Wages Board is published in the gazette, only"
"then it will come into effect. This is further buttressed by the provisions of section 30 as it"
"empowers the Wages Board to rescind or vary a decision by way of a subsequent decision of"
"the Wages Board and section 32 of the said Act specifically states as follows;"
"The said Section 32 reads as follows: -"
"“Every decision of a Wages Board under this Ordinance shall, from the date on which"
"such decision comes into force, have effect notwithstanding anything in any written law"
"(other than this Ordinance), and made by any board or person under any such written"
"law”.  Accordingly, it is clear what comes into effect is the Wages Board decision which is"
"only being approved by the Minister."
"The Respondents also contended that the Petitioners have failed to name the parties who"
"would   be   adversely   affected   by   the   outcome   of   this   application.   In   the   decided   case   of"
"Rawaya  Publishers   and  Others  V.  Wijedasa  Rajapaksa,  Chairman   Sri  Lanka  Press"
"Council & Others (2003) 3 SLR 213  it was held,  “In the context of writ applications, a"
"necessary party is one without whom no order can be effectively made. A proper party is"
"one in whose absence an effective order can be made but whose presence is necessary to a"
"complete and final decision on the question involved in the proceedings. In the case of Udit"
"Narayan Singh v Board of Revenue, it has been held that where a writ application is filed"
"in respect of an order of the Board of Revenue not only the Board itself is a necessary party"
"but also the parties in whose favour the Board has pronounced the impugned decision"
"because without them no effective decision can be made. If they are not made parties then"
"the petition can be dismissed in limine. It has also been held that persons vitally affected by"
"the writ petition are all necessary parties. If their number is very large, some of them could"
"be made respondents in a representative capacity.”"
"It   is   clear   that   the   party   that   would   be   most   affected   would   be   the   estate   workers,   and"
"accordingly, I find that the Petitioners have failed to add the workers’ representatives or the"
"workers to this application.   Beneficiaries of the wage increase of Rs. 1000 are the estate"
"workers who have been given a pledge as submitted by the Petitioners through the manifesto"
"of the candidate of the President-elect (who are in the regional plantation companies as well"
"as   small   holdings).   Hence   the   Respondents’   contention   that   the   estate   workers   are   not"
"represented in this application has merit."
"It is also apparent to note that the two regional plantation companies namely, Agalawatta"
"Plantation PLC and Pussellawa Plantation PLC, which will be affected by this decision have"
"not   been   made   parties.   It   was   submitted   that   the   said   companies   have   been   paying   the"
"minimum wage as per the Wages Board decision.  Even though they have been paying the"
"minimum wage as per the Wages Board decision, I find there is no evidence to demonstrate"
"whether the said companies too had objected to the minimum daily wage."
"However,   the   decision   of   this   application   would   affect   the   said   two   companies.   The"
"Petitioners further submitted that there was no necessity to make them parties as they have"
