"The police statement of the appellant's husband stated that the appellant did not look like she was"
"bearing a child. It was an undisputed fact that the appellant delivered the baby alone, unattended and"
"unassisted. Counsel for the appellant stated that the learned Trial Judge has not taken into account"
"the unexpected and sudden turn of events which had taken the appellant by complete surprise when"
