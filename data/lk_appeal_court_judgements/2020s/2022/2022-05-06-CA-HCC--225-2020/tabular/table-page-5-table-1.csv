"and development of the child. Under Article 36 of the CRC, State is obliged to protect the child against"
"all other forms of exploitation prejudicial to any aspects of the child's welfare."
"The learned counsel for the respondent further says that Article 3 of the Convention provides that in"
"all actions concerning  children whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions,"
"courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies the best interests of the child shall be a"
"primary consideration. Therefore, the learned SSC submitted that the sentence imposed on an offence"
"of this nature should be in line with the above, which heavily focuses on the need to recognize the"
"inherent right to life of every child and the survival and development of the child."
"She  argued  that  deterrent  punishments  are  necessary  to  protect  children  from  future  offenders."
"Section 308 of the Penal Code provides that the exposure and abandonment of a child under 12 years"
"by a parent or person having care of such child is a punishable offence; ""Whoever, being the father or"
"mother of the child under the age of 12 years, or having care of such a child, shall expose or leave such"
"child  in  any  place  to  wholly  abandon  such  a  child,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either"
"description for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine or with both."""
"The  explanation  at  section  308  of  the  Penal  Code  provides  thus;  ""this  section  is  not  intended  to"
"prevent the trial of the offender for murder or culpable homicide, the case may be if the child dies in"
"consequences of the exposure"". The actions of the accused-appellant amount to the commission of"
"the said offence along with the offence for which she was initially indicted. In the circumstances, the"
"learned  Senior  State  Counsel  argued  that  the  accused-appellant  has  already  been  the  recipient  of"
"leniency, in terms of the offence for which she was indicted, convicted and sentenced."
"After considering all of the above arguments, it is my view that the learned Trial Judge, in assessing a"
"proper sentence for the appellant, has not duly appreciated the post conduct of the appellant by which"
"she  did  not  attempt  to exonerate  her.  The  appellant  herself  identified  the  dead  body of  the  baby"
"before  Judicial  Medical  Officer,  confessed  to  the  police.  Then  she  readily  surrendered  to  genus"
"comparison  thereby  facilitating  to  truncate  of  what  otherwise  would  have  followed  a  daunting,"
"prolonging and complex investigation process and demonstrating her remorse from the earliest. The"
"appellant had pleaded guilty to the indictment at the very instance. During the trial, she did not raise"
"any affirmative defence. The appellant states that she who was 38 years old at the time of the incident"
"is now 50 years old."
"The learned counsel for the appellant states that, following this unfortunate incident, her husband"
"deserted her leaving the burden of both her children aged 11 and 14 on her shoulder. It was out of"
"her meagre earnings as a domestic aid that she raised her two children with terminal effort. Her son"
"is now married yet her daughter aged 21 is still dependent on her. The learned counsel further states"
"that she has an enormous responsibility lying on her shoulder as a single mother to protect and sustain"
"her daughter until she is given in marriage. The appellant grieves that, if she was incarcerated in the"
"execution of the custodial sentence imposed on her, her daughter would run the risk of her whole life"
"further being disrupted and disorganised."
"On this premise, the learned counsel for the accused-appellant submits on behalf of the appellant that"
"justice would have been better served by imposing on the appellant a non-custodial sentence."
"The power of the Court of Appeal to vary a sentence is indicated in section 336 of the Code of Criminal"
"Procedure Act (CCPA). It empowers the Court of Appeal to interfere with a sentence imposed by the"
"High Court in appropriate circumstances."
"Section 336 of the CCPA reads as follows;"
