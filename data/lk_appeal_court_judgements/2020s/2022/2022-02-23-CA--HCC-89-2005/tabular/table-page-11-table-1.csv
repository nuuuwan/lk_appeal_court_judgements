"The grounds of appeal urged by the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel was the failure on the part"
"of the learned Judge of the High Court to consider the improbabilities of the version of the"
"prosecution. It is pertinent at this stage to consider the chain of events that had taken place"
"on  16.03.2000  during  the  raid  before  the  arrest  of  the  accused  person.    The  story  of  the"
"prosecution is in many ways improbable. The evidence of the prosecution, if we take them as"
"a whole, the testimony about the raid conducted does not inspire confidence."
"The inbuilt improbabilities in the version of the prosecution which will go to show that no"
"conviction could be  possible even if  the evidence of the witnesses are taken on their face"
"value, warrant a court dealing with a criminal appeal not to shut its eyes particularly when"
"the criminal proceedings set in motion against the appellant appear to be a probable cause"
"of  abuse  of  process  of  Court  to  put  the  appellant's  liberty  in  jeopardy.  Though  the  legal"
"proposition points towards such evidence not strictly requiring corroboration, in the singular"
"facts and circumstances of the present case, having regard to the quality of the version of the"
"prosecution  about  the  incident,  it  cannot  be  safely  relied  upon  to  sustain  the  conviction"
"against the accused of multifaceted reasons."
"Taking into consideration, all these circumstances, I am of the view that the conviction of the"
"accused cannot be allowed to stand as the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond"
"all reasonable doubts. Accused-appellant is acquitted from all charges in the indictment."
"The appeal is allowed and the conviction quashed."
"Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgement along with the original case record to"
"the High Court of Colombo."
