"the pertinent fact that the said partition action was contested between ex-husband and"
"ex-wife to the property jointly owned during the marriage”."
"T
he Respondent contends that by permitting this application:"
"a.  The legislative intention  in  establishing  the  High  Court  of  the  Provinces  by  the"
"Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the enactment of the High Court"
"of the Provinces Acts will be defeated."
"b.  The floodgates will be opened for litigants who have failed or neglected to exercise"
"their  right  of  appeal  under  Section  5C  and  for

 that argument is accepted, section 5C becomes meaningless, and the intention of the"
