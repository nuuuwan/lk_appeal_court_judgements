"“The power of restitution differs from revisionary power of this court in that the latter is"
"exercised where the legality or propriety of any order or proceedings of a lower court is questioned."
"Restitution reinstates a party to his original legal condition which he has been deprived of by the"
"operation of law. Thus, it follows, the remedy can be availed of only by one who is actually a party"
"to the legal proceeding in respect of which restitution is desired.”"

"in its jurisdiction touching upon an issue and if a Petitioner seeks to revive and revisit"
"that issue in this Court, this Court cannot usurp a jurisdiction which it does not have, in"
"the guise of restitutio in integrum. This is because the Supreme Court is the highest and"
