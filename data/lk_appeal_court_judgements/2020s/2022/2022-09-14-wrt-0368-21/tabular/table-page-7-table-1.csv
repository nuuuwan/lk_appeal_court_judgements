"determine  the  instant  application.  The  learned  State  Counsel  refers  to  the  following"
"passage of the said Weragama case in order to substantiate the Respondent’s argument."
"“if a law or Statue is covered by a matter in the (exclusive) Provincial Council List, but not"
"otherwise, the exercise of powers there under is subject to the Writ jurisdiction of the High"
"Court”"
"In my view, as succinctly elaborated by Mark Fernando J. in the same Weragama case"
"there is no ambiguity in the language in Article 154P(4) by which  the Provincial High"
"Court  has  been  given  the  power  to  issue  writs  in  respect  of  the  matters  set  out  in  the"
"Provincial  Council  List  of  the  Ninth  Schedule  of  the  Constitution.  However,  what  is"
"pertinent to the instant application is whether the writ jurisdiction vested in the Court of"
"Appeal under Article 140 and 141 of the Constitution has been taken away from the Court"
"of Appeal in respect of matters set out in the said Provincial Council List. Mark Fernando"
"J.  in  the  above Weragama case,  in  reference  to  Article  154P(4),  made  it  clear  that  it  is"
"nothing more than a re-arrangement of the jurisdictions of the judiciary and further that"
"the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 140 & 141 is entrenched."
"In Kalu Arachchige Allen Nona vs. Sunil Weerasinghe, Commissioner of Agrarian"
"Development and others CA/Writ/23/2013 decided on 10.06.2016, His  Lordship"
"Justice  Vijith  Malalgoda  PC  (P/CA)  (as  His  Lordship  then  was)  has  followed  the"
"consistent  principles  in  the  above  Weragama  case  (and  also  in  Nilwala Vidulibala"
"Company (Pvt) Ltd vs. Kotapala Pradeshiya Sabha and others (2005) 1 Sri. L.R. 296"
"and has decided as follows;"
"“….Under  these  circumstances  it  is  understood  that  with  regard  to  the  applications  come"
"within  Article  154P(4)  of  the  Constitution,  Provincial  High  Courts  are  conferred  with"
"concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Appeal.”"
"Therefore, in line with the precedent laid down by the aforesaid judgements, I take the"
"view that it is settled law that the writ jurisdiction vested in Court of Appeal under Article"
"140 & 141 of the Constitution has not been partially taken away by the 13th Amendment"
"to the Constitution in respect of the matters set out in the Provincial Council List of the"
"Ninth Schedule of the  Constitution. Moreover, the High Court of the Province  has the"
"concurrent writ jurisdiction in respect of the matters set out in the said Provincial Council"
