"Therefore in the instant matter the case against the petitioner has gone down on"
"numerous occasions from 2014 to  up to date without conclusion, which runs in to"
"a span of nearly 10 years during which period the petitioner had been in remand"
"which this Court considers to be a delay which is oppressive and exceptional."
"Hence  the  instant  application  for  revision  is  allowed  and  the  order  of  the  High"
"Court  refusing  bail  is  set  aside  and  this  Court  directs  the  High  Court  Judge  to"
"impose suitable conditions of bail and enlarge the petitioner on bail."
"As such the instant application for revision is allowed."
