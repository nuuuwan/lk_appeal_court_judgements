"“It  is  inconceivable  that  one  could  apply  the  test  of  contemporaneity  or"
"spontaneity  in rape  matters especially  in child rape matters.  A perusal of"
"the proceedings itself will give an indication as to how reluctant the victim"
"was to come out with the story at the trial in the High Court. A fair amount"
"of coaxing and persuasion which is justified under the circumstances was"
"needed to extract the evidence from the victim.”"
