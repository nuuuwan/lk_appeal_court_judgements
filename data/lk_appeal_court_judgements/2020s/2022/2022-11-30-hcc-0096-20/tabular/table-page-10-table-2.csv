"Dr. K.S. Narayana Reddy at page 308 states as follows:"
"“The slightest penetration of the penis within the vulva, such as the minimal"
"passage  of  glands  between  the  labia  or  with  or  without  the  emission  of"
"semen or rupture of hymen constitutes rape. There need not be a completed"
"act  of  intercourse.  Rape  can  be  committed  even  when  there  is  inability  to"
"produce a penile erection. Rape can occur without causing any injury and"
"as such negative evidence does not exclude rape.”"
