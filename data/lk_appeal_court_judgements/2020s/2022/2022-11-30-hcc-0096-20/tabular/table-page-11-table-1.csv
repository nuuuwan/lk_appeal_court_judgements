"It is my considered view that the evidence led in this action clearly establishes"
"the fact that the offence of rape as described in Section 363 (e) of the Penal Code"
"has been committed on the victim child by the appellant."
"I find no merit in the argument that there was no corroboration to support the"
"versions of events as narrated by the victim child. It is very much clear from the"
"evidence as to the reasons as to why the other child relating to count number"
"two of the indictment, which was a count of abduction, has not given evidence"
"in  Court.  According  to  the  evidence  of  other  witnesses,  the  child  was  married"
"when the case came up for trial and had been suffering again at the hands of her"
"mother-in-law due to the discovery of the fact that she is a witness in this case."
"That may be the very reason why she has failed to appear before the Court to"
"give evidence."
"However, it was the evidence of a neighbour that she saw the victim child and"
"the other child entering the house of the appellant."
"It was the evidence of the mother of the child, that after hearing that her daughter"
"entered  the  house  of  the  appellant,  she  went  to  his  house  and  the  door  was"
"closed. Her efforts to get the door opened has failed. It was the neighbours who"
"gathered had broken open the house door where they have found the appellant"
"and the victim child inside. The victim child had been shivering and seated in a"
"corner of the house when she was discovered. The mother and the neighbours"
"have  immediately  taken  the  child  to  the  police  station  and  from  there  to  the"
"hospital.  I  find  that  these  circumstances  provide  ample  corroboration  of  the"
"evidence  of  the  victim  child.  There  is  no  basis  to  conclude  that  there  was  no"
"corroboration."
"It is settled law that in a charge of this nature, even without corroboration, if the"
"evidence  of  the  victim  is  cogent  and  trustworthy,  such  evidence  can  be  acted"
"upon."
