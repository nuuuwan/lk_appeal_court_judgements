"the plan submitted to this Court does not display such a contrast. The inspection report prior to"
"issuing a development permit which was marked as 5R9 under clause 15 specifically requests"
"to  answer  the  question  as  to  whether  the  proposed  amendments  are  depicted  in  red  and  the"
"answer is in the negative. It is pertinent to note that as per the 5th Respondentâ€™s contention if"
"the  proposed  construction  was  for  an  amendment to the  ground  floor, then  the  old  building"
"should have been depicted in one colour.  However, the failure of the developer to follow the"
"guidelines of the colour coding in the plan demonstrates that from the inception their intention"
"had been to construct a new building rather than effecting an amendment to the existing ground"
"floor."
"The petitioner argued that the said two shops had long been abundant and not used thus when"
"the portion of land was acquired for the road construction the said building was already in a"
"delipidated condition. Therefore, they argued that the necessity for renovation subsequent to"
"the acquisition does not arise."
