"The learned High Court Judge had further observed that the writ prayed by the Petitioner was to"
"stop the enforcement of the Magistrate's order. In the case of Bandaranayake Vs. Weerarathna1"
"says, ""There is a general rule in the construction of statutes that what a court or person is prohibited"
"from doing directly, it may not be done indirectly or in a  circuitous manner. According to this"
"judgment, what the learned High Court Judge had observed stands true in the present case."
"When perusing the reasoning of the Petitioner, the only ground of defence he had taken was time."
"He had challenged that the certificate was concerning something that had happened eight years"
"ago. Therefore, the certificate should not be considered."
"As discussed above, this position does not fall into any ground on which the certificate can be"
"challenged."
"On the other hand, the Petitioner had not shown that he had carried out his duties diligently by"
"acting under Section 43A (2) of the Act. He had given reasons to believe that he had submitted"
"statements of accounts to the Registrar within three months of the close of the financial year."
