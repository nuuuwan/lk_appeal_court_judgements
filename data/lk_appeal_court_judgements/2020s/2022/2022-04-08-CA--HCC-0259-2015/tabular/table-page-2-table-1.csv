"T
his appeal is from the judgment, delivered by the learned Judge of the High Court of Kalutara,"
"dated 15.12.2015, by which, the accused-appellant, who is before this Court, was convicted and"
"sentenced to death for having committed the murder of one Mohamed Izzadeen Mohamed Izzad"
"(the deceased) on or about 07.01.1999."
"The  accused-appellant  had  been  indicted  on  08.08.2006  in  the  High  Court  of  Kalutara  for"
"committing the murder of Mohamed Izzadeen Mohamed Izzad on or about 07.01.1999, which is"
"punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code."
"The trial had commenced on 23.10.2008 after the accused-appellant opted for a non-jury trial."
"The prosecution had, led evidence of 8 witnesses and marked the productions පැ - 1 and පැ - 2."
"Once the prosecution had closed its case the accused-appellant gave evidence from the witness"
"box and had called his brother as a defence witness.  At the conclusion of the trial, the accused-"
"appellant had been found guilty on the murder charge and sentenced to death. Aggrieved by the"
"said decision the accused-appellant preferred this appeal."
"The  case  for  the  prosecution  relied  on  direct  and  circumstantial  evidence.  There  were  2"
"eyewitnesses in this case namely PW 1 and PW 2. The learned High Court Judge has decided to"
"disregard the evidence of the mother of the deceased who was the PW 1. She has forgotten the"
"incident which took place 10 years ago. The learned Counsel for the respondent argued that the"
"decision of the  learned High  Court  Judge to disregard the  evidence  of PW  1  was  a  justifiable"
"decision due to her old age and being illiterate."
"Mohamed  Izzadeen  Mohamed  Imran  (PW-02),  giving  evidence  before  the  learned  trial  Judge"
"nearly 14 years after the indent, has stated that the deceased is his elder brother and as at the"
"date of the incident, he was living with his wife and children. That was in his wife's house and"
"the deceased brother and their parents were living separately, three houses away."
"This was a date during the Islamic Holy month of Ramadhan and he was fasting. He had returned"
"from the  mosque  after performing  the noon  prayers.  While he  was  inside the  house, he had"
"heard a sound and when he came out of the house, he had seen his deceased brother, hitting a"
"boy named Saman for plucking and stealing 'Kurumba' from the deceased brother’s plantation."
"Thereafter said 'Saman' (brother of the appellant) had been crying and proceeded towards his"
"house. The deceased brother had proceeded towards a boutique of Zarook, that was situated in"
"the vicinity. He had then gone back into the house and while he was engaged in religious activity,"
"he had heard the person named 'Sunil' (Appellant) calling his brother."
"The second incident of accused-appellant, took place having arrived near their house and calling"
"for  the  deceased.  It  took  place  around  half  an  hour  after  the  first  incident  of  his  brother"
"assaulting a boy named Saman. Though this witness has come out of the house, the appellant"
"has asked as to where 'Izzad' the deceased has gone. Then he had told this witness' I have no"
"issues  with  you  and  I  will  resolve  it  with  'Izzad'  and  proceeded  towards  the  direction  of  the"
"Boutique of `Zarook'."
