"incident was the wife of the deceased Anula Gunawardene in her evidence she had stated that"
"she  identified  the  1st,  2nd  and  4th  accused-appellants.  She  could  not  identify  the  other  two"
"persons who were present near her house. The other inmate Manika who was present at the"

"against the 2nd and 3rd accused-appellants depended on the evidence of Jayanthi, the sister of"
"the  deceased.  Jayanthi  when  giving  evidence  in  the  Magistrate  Court  was  unable  to  say  the"
"weapon that the 3rd accused was carrying. But in her evidence in the High Court, she stated that"
"the 3rd accused was having a sword. This contradiction was marked as V 1."

"the deceased. But in her evidence in the High Court, she stated that she saw the 3rd accused"
"attacking the deceased with a sword. Jayanthi in her evidence in the High Court has stated that"

"after the attack on her brother she met her aunt Danawathie and told Danawathi that it was the"
"1st accused who killed her brother. She failed to maintain to Dhanawathie the fact that the 2nd"
"and 3rd accused attacked her brother."
"Court held “when we consider all these matters, we think that Jayanthi is not a credible witness."
"The learned trial judge has considered the said contradictions and omissions. But he failed to"
"appreciate  the  value  of  the  said  contradictions  and  omissions  in  deciding  the  credibility  of"
"Jayanthi.”"
"It is important to note that in the above-mentioned authorities the contradictions and omissions"
"which go to the root of the case should not be ignored lightly and the trial Judge  should give"
"proper attention when he finally decides whether the accused is guilty or not for the offence he"
"was charged."
"In the present case, PW 2 failed to mention Saman's name in the police statement. This is marked"
"as an omission by the defence counsel."
