"read ejusdem generis to mean similar in nature to the class of persons who"
"exert  authority,  make  binding  decisions  and  exert  control  over 
the"
"business  of 
the  body  corporate  as  a  director,  general  manager  or"
"secretary."
"The doctrine of ejusdem generis is applied when some specified words are"
"followed  by  the  general  words.  As  such,  the  words  ‘director’,  ‘general"
"manager’ and ‘secretary’ are specific words, and the words ‘similar officer’"
"is general. As there is ambiguity as to whether the appellants, namely the"
"Regional Manager, Production Manager and Assistant Production Manager"
"of Manthai Salt Ltd, would fall within the meaning of ‘similar officer’, this"
"Court will utilize the doctrine of ejusdem generis  to achieve the purpose"
"or objective of the Act. This doctrine provides that the general words which"
"follow  the  specified  words  will  be  restricted  to  the  same  class  of  the"
"specified  words.  As  held  in Viscount  Simonds  in  Attorney  General  v."
"Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover, (1957) AC 436 at 461 of the report,"
"“…when general words are juxtaposed with specific words, general words"
"cannot be read in isolation. Their color and their contents are to be derived"
"from their context.”

"Hence,  it  is  incumbent  on  this  Court  to  ascertain  whether  the  Regional"
"Manager, Production Manager and Assistant Production Manager could be"
"placed  within  the  similar  class  as  a  ‘director’,  ‘general  manager’  and"
"‘secretary’."
"When 
the 
legislature  stipulated  specific  words  of 
‘director,  general"
"manager,  secretary’,  it  is  clear  that  their  intention  was  to  restrict  the"
"imposition  of  liability  to  those  within  the  body  corporate  who  has  the"
"authority and control to make high-level decisions regarding the business"
"carried  out  and  who  amply  represent  the  entire  body  corporate.  This"
"excludes  ordinary  employees  of  the  body  corporate.  Had  the  legislature"
"intended all employees of the body corporate to be held liable in the event"
