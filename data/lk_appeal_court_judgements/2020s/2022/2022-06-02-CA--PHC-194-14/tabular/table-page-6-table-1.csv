"the circumstances having regard to the nature of his functions."

"Neither party dispute the fact that Manthai Ltd is a body corporate. The"
"only  dispute  is  whether  the  appellants,  namely  the  Regional  Manager,"
"Production  Manager  and  Assistant  Production  Manager  of  Manthai  Salt"
"Ltd, can be held liable for committing an offence as per Section 18(1)(a) of"
"the Act."
"The  counsel  for  the  appellants  submitted  that  none  of  the  directors  of"
"Manthai Ltd had been named as the accused in the Magistrate Court Case"
"filed by the respondent. The three officers who were charged were merely"
"asked to appear for an inquiry where they were produced before Court on"
"a Saturday, remanded, and later released on bail. The counsel's contention"
"for the appellants is that the appellants cannot be considered within the"
"category of “director, general manager, secretary or other similar officer”"
"as  envisaged  in  Section  27  of  the  Act.  The  counsel  for  the  appellant"
"submitted  that  the  very  same  objection  as  raised  before  the  Magistrate"
"Court which was overruled on 02.10.2012. The counsel referred to the said"
"order (Vide Page 51 of the English Translation of the Brief) and submitted"
"that  the  rationale  for  such  overruling  by  the  Magistrate  was  the  advice"
"tendered  by  the Attorney  General,  which  the  Magistrate himself  sought."
"Next,  the  counsel  for  the  appellants  referred  to  Section  60(7)  of  the"
"Consumer  Affairs  Authority  Act,  No.09  of  2003,  which  stipulates  ‘every"
"director  and  every  officer  of  that  body’  is  deemed  guilty  of  the  offence"
"committed under the Consumer Affairs Authority Act. The counsel for the"
"appellant contrasted Section 69 (7) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act"
"with Section 27 of the Act to state that in the former, the legislature has"
"intended to hold a wider group of people liable, whereas, in the latter, the"
"legislature has specifically limited the liability to a group of persons within"
"the  body  corporate,  i.e.,  director,  general  manager,  secretary  or  other"
