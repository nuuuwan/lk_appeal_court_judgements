"petitioner  has  failed  to  establish  before  the  Magistrate  that  she  had"
"ownership of the cattle in terms of the provisions of the relevant act."
"The law relating to the instant matter falls within the Animals Act no 29 of"
"1958  and 
it  has  specifically  stated  as  to  how  a  cattle  owner  should"
"prepare the cattle voucher in terms of the Animals Act of No.29 of 1958 to"
"be  read  with  the  Gazette  Notification  dated  26/11/2009  which  has  said"
"that “any cattle sold, the buyer and the owner of the cattle shall sign the"
"cattle voucher before the Government Veterinary Surgeon of the area in"
"which  the  cattle  is  kept  and  the  Government  Veterinary  Surgeon  shall"
"handover the perfected cattle voucher to the buyer or the new owner of"
"the cattle”, but the document marked as E1 submitted by the petitioner"
"at  the  inquiry  is  not  in  compliance  of  the  said  regulation.  Therefore  the"
"Magistrate had disregarded her evidence and has confiscated the cattle."
"This matter has been discussed in the case of  CA (PHC) APN 22/2018 by"
"this bench on 08.03.2022 where it has discussed the Cattle Voucher which"
"should  be  in  the  possession  of  a  person  who  claims  ownership  to  cattle"
"under the provisions of the Animals Act No.29 of 1958, Section 3(d) 6, 7,"
"8(2)."
"Therefore as the petitioner has failed to produce the relevant documents"
"in  compliance  of  the  act,  Learned  High  Court  Judge  has  observed  that"
"there is no exceptional illegality in the Order of the Magistrate."
"Therefore  as  per  the 
law  cited  above  we  do  not  see  any  reason  to"
"interfere  with  the  judgment  of  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  hence  the"
"instant application is hereby dismissed."
