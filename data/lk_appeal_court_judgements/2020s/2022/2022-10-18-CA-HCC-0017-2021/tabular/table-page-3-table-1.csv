"","iii. 
The  learned  trial  Judge  did  not  evaluate  the"
"","defence evidence from the correct perspective"
"","and rejected the same in a wrong premise."
"2.","The  brief  facts  of  the  case  as  per  the  evidence  of  the"
"","prosecution are as follows;"
"","The  Chief  Inspector  Ansalam  Silva  (PW1),  has  been"
"","serving in the Colombo crimes division. Upon receiving"
"","information from a private informant, he has organized"
"","the raid in question. The information had been that, a"
"","person  would  be  coming  near 
the  bridge  at  Leslie"
"","Ranagala  Mawatha  carrying  heroin.  Accordingly,  he"
"","has gone to the area in a van attached to their division"
"","along with the other police officers. They have stopped"
"","the vehicle near the air force official quarters, and had"
"","proceeded 
towards 
the  bridge  at  Leslie  Ranagala"
"","Mawatha.  He  has  walked  slowly  while  observing  the"

"","the  suspect  who  was  coming

the  bridge,"
"","according  to  the  information  he  received.  When  the"
"","appellant  came  close  to  him,  he  has  called  him  out,"
"","taken him to a side of the road and searched him. His"
"","officers,  Fonseka  and  Bandara  have  been  standing"
"","close  to  him.  When  he  searched  the  appellant,  he  has"
"","felt that there was a parcel inside his underwear. Then,"
"","he  has  discovered  a  red  coloured  cellophane  bag  that"
"","contained heroin in his underwear."
"3.","All three grounds of appeal will be discussed together."
"","The  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted  that,"
"","the  evidence  of  the  prosecution  witnesses,  that  the"
"","raiding  party  waited 
for  30-40  minutes  until 
the"
"","appellant 
arrived 
to

improbable."
"","Further,  it  is  the  contention  of  the  learned  Counsel"
"","that, although the PW1 states that the appellant came"
"","from the direction of Kaadar Waththa, he has failed to"
"","mention this in his notes. The learned Counsel further"
"","submitted

the  PW1
