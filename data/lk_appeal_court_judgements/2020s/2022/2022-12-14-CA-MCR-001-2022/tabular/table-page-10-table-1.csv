"Justice Salam (P/CA) echoed in CA/PHC/108/2010 (Supra) at page 6 of the judgment-"
"‘It is a magisterial duty which cannot be delegated to the police. Whether there is sufficient"
"ground to proceed against the suspect in the hands of a judicial officer who is expected to"
"address his mind judiciously. If the duty of framing the charge is to be entrusted others"
"the purposive approach to Section 182 will be rendered nugatory’."
"Hence, this Court opines that the impugned order is misconceived in law as the learned"
"Magistrate has failed  to  take into  consideration the lack of  material in  the submitted"
"reports  supporting  the  commission  of  the  alleged  crime  by  the  suspect.  This  will  be"
"discussed in detail in the next segment."
"Threshold requirement unmet"
"It  must  be  noted  that  Magistrates  are  not  routinely  required  to  evaluate  material"
"divulged at the completion of an investigation against the threshold of sufficiency and"
"reasonableness.   The special circumstance of the instant case is that the petitioner has"
"raised a preliminary objection based on Section 120(3) of the CPC. In such an instance,"
"it is the duty of the Magistrate to employ his discretion and make an inquiry into the"
"threshold criterion.  It is within the interest of justice to conduct such an inquiry before"
"the charges are formally read against the suspect. Therefore, it can be noted that the"
"petitioner  has  raised  the  preliminary  objections  well  within  the  correct  time  period,"
"before charges are formally read against him. In this instant case charges have not been"
"formally read over against the petitioner and the summons have not yet been served on"
"the  suspect-respondent.    Hence,  the  Magistrate  shall  at  this  juncture  entertain  such"
"preliminary objections and inquire into the threshold criterion."
"Upon a perusal of the facts and circumstances of the instant case, it is evident that the"
"virtual  complainant  refers  to  a  commercial  transaction  between  himself  and  the"
"incorporated entity named Horamulla Tea Plantation (Pvt) Ltd. The petitioner is one of"
"the Directors of the tea company. The complainant has not conducted any individual"
"transactions of a personal nature with the said director. (R1 the complaint to the Police"
"dated  17.03.2020  by  the  virtual  complainant-respondent)  The  agreement  of  sale  of"
"goods transpired between the Horamulla Tea Factory and the complainant, and, as such"
"the transactions therein transpired between the company and the complainant in the"
