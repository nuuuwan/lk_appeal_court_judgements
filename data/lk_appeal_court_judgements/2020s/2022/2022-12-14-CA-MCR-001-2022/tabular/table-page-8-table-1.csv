"However, what is absent in the analysis   is any independent reference to the materials"
"thus  disclosed  during  the  investigation.  Reiterating  the  submissions  made  by  both"
"parties is the first step in the exercise of the judicial discretion, but a judge should not"
"stop there. There must be some evidence that the judicial mind was applied to the facts"
"and law, independent of the submissions made by the parties."
"Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that when applying the judicial mind to the facts"
"and circumstances, the degree of evaluation    during the Section 120(3) stage of a case"
"is not  the same  as the degree  of evaluation at a later  stage-  such as the trial.  At  the"
"stage where Section 120(3) of the CPC, the discretion is utilized to assess a threshold of"
"“sufficiency” and not the threshold of beyond reasonable doubt. The minimum standard"
"of discretion to be used at Section 120(3) stage must be accompanied by evidence of an"
"independent  assessment  which  goes  beyond      the  restatement  of  what  the  parties’"
"submissions.   Framing of a charge does not, ipso facto, prevent the triggering of Section"
"120(3).  The contrary would  mean  that the discretion of a Magistrate to discharge the"
"suspects under Section 120(3) of the CPC is disallowed the moment a charge sheet has"
"been  framed.  Ordinarily,  a  Magistrate  does  not  frame  the  charges.  Instead,  the  draft"
"charges tendered by the prosecution will be accepted by the Magistrate and the same"
"will be perceived as the charges framed by the Magistrate himself. This view has been"
"endorsed in CA PHC 108/2010 CA minute dated 26.08.2014. However, the acceptance"
"by the Magistrate in the said instance is not a mechanical act of rubber stamping the"
"prosecution’s draft, it involves a judicious exercise of discretion. After such an exercise"
"and  the  charge  sheet  framed,  by  reason  of  it  being  considered  as  framed  by  the"
"Magistrate, then an option of discharge under Section 120(3) of the CPC will no longer"
"be  available.    Therefore  the  reference  in  Section  120(3)  to  “If  in  the  report  there  is  no"
"allegation  that  the  suspect  has  committed  or  been  concerned  in  the  committing  of  any"
"offence” and  “If the report alleges that the suspect has committed or been concerned in"
"committing  an  offence  he  shall  be  prosecuted  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this"
"Code”  is  a  reference  to  the  threshold  of  whether  the  Magistrate  is  satisfied  with  the"
"commission of an offence with a prima facie prospect of securing a conviction. To that"
"end, the Magistrate must make an independent assessment whether the draft charges"
"presented by the prosecution has any merit in it. He ought not to act as a mere rubber"
"stamp."
