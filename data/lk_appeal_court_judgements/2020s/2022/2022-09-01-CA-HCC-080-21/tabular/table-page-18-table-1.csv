"Furthermore,  PW3  stated  in  her  history  to  the  doctor  that  she  was"
"assaulted  with  something 
like a  knife.  However,  according  to  the"
"doctor,  her  injury  was  caused  by  a  blunt  weapon.  Following  that,"
"when  she  testified  in  court,  she  mentioned  about a  blunt  weapon."
"However,  there  is  a  contradiction  regarding  the  blunt  weapon  also"
"because in evidence in chief she stated that she was assaulted with a"
"pole  and in  cross-examination,  she  stated  that  she  was  hit  with  the"
"handle of a mamoty."
"In this form of assault, it is possible that the victim could not precisely"
"describe the weapon used. However, there could be no confusion as to"
"whether it is a knife or a pole. Undoubtedly, an incident has occurred"
"on that day. As a result PW3, as well as PW1 and PW2, were injured."
"Another  person  was  killed.  However,  when  the  aforesaid  deficiencies,"
"discrepancies,  and 
improbabilities  of  evidence  are  considered,  a"
"reasonable  doubt  arises  as  to  whether  the  PW3 
in 
fact  saw  the"
"incident  she  described.  Because  of  the  discrepancy  in  describing  the"
"weapon used in the assault and the fact that she saw two people enter"
"the  house  and  speaks  only  about  one  person's  involvement  in  her"
"evidence, as well as stating that the  assailant  was a person who was"
"in  their  houses  without  mentioning  the  name  of  the  appellant,  it"
"cannot  be  determined 
that  count  4  has  been  proved beyond  a"
"reasonable doubt."
"The Count No. 1 - Murder"
"PW3  is  the  only  witness  who  speaks  about  the  murder.  PW5,  the"
"neighbour,  stated 
the 
things  happened  after 
the  main 
incidents"
"occurred.  PW3  stated  that  she  saw  the  appellant  creeping  into  her"
"son’s room. However, immediately afterwards she had fallen down and"
"lost consciousness. A vital piece of evidence to consider is that before"
"falling down, she shouted that “someone had come to the house to kill"
"the  child”.  The  relevant  answer  given  by  her  appears  as  follows:  “ඊට"
"පසේනසේ මම දරුවො මරන්න කවුද න දරට ආවො කියලො කෑ  ැහුවො. ඊට පසේනසේ මම වැටුනො.”"
