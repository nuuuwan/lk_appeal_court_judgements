"witness’s  evidence  as  to  who  caused  the  injury  to  PW2,  there  is  no"
"evidence that the appellant caused the injury to PW2. Therefore, I hold"
"that the learned High Court Judge’s decision to  convict the appellant"
"for the 5th count is wrong."
"T
he Count No. 3"
"Now, I proceed to consider the conviction in respect of the 3rd  count."
"It’s an attempted murder charge  based on the injury caused  to  PW1."
"There  is  no  issue  regarding  the  nature  of  the  injury  that  resulted  in"
"attempted  murder.  The  issue  is  regarding  the  identity  of  the  person"
"who caused the injury. According to PW1’s evidence, after she went to"
"sleep, someone came to her room and demanded money. She said that"
"she does not have any. She was then hit on her head. PW1 stated that"
"she recognized the person who hit her as “Samare Mama” by his voice."
"So,  the  appellant  has  been  identified  by  the  voice  only  because  she"
"said that there was no sufficient light to see and identify a person. The"
"relevant question and answer appear as follows:"
"ප්‍ර: 
කොමරනේ ඉන්නන් කව්ද කියලො හදුනො  න්න තරම් ආනලෝකයක් තිබුනන් නැහැ?"
"උ: 
නෑ."
"(Page 128 and 129 of the appeal brief)"
"P
W1 stated further that she knew “Samare Mama” very well. Although"
"she said that she identified the appellant by his voice, she also stated"
"in evidence in chief that somebody demanded money from her."
"“පසේනසේ කියන්නන් ඒ නවලොනව් නනනව්, ඉන් පසේනසේ තමයි මනේ සල්ලි ඉල්ලල  ත්තො කව්රු"
"හරි. ඊට පසේනසේ මම සල්ලි නෑ කිව්වොට පසේනසේ  ැහුවො එච්චරයි දන්නන්.” (Page 73 of the"
"appeal brief). If the person demanded money was the “Samare mama”,"
"she could have said so without saying, “somebody” demanded money."
"When  she  said  “somebody”, 
it  appears  that  she  stated  about  an"
"unknown  person.  PW1  has  also  stated  that  she  couldn't  remember"
"whether  one  or  two  persons  came.  She  could  be  believed  if  she  said"
"she didn't see whether two persons or one person came. If she said"
"10"
