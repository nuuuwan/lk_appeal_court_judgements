"his  evidence,  Vasudevan  had  not  referred  to  the  identity  of  the  dead"
"person."
"When PW3 did not mention the appellant's name in the instant action,"
"the  State  Counsel  referred  to  the  appellant's  name  in  framing  the"
"question  implicating  the  appellant  in  the  offence.  So,  the  question"
"posed  by  the  learned  State  Counsel  in  this  case  is  more  detrimental"
"than 
the  question  posed  by 
the 
learned  State  Counsel 
in 
the"
"aforementioned  Supreme  Court 
case  because 
the 
identity  of  a"
"deceased  person  was  referred  to  in  that  case.  In  this  case,  the  State"
"Counsel  directly  mentioned  the  appellant's  name  when  PW3  said"
"nothing 
about 
the 
accused-appellant.  The  Honourable  Attorney"
"General indicted the appellant and another accused in this case. Even"
"though  the  question  was  not legally  permitted,  PW3  was  not  even"
"given an opportunity by the learned State Counsel to choose which of"
"the  accused,  first  or  second,  caused  the  injury  to  PW3.  Also,  it  was"
"held 
in 
the  said  Supreme  Court 
judgment 
that 
“the  manner  of"
"questioning not only diminishes the evidentiary value of the testimony"
"but also tarnishes the testimonial trustworthiness of the witness.” So,"
"the said decision applies equally to the case at hand. Therefore, in this"
"case, PW3’s testimonial trustworthiness has been tarnished."
"Apart  from  the  matters  stated  above  with  regard  to  the  evidence  of"
"PW3,  the  history  given  by  PW3  to  the  doctor  who  examined  her  is"
"important in analyzing her evidence. PW15, the doctor, has confirmed"
"the history given by PW3 in his testimony. In the history given by her,"
"she  stated  that  two  persons  entered  the  house  and  opened  the  door."
"Hence, her evidence established the involvement of two persons in the"
"incident. One person among the said two persons is the appellant, she"
"said.  But  very  strangely,  when  PW3  testified  in  the  High  Court  trial,"
"she  only  mentioned  the  appellant's  involvement,  with  no  mention  of"
"the other accused or the involvement of any other person."
