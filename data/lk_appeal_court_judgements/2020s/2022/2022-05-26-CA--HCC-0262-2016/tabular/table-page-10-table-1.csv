"In Don Sunny Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 01 it was held:",""
"","1)  When  a  charge  is  sought  to  be  proved  by  circumstantial  evidence  the"
"","proved 
items  of  circumstantial  evidence  when 
taken 
together  must"
"","irresistibly point towards only inference that the accused committed the"
"","offence. On consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can"
"","be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only."
"2)","If  on  a  consideration  of  the 
items  of  circumstantial  evidence, 
if  an"
"","inference  can  be  drawn  which  is  consistent  with  the  innocence  of  the"
"","accused, 
then  one  cannot  say 
that 
the  charges  have  been  proved"
"","beyond reasonable doubt."
"3)","If  upon  consideration  of  the  proved  items  of  circumstantial  evidence  if"
"","the only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the"
"","offence, then they can be found guilty. The prosecution must prove that"
"","no  one  else  other  than  the  accused  had  the  opportunity  of  committing"
"","the offence. The accused can be found guilty only if the proved items of"
"","circumstantial  evidence  is  consistent  with  their  guilt  and  inconsistent"
"","with their innocence."
