"Abott J. in Rex Vs. Burdett (1820) B & Ald 161 at 162 observed that:"
"“No person is to be required to explain or contradict until enough has been"
"proved  to  warrant  a  reasonable  and  just  conclusion  against  him,  in  the"
"absence  of  explanation  to  contradiction;  but  when  such  proof  has  been"
"given,  and  the  nature  of  the  case  is  such  as  to  admit  of  explanation  or"
"contradiction,  if  the  conclusion  to  it  the  prima  facie  case  tends  to  be  true"
"and the accused offers no explanation or contradiction, can human reason"
"do otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which proof tends.”"
