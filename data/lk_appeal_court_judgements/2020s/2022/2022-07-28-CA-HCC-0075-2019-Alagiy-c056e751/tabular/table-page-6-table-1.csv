"appellant  was 
arrested 
on 
the 
same  day 
for"
"possessing 
illicit 
liquor.  The  said  brother-in-law"
"(DW2)  also  testified  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  at"
"the 
trial.  As  conceded  by 
the 
learned  Deputy"
"Solicitor  General, 
the  prosecution  has 
failed 
to"
"even suggest to the said witness DW2 that he was"
"never arrested by the police that day."
