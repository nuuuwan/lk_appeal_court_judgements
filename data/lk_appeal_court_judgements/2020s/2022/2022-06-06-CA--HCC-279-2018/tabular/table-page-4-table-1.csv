"It was revealed during the trial that the prosecutrix (PW2) in the case was 7 years of age when the"
"alleged act of kidnapping and rape occurred. As per the prosecutrix, she has been playing at the"
"house of the Appellant with his child, when the Appellant has given the prosecutrix Rs. 5/= to buy"
"some beedi for him."
"B
efore she could leave to get the beedi for him, the Appellant had taken her to the kitchen of the"
"house  and  placed  his  male  genitals  in  the  prosecutrix's  mouth  and  thereafter  on  her  vagina."
"According to  the prosecutrix,  she  fainted  after  the  said  act  and the  appellant  carried  her  to  the"
"backyard of the house and left her. After some time, the mother of the victim (PW 1) found the"
"prosecutrix  laying  near  the  lane  of  the  house.  Upon  inquiring,  the  prosecutrix  stated  that  the"
"appellant molested her. When inspecting the prosecutrix's genitals, the mother noticed that there"
"was bleeding. When she inquired, the appellant denied the action. Thereafter, the mother has taken"
"the prosecutrix to the Sammanthurai police station and she was sent to the Ampara hospital."
"T
he  accused  person  has  given  a  dock  statement  where  he  completely  denies  the  events  that"
"occurred. However, he states that the prosecutrix took Rs. 5/- and left but never returned, and later,"
"this allegation has been made. He also indicated that his wife and PW 1 had a brawl and because of"
"that the said allegation was raised against the accused-appellant"
"T
he learned counsel for the respondent submits that the crime is of such a grievous nature that it"
"cannot be taken lightly. The act of the appellant should be condoned by society and the sentence"
"should act as a warning to society. The Court should consider the safety of the victim. It is my view"
"that  the  crime  committed  by  the  appellant  overrides  his  disability.  The  appellant  has  no  prior"
"convictions. The learned Trial Judge in his order pays special attention to the needs of the Appellant"
"and orders that he be subjected to due treatment and special care as he is a handicapped person."
"The sentence of the Appellant has been imposed after the facts have been considered. Since the"
"sentence  falls  within  the  legal  limitations  as  set  by  the  Penal  Code,  there  is  no  illegality  in  the"
"sentence that has been ordered."
