"learned Counsel argued that the Order of the AAT marked P 5 is arbitrary and capricious. When"
"perusing the impugned Order of the AAT marked P 5, it is clear that even though, it has been"
"brought to the notice of the AAT that the NPC has not adduced any reasons for its Order, the"
"AAT had not considered that fact. An administrative authority can only justify its actions"
"if, it is able to show reasons for its decisions. If it fails to give reasons for its decision,"
"a  reasonable  suspicion  would  arise  in  the  minds  of  ordinary  citizens  as  regards  the"
"justifiability of the decision. If a decision maker fails to give reasons for a decision, that"
"decision could be viewed as procedurally flawed."
"In  the  case  of  Regina  v.  Universities  Funding  Council,  Ex  Parte  Institute  of  Dental"
"Surgery2, it was held that when considering whether a disciplinary board should have"
"given  reasons,  the  court  may  find  the  absence  critical  ‘where  the  decision  appears"
"aberrant’.  The  giving  of  reasons  may,  among  other  things  concentrate  the  decision-"
"maker’s mind on the right questions; demonstrate to the recipient that this is so; show"
"that  the  issues  have  been  conscientiously  addressed  and  how  the  result  has  been"
"reached; or alternatively alert the recipient to a justiciable flaw in the process. A body"
"not giving reasons for its decision was not acting inherently unfair, and particularly not"
"where the decision was a collective one. It could be artificial to try to set out reasons"
"made by a body of people."
"In the case of E. M. Wijerama and Others v. A. T. S. Paul3, it was held that even in the"
"absence of a legal requirement, it is desirable that any tribunal against whose decision"
"an appeal is available should, as a general rule, state the reasons for its decision, a course"
"of  action  which  has  the  merit  of  being  both  fair  to  the  petitioner  and  complainant"
"concerned and helpful to the appellate authority."
