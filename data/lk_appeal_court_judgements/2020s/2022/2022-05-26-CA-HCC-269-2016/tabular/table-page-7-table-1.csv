he  appellant  was  assaulted,  which,  however,  does  not  affect  the  credibility  of"
"the defence."
"The  evidence  of  the  appellant’s  sister 
is  that  the  police  had  brought  the"
"appellant  to  his  house,  asked  him  to  remove  the  shorts  and  wear  trousers,"
"handed  over  the  keys  of  the  three-wheeler  to  his  mother,  and  the  police"
"searched  the  entire  house,  standing  un-contradicted  and  un-challenged.    The"
"prosecution  has  not  challenged 
the  above 
facts  by  cross-examining 
the"
"appellant’s sister and has not even suggested that her evidence was not true."
"Other than the heroin, among the things that the police had recovered from the"
"appellant  were  his  driving  licence,  Rs.  2048/-,  his  national  identity  card,  his"
"mobile  phone  with  the  sim  and  a  white  colour  wallet.    All  these  items  are"
"compatible with the position that the appellant was waiting to receive hires in"
"his  three-wheeler.    The  fact  that  the  three-wheeler  was  handed  over  to  his"
"mother,  was not challenged at all by the prosecution.  PW1 never referred to a"
"three-wheeler in his evidence.  The undisputed evidence of the defence proved"
"the following facts:"
"1.  
After  arresting  the  appellant,  he  was  taken  to  his  house  (the  place  of"
"arrest was in dispute)."
"2. 
The police searched the house of the appellant."
"3.  
They have found nothing illegal in the house of the appellant."
"4.  
The three-wheeler was handed over to the mother of the appellant."
"This also proves the fact that he was arrested with the three-wheeler."
"5.  
The appellant was ordered to change his shorts and wear trousers."
