"“The main point for consideration is whether the assessment of super"
"tax was an assessment  under  the  Act,  for  it  is  only  in  that  event   the"
"jurisdiction of the civil court is barred”…..(page 27)"
"“As observed in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 04th Edition"
"page 429 : Statutes which impose pecuniary burden are subject to the"
"rule of strict construction. It is a well settled rule of law that all charges"
"upon the subject must be imposed by clear and unambiguous language,"
"because in some degree they operate as penalties”…..(page 27)"
"“Section   06   of   Act   VIII   of   1917   provided   that   when   in   the   collectors"
"opinion a person is chargeable with super tax a notice shall be served"
"upon  him  calling  upon  him  to  pay   the amount   specified  therein  or  to"
"apply to have the assessment reduced or cancelled.  The only way that"
"an assessee could be said to be charged is by a demand notice issued"
"by the income tax officials, for till then it cannot be argued that he"
"has been charged with the payment of any tax.  But the respondents"
"admittedly received notice of demand only in May 1919, that is after the"
"year 1918-1919 was over and even if he was chargeable with super tax"
"he   ceased   to   be   so   after   the   expiry   of   the   year.   The   demand   notice,"
"therefore, having been issued after the year was over, there was neither"
"payment nor recovery of the super tax within the year 1918-1919”. (page"
