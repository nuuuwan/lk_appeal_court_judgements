"Court in the judgment of S.C. Appeal No. 46/2016 dated 16.12.2021 has said"
"at page 17,"
"“As stated above, the purpose of the amendment made to section 163(5)"
"(a) read with section 106(1)  of the principal Act was not only to grant"
"additional time for an assessor to consider the return of income filed by"
"the taxpayer and make an assessment (if necessary), but also to grant"
"additional   time   for   a   taxpayer   to   prepare   a   return   of   income   in"
"compliance with the said Act…."
"If the amendments made to section 163(5)(a) read with section 106(1) of"
"the   principal   Act   are   interpreted   to   apply   to   the   year   of   assessment"
"2007/2008 with retrospective effect, the taxpayers are deprived of filing"
"income tax returns for such year of assessment within the extended time"
"period, as such extended time period has passed by the time the said"
"amendments came into operation. Thus such an interpretation defeats"
"the purpose of the aforesaid amendment."
"Accordingly   it   is   necessary   to   give   prospective   effect   to   both   of   the"
"aforesaid   amendments   in   order   to   give   effect   to   the   purpose   of"
"legislation”."
