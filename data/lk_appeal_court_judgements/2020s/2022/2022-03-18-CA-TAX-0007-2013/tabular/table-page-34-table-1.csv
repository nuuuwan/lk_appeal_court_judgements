"Even the Tax Appeal Commission has decided this question in the same way. It"
"says at page 09 of its determination,"
"“It is to be noted that in section 17(2)(a)(ii) even though some terms"
"such as “agriculture”, “agro processing”, “non traditional products” and"
"“deemed   export”   are   defined,   the   phrase   “industrial   and   machine   tool"
"manufacturing”   is   not   defined.   Therefore   it   is   necessary   to   look   for   a"
"meaning   to   be   attributed   to   this   phrase   “industrial   and   machine   tool"
"manufacturing”.   It   would   appear   that   in   the   phrase   “industrial   and"
"machine tool manufacturing” the main item referred to is the term “tool”"
"and the words “tool manufacturing” is qualified by the words industrial"
"and   machine.   Therefore   in   this   phrase   “industrial   and   machine   tool"
"manufacturing”   the   term   “tool”   can   be   understood   to   mean   either   an"
"“industrial tool” or a “machine tool””."
