"the assessment. One is whether the applicable date for time bar is the “date of"
"making   the   assessment”   or   the   “date   of   notice   of   assessment”.   The   other   is"
"whether the two year period [unlike in the present  case where the period of"
"time bar is eighteen months, in that case it was two years since the Amending"
"Act No. 19 of 2009 had come into force] end in counting two periods of 365"
"days or on two calendar years."
"In regard to the first question the court decided that the applicable date for the"
"time   bar   is   the   “date   of   making   the   assessment”.   It   said   at   page   08   of   the"
"judgment,"
