"","Khemchand Thaoomal and others, 1923 decided in the Court of the"
"","Judicial Commissioner, Sind."
"(24)","The   court   in   that   case   said,   “The   only   way   that   an   assessee"
"","could be said to be charged is by a demand notice issued by the"
"","income tax officials, for till then it cannot be argued that he has"
"","been charged with the payment of any tax”."
"(25)","In   that   case,   the   tax   payer   could   have   instituted   a   suit   and"
"","recovered the tax paid because there was no “assessment”. There was"
"","no   “assessment”   because   there   was   no   notice,   a   demand,   a   charge"
"","within the limited period. This shows that an “assessment” becomes a"
"","valid “assessment” only when “notice of assessment” is given."
"(26)","The court held that an attempt made by the state to invoke the aid"
"","of a confidential note, within the stipulated time, cannot be tax charged"
"","within   the   year   and   that   the   said   argument   has   no  substance   in  it."
"","Similarly, the argument of the respondent in the present case that the"
"","“assessment” [which is actually an “estimate” in the legal sense] made"
"","without sending notice of assessment can be the assessment fails."
"(27)","The   court   considered   the   absence   of   notice   of   assessment   as   a"
"","patent error of law in the assessment."
"(28)","The plain reading of the term in question in section 17(2) of the"
"","Inland   Revenue   Act
  which  
is  
“industrial
  and   machine  
tool"
"","manufacturing”   shows   that   it   means   “industrial   tool   manufacturing”"
"","and “machine tool manufacturing”."
