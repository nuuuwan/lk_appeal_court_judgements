"day   succeeding   the   day   on   which   it   would   have   been   received   in   the"
"ordinary course by post."
"Hence the appellant argues that the provisions demonstrate the timing when"
"the Notice of Assessment is deemed to be served and it is so because the time"
"of   service   is  material.  The   appellant   questions  that   if   it   were  otherwise   why"
"would the legislature make such specific provisions relating to the deemed time"
"of serving Notice of Assessment. If it were not intended to be adhered to and if"
"the   assessment   was   not   to   be   made   and   served   simultaneously   there   is   no"
"reason for the existence of such provisions."
"This shows that the contention of respondent  that “once” the assessment  is"
"made Notice of Assessment can be served at any time later is not valid."
"Furthermore,   at   paragraph   57   of   the   final   written   submission   the   appellant"
"cites E.Goonaratne, “INCOME TAX IN SRI LANKA”, first edition at page 393,"
"where   he   says  “Making   an   assessment  culminates  in   the   notice   on   the"
"person assessed. An assessment is made when the assessment is sent.”"
"The appellant also cites C.I.T. Bombay vs. Khemchand Ramdas (1938) 6 ITR"
"414,423 (PRIVY Council)  which is cited in Law and Practice of Income Tax by"
"Dinesh Vyas, 9th edition, Volume II at page 1741 where it says,"
