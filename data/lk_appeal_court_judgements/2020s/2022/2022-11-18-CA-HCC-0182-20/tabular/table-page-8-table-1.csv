"says  both  the  torches  were  lit  and  he  identified  the  appellant  because  of  the"
"torchlight. Besides that, it is clear that even the deceased had failed to identify"
"the assailants, The evidence shows that he has questioned as to who assaulted"
"him, after the assailants ran away from the scene."
"It is also necessary to consider the evidence of PW-08 and 09 in the light of the"
"evidence of PW-02 as to the identity. Both the said witnesses have reached the"
"place of the incident soon after it happened. PW-08 had been a former employee"
"of the deceased. He is the person who has helped PW-02 to cover his wounds He"
"has been specific that he questioned PW-02 as to what happened, for which he"
"has not got a reply. PW-09 was another villager lived nearby and also a police"
"officer. PW-02 has failed to reveal to none of them as to who assaulted him and"
"the deceased."
"It is my view that it would be the natural reaction of a person who faced with"
"this kind of a situation to reveal to the persons who arrive to help him as to who"
"was responsible for the injuries caused to him, which has not happened in this"
"incident. This goes on to show that the identification of the appellants and the"
"other accused by PW-02 at a later stage was an afterthought as argued correctly"
"by the learned Counsel for the appellant."
"It is clear that the appellant has maintained an alibi from the very moment of"
"his arrest and throughout the case. He has given evidence on oath and has faced"
"the  test  of  cross-examination,  where  he  has  maintained  the  same  position."
"Although it was not necessary for him to prove his alibi, he has called witnesses"
"in support, to establish that he was elsewhere during the time the witnesses say"
"this incident happened. It has been an admitted fact that there was a wedding"
"function in the village at the alleged time of the incident."
