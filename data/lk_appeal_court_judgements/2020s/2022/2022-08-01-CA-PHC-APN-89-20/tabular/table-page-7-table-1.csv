"Furthermore, it is pertinent to comment on the sum of the bond imposed by the"
"Magistrate.  While  Section  81  of  the  CPC  does  not 
indicate  the  manner  of"
"calculation,  Section  87  may  be  of  some  guidance,  as  both  Sections  are  under"
"Chapter  IV  Prevention  of  Offences  B  –  Security  for  keeping  the  peace  in  other"
"cases and security for good behaviour. Section 87 provides that the amount of"
"every bond shall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the case and"
"shall not be excessive. Hence it is clear that a Magistrate having been satisfied of"
"breach of peace under Section 81 ought to set an amount which is not fanciful"
"or arbitrary with due regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and the"
"party concerned. The provisions of Chapter IV of the CPC should not be used with"
"the object of imprisoning a person who has made himself obnoxious to others, he"
"should be given a chance of obtaining his freedom by tendering security. A point"
"to be considered when setting the bond amount would be the party’s status in"
"life, and the sum demanded should never be such as to absolutely preclude him"
"from being able to furnish the necessary security."

"considered in light of the offence/ act committed and should not be imposed just"
"for the sake of being imposed. The effect of the impinged Magistrate order would"
"result in absurdity where any claim that the petitioner had breached peace within"
"the indefinite period of time would result in the petitioner being liable under a Rs"
"1 million bond. Any default on the part of the petitioner would result in a fine,"
"which, if defaulted, would result in imprisonment."
"At this juncture, it is pertinent to refer to the order delivered by the Magistrate"
"against the 3rd – 6th respondents as well. The said order dated 26.11.2019 carries"
"the  same  fatal  errors  as  the  impugned  order  dated  20.12.2019  i.e.,  failure  to"
"define the bond period, the quantum of the  bond being  exorbitant. Article 138"
"which sets out the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court empowers the Court to"
"correct all errors in fact or  in  law. As per Section  365 of the CPC the Court of"
