"revisionary jurisdiction against any case record of the proceedings of which has"
"been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge. As provided"
"by the Article 145 of the Constitution the Court of Appeal may, ex mero motu or"
"on any application made, call for, inspect and examine any record of any Court"
"of First Instance and in the exercise of its revisionary powers may make any order"
"thereon as the interests of justice may require. Hence, it is incumbent upon this"
"Court  to  use  its  revisionary  powers  against  the  order  of  the  Magistrate  Court"
"dated  26.11.2019  despite  it  not  being  referred  to  in  the  prayer  of  the  instant"
"application."
"Hence,  it  is  the  considered  view  of  this  Court  that  the  Magistrate  Court  order"
"dated  26.11.2019  has  erred  in  law  by  failing  to  comply  with  Section  81  of  the"
"CPC.  In light of such a fatal illegality, it is the view of this Court that the High"
"Court order dated 12.06.2020 erred by dismissing the revision application of the"
"petitioner in limine. Hence, both orders are hereby set aside. This Court further"
"sets aside the order of the Magistrate dated 26.11.2019."
"Application allowed."
