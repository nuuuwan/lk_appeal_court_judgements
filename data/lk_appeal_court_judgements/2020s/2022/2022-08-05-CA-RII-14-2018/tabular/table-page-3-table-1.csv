"It  must  be  noted  that the  inquiry on  the  creation  and  validity  of  the  Last  Will,"
"which was purportedly made on the 22nd of January 2016, is ongoing in the District Court"
"of Gampaha. Thus, it must be stressed that this judgment does not make any finding or"
"determination  as  to  the  validity  of  the  Last  Will  and  Testament  of  the  deceased.  This"
"judgment is solely concerned with determining the lawfulness of the divorce proceedings"
