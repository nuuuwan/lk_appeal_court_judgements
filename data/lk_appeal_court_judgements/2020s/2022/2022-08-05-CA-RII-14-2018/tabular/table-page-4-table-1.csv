"I
n Ittepana v. Hemawathie [1981] 1 SLR 476, his Lordship Sharvananda J. (as he"
"then was) famously held:"
"“
Failure to serve summons is a failure which goes to the root of the jurisdiction of"
"the Court to hear and determine the action against the defendant. It is only by service of"
"summons on the defendant that the Court gets jurisdiction over the defendant. If a"
"defendant is not served with summons or is otherwise notified of the proceedings against"

,
 judgment entered against him in those circumstances is a nullity. And when the"
"Court is made aware of this defect in its jurisdiction, the question of rescinding or"
"otherwise altering the judgment by the Court does not arise since the judgment concerned"
"is a nullity. Where there is no act, there can be no question of the power to revoke or"
"rescind. One cannot alter that which does not exist. The exercise of power to declare such"
"proceedings or judgment a nullity is in fact an original exercise of the power of the Court"
"and not an exercise of the power of revocation or alteration. The proceedings being void,"
"the person affected by them can apply to have them set aside ex debito justitiae in the"
"exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.”"
"A
bdul  Majeed  in  his  treatise  ‘A  Commentary  on  Civil Procedure  Code  and  Civil"
"Law in Sri Lanka’ (Volume 1 Revised Second Edition) at p. 337 states that:"
"“
The purpose of issuing and serving summons on the defendant is to give him"
"notice of the action filed against him and to call upon him to answer the plaint. Until the"
"summons is served on the defendant, the Court cannot exercise its jurisdiction on the"
"defendant. Until summons is served on the defendant he is not expected to know a"
"pending case against him. It is, therefore, imperative to serve summons on the defendant"
"in a case”."
"I
n Leelawathie v. Jayaneris [2001] 2 SLR 231 his Lordship Wigneswaran J. held:"
"“
Unless summons were served on them, all the consequences of default in"
"appearance would not apply to them. There is no question of implying or presuming that"
"the Defendants were aware of the case filed, since statutory provisions apply to service of"
