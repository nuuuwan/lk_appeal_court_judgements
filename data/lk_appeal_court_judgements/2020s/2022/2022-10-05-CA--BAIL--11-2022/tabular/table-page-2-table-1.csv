"Before: Menaka Wijesundera J."
"Neil Iddawala J."
"Counsel: Sabdhika Wellappili and Waijanthi Nandadasa for petitioner."
"Panchali Witharana, SC for the Respondent."
"Argued on: 04.10.2022"
"Decided on: 05.10.2022"
"MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J."
"The instant matter has been filed to obtain bail for  Randombage Dinoj Theshan De"
"Silva, under the Provisions of the Assistance to and Protections of Victims of Crime and"
"Witnesses Act. The Accused has been arrested for the instant matter on 21/12/2021"
"and remanded for a complaint made against him by Ajith Prasnna Senevirathne who"
"was an eye witness in the murder case which had concluded 5 years ago."
"The other Accused in the same case who had been in remand under the instant Act had"
"been enlarged on bail by this Court."
"The state Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents vehemently objected to the"
"application on the basis that the Accused has not completed 01 year in remand. This"
"Court sees  no merit in the submission because the instant Act has been enacted to"
"safe  guard  the  rights  of  victims  and  witnesses,  but  in  the  same  Act  it  is  stated  that"
"matters  coming  under  this  Act  should  be  given  precedence  over  others.    But  if  an"
"accused person is to remain in Prison for an exact period of 01 year when in fact the"
"substantive  matter  has  been  concluded  five  years  ago,  it  is  we  believe  is  a  definite"
"violation of his liberty to freedom."
