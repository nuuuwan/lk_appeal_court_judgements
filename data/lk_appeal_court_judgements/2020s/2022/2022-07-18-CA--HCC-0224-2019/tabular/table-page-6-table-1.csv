"offences,  the  only  available  eye  witness  is  the  victim"
"as  mostly  sexual  offences  are  not  committed 
in"
"public.  One  cannot  expect  to  corroborate  victim’s"
"evidence by the evidence of eye witnesses, apart from"
"other  corroborative  evidence  like  medical  evidence."
"However,  to  act  upon  the  sole  eye  witness,  Court"
"must  be  satisfied  that  her  evidence  is  cogent  and"
"credible.  In  the  instant  case,  as  it  was  mentioned"
"before,  the  PW1’s  clear  evidence  in  Court  was  that"
"the  appellant  had  sexual  intercourse  with  her  only"
"once. However, she has told the Medical Officer that"
"the  PW1  has  had  sexual 
intercourse  with  her  on"
"several 
occasions. 
Therefore, 
that 
affects 
the"
"credibility of this witness in her evidence against the"
"appellant.  Further,  as  admittedly, 
she  has  had"
"intercourse  with  one Wasantha  on  several  occasions"
"during this period, the Medical Officer’s observations"
"cannot  be  taken  as  corroborative  evidence  against"
"the appellant."
