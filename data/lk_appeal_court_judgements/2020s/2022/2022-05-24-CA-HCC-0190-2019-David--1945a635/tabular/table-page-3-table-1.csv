"buy 
some  medicine.  When 
the  wife  was 
returning 
to 
the"
"motorcycle  from  the  pharmacy,  two  or  three  persons  have  come"
"and 
asked 
them  what 
they  were 
doing.  Upon 
identifying"
"themselves  as  police  officers  and  stating 
that 
they  wanted 
to"
"search them on suspicion, they were taken to the police post. Upon"
"search,  nothing  suspicious  has  been  found  on  them.  The  police"
"have then released the wife and held back the appellant stating that"
"they  suspect  him.  Subsequently,  upon  taking  him  to  the  Modara"
"Police Station they have filed this case against him."
"4.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted  that  the  learned"
"High  Court  Judge  has 
imposed  an  additional  burden  on 
the"
"appellant  that  is  not  obliged  by  law.  It  is  the  contention  of  the"
"learned  Counsel  that  no  burden  of  proof  can  be  placed  on  the"
"appellant and therefore that the appellant was denied of a fair trial."
"In that the learned Counsel submitted that the learned trial Judge"
"in his judgment at pages 24, 27 and 29 (pages 208, 211 and 213 of"
"the brief) has commented on the failure of the appellant to call his"
"wife as a witness whereby the learned trial Judge has clearly erred."
"The  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  further  submitted  that  the"
"learned trial Judge in his judgment has said that the defence taken"
"by 
the  accused 
in  his  dock  statement  was  never  put 
to 
the"
"witnesses  for  the  prosecution  in  cross  examination.  Whereas,  the"
"defence  Counsel  at  the  trial  has  clearly  put  their  defence  to  the"
"witnesses.  The  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  contended  that  the"
"above  mentioned  comments  made  by 
the 
learned  High  Court"
"Judge in his judgment should not be taken in isolation, however,"
"the  evidence  of  the  case  and  the  judgment  of  the  learned  trial"
"Judge have to be considered in totality. When it is taken in totality,"
"it  is  the  submission  of  the  Senior  State  Counsel  that  no  other"
"conclusion  could  have  been  arrived  at  by  the  learned  trial  Judge"
"other than to convict the appellant."
"5.  While  conceding  that  the  appellant  has  suggested  his  defence  to"
"the  witnesses,  the  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  submitted  that  a"
"mere suggestion  of  the  defence  that  is  denied  would  not  create a"
"reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution.  In his judgment"
"at  page  24  (page  208  of  the  brief)  the  learned  trial  Judge  has"
"commented;"
