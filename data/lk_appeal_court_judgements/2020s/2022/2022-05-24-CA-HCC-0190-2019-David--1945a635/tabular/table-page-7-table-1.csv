"4. Hence,  it  is  clear  that  placing  additional  burden  of  proof  to  the"
"appellant as mentioned above has prejudiced the substantial rights"
"of the accused and has occasioned a failure of justice. Therefore,"
"the  conviction  of  the  appellant  should  not  be  upheld.  As  I  have"
"mentioned  before  in  this  judgment,  the  learned  trial  Judge  has"
"been  seriously  misdirected  on  the  facts  as  well  when  he  rejected"
"the defence version based on among other things, that the defence"
"was not  put to the prosecution witnesses. Thus, I find that this  is"
"not  a  fit  case  to  be  sent for  retrial.  Therefore,  the  conviction  and"
"the sentence imposed on the appellant by the learned High Court"
"Judge are set aside. The accused is acquitted of the charges."
