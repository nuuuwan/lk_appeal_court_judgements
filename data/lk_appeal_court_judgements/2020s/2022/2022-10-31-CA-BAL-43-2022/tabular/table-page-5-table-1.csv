"As detailed above, the suspect has been incarcerated for nearly three"
"years and is yet to be served with an indictment, with no indication of"
"the  commencement  of  a  trial.  Hence,  the  petitioner  has  fulfilled  the"
"the  PTA, 
‘legislative  prescription’  envisioned  by  Section  15B  of"
"introduced by Amendment Act, No. 12 of 2022. As such, this Court is"
"vested  with  the  discretion  to  consider  the  suspect’s  bail  application"
"and make an order. At this juncture, it is pertinent to note that the"
"State Counsel has not objected to the granting of bail to the suspect."
"In considering all the facts detailed above, it appears to this Court that"
"the respondents have held the suspect in incarceration for a prolonged"
"time  under  the  PTA,  without  building  up  a  rational  basis  and  any"
"prospect  of  a  trial.  The  Court  also  notes  the  inordinate  delay  in  the"
"process of administering justice, and the aggrieved state of the suspect"
"owing to such shortcomings."

law  does  not  construe  the"
"incarceration  of  a  suspect  pending 
investigation  as  amounting 
to"
"punishment, it does indeed restrict the inherent rights and freedoms of"
"the suspect,  which  are ensured by the Constitution. Hence,  a  suspect"
"has the right to be brought to trial without unreasonable and inordinate"
"delay,  even  in  the  context  of  a  special  circumstance  envisioned  under"
"the PTA. If adequate material to justify the continued incarceration of a"
"suspect is absent, such person must be discharged at the first available"
"opportunity”."
