onclusion  of  the  case.  Therefore,  whether  the  art  of  narrating  the  events  in"
"chronological order or otherwise is irrelevant."
"The last point argued was that there was a sudden fight or a grave and sudden"
"provocation.    There was  no  evidence  to show  that  such  an  incident  happened"
"at  the  scene.    The  defence  suggested  to  PW1  that  her  father  had  caused"
"injuries to the wife and the sister of the first accused. A careful perusal of the"
"evidence  of  PW1  revealed  that  she  never  admitted  that  there  was  a  fight.  No"
"such  incident  was  reported  to  the  police.  As  per  the  police  officers  who  gave"
"evidence, there had not been such an incident reported to the police. Even the"
"dock statement of the appellants does not reveal that there was a fight."
"In the above circumstances, we see no reason to interfere with the judgment of"
"the  learned  High  Court  Judge.  We  affirm  the  conviction  and  the  sentence"
"imposed  upon  the  appellants.    Therefore,  the  appeal  of  the  appellants  are"
"dismissed."
