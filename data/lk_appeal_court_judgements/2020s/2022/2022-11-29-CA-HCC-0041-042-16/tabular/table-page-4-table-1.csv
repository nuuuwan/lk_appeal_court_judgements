nives in the hands of the first accused but did not see what was in the hands"
"of  the  second  appellant.    The  deceased  was  not  in  a  position  to  speak;  all  he"
"could  say  was  “daughter”.    PW1  raised  cries  when  she  saw  blood  all  over  the"
"body  of  the  deceased.    PW1  testified  that  she  had  known  the  appellants  for"
"seven  years  before 
the 
incident  happened,  as 
they 
lived 
in 
the 
same"
"neighborhood."
"The conviction of the appellant for the murder revolves around the evidence of"
"PW1, the sole eyewitness."
"Both  appellants  submitted  that  acting  on  the  sole  eyewitness’s  evidence  was"
"not  safe.  The  appellants  contended 
that 
the  evidence  of  PW1  was  not"
"trustworthy  and  not  corroborated.  This  is  the  main  contention  against  the"
"conviction."
"The 
learned 
  Senior  Deputy  Solicitor  General 
for  the  respondent  drawing"
"attention  to  section  134  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  and  a  well-recognized"
"principle 
is  that  the  evidence  has  to  be  weighed  and  not  counted. 
  It 
is"
"contended that the evidence of PW1 is cogent and trustworthy."
"Further,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  pointed  out  that  the  Counsel"
"who appeared for the first appellant at the trial sought to draw attention to an"
"omission in the evidence of PW1.  (On page 83)"
"The statement of PW1 was recorded by the police on the 14th of June 2006, at"
"2.15  a.m. 
  The  statement  of  PW1  was  recorded  within 
four  hours  of  the"
"incident. There was no omission or contradiction marked against the evidence"
"led  by  PW1.  The 
learned  High  Court  Judge  observed  that 
it  was  not  an"
"omission.  After  a  careful  perusal,  I  found  that,  what  was  sought  to  draw"
"attention  as  an  omission,  was  actually  not  an  omission.    Counsel  for  the"
"second  appellant  submitted  that  PW1  had  not  stated  to  the  police  that  the"
"second    accused  had  cut  her  father.    However,  the  following  portion  is  also"
