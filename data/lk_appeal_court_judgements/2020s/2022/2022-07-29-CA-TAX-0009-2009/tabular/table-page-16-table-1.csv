"[40] The assessment No. 9523168 relates to the tax in dispute which has been"
"assessed  by  the Assessor  in terms  of  the  provisions  of the  Inland  Revenue"
"Act, No. 28 of 1979 and the Appellant appealed against the said assessment"
"to the Respondent. Prior to any determination to be made by the Respondent,"
"the  Inland Revenue (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 2003 came into force"
"on  17.03.2003.  By  virtue  of  section  4  (3)  of    the  Inland  Revenue  (Special"
"provisions) Act, No. 10 of 2003, the Assessor was obliged to accept the tax"
"specified by the Appellant in the return as being correct and reflecting the final"
"tax liability of that person in respect of such period, 98/99."
"[
41]  There  is  nothing  to  indicate  in  the  Inland  Revenue  (Special  Provisions)"
"Act, No. 10 of 2003 that the scope of section 4 (3) is limited to, assessments"
"where there is no appeal filed or have been withdrawn by any Appellant due"
"to  the  Inland  Revenue  (Special  Provisions)  Act,  No.  10  of  2003.  As  it  was"
"noted, the Inland Revenue (Regulation of Amnesty) Act, No. 10 of 2004 clearly"
"empowered 
the  Commissioner  General  or  any  other  Authority 
to 
issue"
"assessments where any tax, levy or penalty, (including any penalty in respect"
"of any offence) forfeiture or fine has been discharged in terms of  the Inland"
"Revenue (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 2003, when its schedule includes"
"the Inland Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979. For those reasons, I hold that there"
"is no merit in the argument that the assessments contemplated by section 4"
"(2) (b) of the Inland Revenue (Regulation of Amnesty) Act, No. 10 of 2004  are"
"those assessments where there has been no appeal filed or the appeal filed"
"has been withdrawn as claimed by the Appellant."
"[
42]  Accordingly, 
I 
hold 
that 
the  Senior  Assessor 
representing 
the"
"Commissioner  General 
 
is  entitled  to 
issue 
the  assessment  bearing  No."
"8206103  (A7) in terms of section 4 (2) (b) of the Inland Revenue (Regulation"
"of Amnesty) Act, No. 10 of 2004  when any tax, levy or penalty included in the"
"assessment No. 9523168 (A2), had been discharged in terms of section 4 (3)"
"of the Inland Revenue (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 2003."
"[
43]  The  Appellant  further  contended  that  Inland  Revenue  (Regulation  of"
"Amnesty) Act, No. 10 of 2004 cannot apply to the Appellant as the Appellant"
"did  not  make  any  application  seeking  amnesty  under  the  Inland  Revenue"
"(Special  Provisions)  Act,  No.  10  of  2003  in  respect  of  non-payment  or  non-"
"disclosure  of  liability  by  making  a  statutory  declaration for the purpose.  The"
"Appellant relies on section 6(3) of the Interpretation Ordinance, No. 21 of 1901"
"(as  amended)  and  argues 
that 
it  was  able 
to  acquire  a  right  within 
the"
"contemplation of section 6 (3) as the Appellant  did not seek an amnesty by"
"making  a  declaration  under  section  2  of 
the 
Inland  Revenue
