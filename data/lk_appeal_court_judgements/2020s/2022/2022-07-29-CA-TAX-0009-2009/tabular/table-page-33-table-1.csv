"1998/1999. It is crystal clear that in terms of the agreement, the transfer of 28"
"residential  units 
in 
the  year  1998/1999 
in 
lieu  of 
redemption  of  shares"
"extinguished any further claim to be made by the Appellant against Keangnam"
"in  respect  of  the  said  preference  shares  or  dividends  accumulated  thereon."
"Accordingly, the intention between the parties was that Keangnam will redeem"
"cumulative preference shares and in lieu of redemption of preference shares,"
"Keangnam will transfer the 28 residential units to the Appellant and upon the"
"said transfer, the right of the Appellant to any claim against Keangnam will be"
"extinguished."
"[90] The transfer of 28 residential units took place in the year 1998/1999.  The"
"Appellant carried out improvements to the same and the  market value of the"
"said units was estimated at US$ 585 Million when the units were handed over"
"to the Appellant by keangnam in terms of the agreement. The capital  gain made"
"by the Appellant as per the Assessorâ€™s assessment (A2) in terms of the Inland"
"Revenue  Act,  No.  28  of  1979  was  Rs.  503  Million  (Rs.  585,000,000-Rs."
"82,000,000)."
"[91] It is manifest that the parties to the agreement intended to carry out the"
"transaction irrespective of whether there are legal obstacles set out clause 12"
"of the agreement, and expressly agreed that the consideration for the transfer"
"of 28 residential units shall be satisfied by the redemption  proceeds of the said"
"preference shares and accumulated dividends.  The Appellant who took over"
"possession  of  28 
residential  units 
in 
the  year  1998/1999,  carried  out"
"improvements,  relinquished  all  further  claims  set  out  in  the  agreement  and"
"awaited  deeds  of 
transfer  at  a 
later  date.  Having  acted 
in 
terms  of 
the"
"agreement  and  made  a  capital  gain  of  Rs.  503  Million  in  relation  of  the  said"
"residential  units, 
the  Appellant  now  relies  on  non-fulfillment  of 
formalities"
"stipulated in section 52 (1) of the Companies Act, No. 17 of 1982 by Keagnnam"
"to avoid tax liability in respect of capital gain made by the Appellant under the"
"provisions of the Inland Revenue, Act, No. 28 of 1979."
"[92] Even if it is assumed that keangnam failed to formally cancelled the shares"
"upon 
transferring  28  residential  units 
to 
the  Appellant  as  claimed  by 
the"
"Appellant, or that Keangnam did not make a profit at that point, the Appellant"
"who  made  a  capital  gain  of  503  Million  in  the  year  1998/1999  cannot  be"
"permitted to benefit from any breach of the provisions of the Companies Act,"
"No.  17  of  1982  by  Keangnam.  In  my  view,  the  charging  section  and  the"
"computation  provisions  of  a  tax  statute  are  inextricably  connected  and  the"
"charging section of a tax statute constitutes an integrated part of the Income"
"Tax Statute. The provisions of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979 in my"
"view cannot be superseded by the provisions of the Companies Act, No. 17 of"
"1982."
