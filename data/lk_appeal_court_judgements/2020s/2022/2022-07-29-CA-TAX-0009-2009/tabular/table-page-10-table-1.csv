"","The enactment of the Inland Revenue (Regulation of Amnesty) Act, No. 10"
"","of 2004 has empowered the Assessor to raise assessment and the Board"
"","to determine the Appeal. We find no merit in this objection by the appellant,"
"","particularly as section 2 (2) of the Inland Revenue (Regulation of Amnesty)"
"","Act.  No.  10  of  2004  expressly  provides  the  continuation  of  the  liability"
"","irrespective of any right acquired under the Amnesty Act."
"","As  such,  the  Board  overrules  the  preliminary  issues  and  proceeds  to"
"","determine the appeal on the substantive issues based on the submissions"
"","of the parties”."
"[","22] It is clearly seen that even though the BOR has not specifically referred to"
"","the assessment bearing No. 8206103 (A7) in its determination, it has overruled"
"","the preliminary objection raised by the Appellant that the Assessor is not legally"
"","empowered to raise a fresh assessment under and in terms of section 4 (4) of"
"","the Inland Revenue (Regulation of Amnesty) Act. No. 10 of 2004. The only fresh"
"assessment","referred 
to  by 
the  BOR 
in 
its  determination 
relates 
to 
the"
"","assessment bearing No. 8206103 (A7) in respect of which the appeal was filed"
"","by the Appellant to the BOR."
"[","23] The BOR then proceeded to consider the substantive issue raised by the"
"","Appellant in respect of the assessment No. 8206103 (A7)  and dismissed the"
"","appeal  filed  in  respect  of  the  assessment  bearing  No.  8206103  (A7).  It  is"
"","relevant to note that the substantive issue that was decided by the Respondent"
"","and the BOR related to the liability of the Appellant to pay capital gains tax in a"
"","sum of Rs. 503,000,000/- under section 7 (1) (d) of the Inland Revenue Act, No."
"","28 of 1979 (as amended)."
"[","24] There is nothing in the determination made by the BOR to indicate that the"
"","BOR considered the appeal purely on the basis of the assessment bearing No."
"","9523168  (A2)  when  the  determination  clearly  refers to  the fresh  assessment"
