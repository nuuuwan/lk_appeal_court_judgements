"outstanding.  The  notice  of  assessment  (A2)  refers 
to 
the  penalty  of  Rs."
"215,003,864  while  the  notice  of  assessment  (A7)  refers  to  a  penalty  of  Rs."
"175,723,064."
"[
65] The Appellant challenged the imposition of penalty for the late payment of"
"taxes on the basis that in terms of the agreement with the Government of Sri"
"Lanka,  the  obligation 
to  pay 
taxes  and 
the  penalty  must  be  paid  by 
the"
"Government of Sri Lanka (Vide- question of law No. 23). The Appellant did not,"
"however, challenge the method of calculation of penalty referred to in the notice"
"of assessment in question."
"[
66] It is relevant to note that the assessment No. 8206103 (A7) in respect of"
"the capital gain made by the Appellant had been reissued under section 4 (2)"
"(b) of the Inland Revenue (Regulation of Amnesty) Act, No. 10 of 2004 on the"
"basis  of  the  same  reasons  that  had  been  stated  and  communicated  by  the"
"Assessor 
to 
the  Appellant 
in  his  assessment  No.  9523168 
(A2). 
  The"
"communications marked A5 and A6 clearly referred to (i) the same TIN number"
"(10408536);  (ii)    the  assessment  No.  9523168  (A2)  issued  for  the  year  of"
"assessment  1998/1999;    (iii)  the  fact  that  the  said  assessment  No.  9523168"
"was  discharged  in  terms  of  section  4  (3)  of  the  Inland  Revenue  (Special"
"Provisions)  Act,  No.  10  of  2003;  and  (iv)    the  fact  that  the  said  discharged"
"assessment will be reissued in terms of the provisions of the Inland Revenue"
"(Regulation of Amnesty) Act, No. 10 of 2004."
"[
67] As it was noted, the details of the two assessments A2 and A7 are almost"
"identical  except  the  differences  between  the  two  assessments  due  to  the"
"reduction in the tax on dividends which ultimately reduced the tax payable by"
"the Appellant. It is clear that the Assessorâ€™s reasons given for the assessment"
"No. 9523168 (A2) in respect of capital gain made by the Appellant for the year"
"of assessment 1998/1999, are the same reasons that applied to the reissued"
"assessment  No.  8206103  made  by 
the  Assessor 
for 
the  same  year  of"
"assessment  1998/1999 
in 
terms  of 
the  provisions  of  the 
Inland  Revenue"
"(Regulation of Amnesty) Act, No. 10 of 2004."
"[
68] For those reasons, I hold that the reasons stated and communicated to the"
"Appellant by letter dated 06.12.2006 for rejecting the return of income of the"
"Appellant in respect of the capital gain made by the Appellant  for the year of"
"assessment  1998/1999  continue  to  be  operative,  and  apply  to  the  reissued"
"assessment made by operation of law in respect of the same capital gain and"
"the same year of assessment. For those reasons, the decision in Fernando v"
"Ismail (supra) can be distinguished from the facts of the present case as the"
"reasons for  rejecting  the  return  of  income  have  been  clearly  provided  by  the"
"Assessor, and communicated in writing to the Appellant as required by law. For"
"those reasons, I hold that the question of law No.15 must be answered in favour"
"of the Respondent."
