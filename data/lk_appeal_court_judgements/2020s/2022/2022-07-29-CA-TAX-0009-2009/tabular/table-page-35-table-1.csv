"consideration 
for 
the 
transfer  of  28  residential  units  was  satisfied  by 
the"
"redemption  of  proceeds  of  the  said  preference  shares  and  the  accumulated"
"dividends and thus, the parties intended the redemption to take place by the"
"transfer of 28 residential units to the Appellant by keangnam. In my view, the"
"preference 
share 
itself 
stood 
extinguished 
by 
redemption  when 
the"
"consideration  for  the  transfer  of  28  residential  units  was  satisfied  from  the"
"redemption proceeds of the share preference and the accumulated dividends,"
"where 
the  Appellant  relinquished  all 
its  right 
to  any  further  claim  against"
"Keangnam."
"[96] I am of the view that the BOR has come to a right a decision in this case."
"The transfer of 28 residential units, acquisition of possession and improvements"
"made by the Appellant at a cost of 44,104,349 million and the agreement not to"
"claim  any 
further  claim  against 
the  Company  will 
  squarely  constitute  a"
"redemption of preference shares by keangnam within the meaning of section 7"
"(1) (d) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979 (as amended)."
"[97] With regard to the year of chargeability under the provisions of the Inland"
"Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979, it is the year of effective transfer of 28 residential"
"units to the Appellant with the right to improve such units that is relevant. Capital"
"gains are assessable as income of the year in which the redemption took place"
"by the transfer of 28 residential units to the Appellant, even though the shares"
"were formerly cancelled under the provisions of the Companies Act, No. 17 of"
"1982 in the subsequent year."
"[98] To attract the liability to tax under Section 7(1)(d), it is sufficient if, in the"
"accounting year (1998/99), capital gain was made by the Appellant when the"
"Appellant who had a right to take over possession of 28 residential shares, in"
"lieu of redemption of shares in terms of the agreement and made improvements"
"in the year 1998/1999 and relinquished all its rights against Keangnam on the"
"understanding that the cancellation of shares and the formal execution of deeds"
"will be made in the subsequent years."
"[99] In other words, the Appellant had a right to take over 28 residential units,"
"carry  out  improvement  in  the  relevant  accounting  year  (1998/1999)  in  lieu  of"
"redemption  of  preference  shares,  and  in  my  view  that  would  be  sufficient  to"
"attract tax liability on capital gains under Section 7(1)(d) of the Inland Revenue"
"Act, No. 28 of 1979, irrespective whether the formal cancellation of shares was"
"effected by Keangnam, the formal transfer of deeds was executed and book"
"entries were made in the subsequent accounting year."
"[100] The question whether or not, the other party to the agreement, Keangham"
"violated  section  52  (1)  of  the  Companies  Act,  No.  17  of  1982  relating  to  the"
"redemption of shares by not making the cancellation of shares in the same year"
"of  assessment  and  notification  of  the  same  to  the  Registrar  of  Companies,"
"cannot be raised as an excuse to avoid tax liability of the Appellant in respect"
"of  capital  gain  made  by  the  Appellant  in  the  year  1998/1999  under  section"
"7(1)(d) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979."
