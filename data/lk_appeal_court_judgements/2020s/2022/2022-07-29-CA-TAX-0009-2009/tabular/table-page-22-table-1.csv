"","[57] In Fernando v. Ismail (supra), it was held that the duty to give reasons is"
"a  mandatory  requirement  and","the 
failure 
to  do  so  would  result 
in 
the"

"","“More particularly, the communication of the reason at the relevant time is"
"","the indication of its compliance. The new procedure would also have the"
"","effect of fixing the Assessor to a definite position and not to give him the"
"","latitude to chop and change thereafter. It was therefore essential that an"
"","Assessor who rejects a return should state his reasons and communicate"
"","them. His reasons must be communicated at or about the time he sends"
"","his assessment on an estimated income. Any late communication would"
"","defeat the remedial action intended by the amendment”."
"","[58] It is settled law that where the Assessor does not accept the return made"
"","by the assessee and makes an assessment, he shall state his reasons and"
"","communicate his reasons to the assessee, and the failure to comply with this"
"","mandatory requirement will result in the assessment being devoid of any legal"
"","effect. As it was noted, the Appellant furnished its return of income for the year"
"","of assessment 1998/1999 and that the return of income in respect of capital"
"","gain was rejected by the Assessor by letter dated 06.12.2000 (A1). By the said"
"","letter marked A1, the Assessor explicitly  stated the following reasons for the"
"","rejection of return of income furnished by the Appellant in respect of the capital"
"","gain for the year of assessment 1998/1999, and communicated those reasons"
"to the Appellant:",""
"","1.  Capital  gain  amounting  to  Rs.  503,000,000/-  arisen  on  redemption  of"
"","shares has not been declared and income and taxes have not been paid;"
"","2.  Shares  held  by  the  Appellant  in  Keangnam  have  been  redeemed  by"
"","Keangnam  at  a  value  of  Rs.  28  Million  by  way  of  giving  28  residential"
"","apartments (Units) and the Appellant has obtained possession  of the said"
