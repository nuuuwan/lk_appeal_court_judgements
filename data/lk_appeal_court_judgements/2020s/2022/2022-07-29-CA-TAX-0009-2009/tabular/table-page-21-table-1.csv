"had  been  discharged  by  section  4 
(3)  of 
the 
Inland  Revenue 
(Special"
"Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 2003, notwithstanding the fact that the period for"
"the making of the same has elapsed."
"[
53] As it was noted, it is manifest that the assessment was re-issued in terms"
"of section 4 (2) (b) in conformity with the scheme, purpose, intent and meaning"
"of  the  Inland  Revenue  (Regulation  of  Amnesty)  Act,  No.  10  of  2004  and"
"therefore, the mere reference to a wrong section is not fatal to the validity of the"
"assessment  (A7).  The  Appellant  has  completely  disregarded  the  fact  that"
"section 4 (2) (b) of the Inland Revenue (Regulation of Amnesty) Act, No. 10 of"
"2004 expressly empowered the Commissioner General or any other Authority"
"to  issue  assessments  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  period  for  the"
"making of the same has elapsed” ."
"[
54]  It  is  relevant  to  note  that  the  assessment  No.  8206103  was  issued  on"
"26.03.2006  (A7)  and  the  appeal  dated  25.04.2006  was  acknowledged  on"
"27.04.2006 by letter dated on 27.04.2006 (A8). Section 136 (13) of the Inland"
"Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 as amended by the Inland Revenue (Amendment)"
"Act, No. 37 of 2003 provides that “…an appeal received by the Commissioner"
"General on  or  after  April  1,  2003  shall  be  determined  by  the  Commissioner-"
"General within two years from the date of receipt of such appeal”."
"[
55]  Accordingly,  the  appeal  had  to  be  determined  by  the  Respondent  on  or"
"before 28.04.2008. The Respondent determined the appeal on 21.04.2008 as"
"indicated 
in 
the 
letter  dated  21.04.2008,  and 
the  said  determination  was"
"communicated to the Appellant by letter dated 22.04.2008 (Vide- BOR file). For"
"those reasons,  I hold that the appeal filed against the assessment bearing No."
"8206103 (A7) is not time barred by operation of law and therefore, questions of"
"law No.s 13 and 14 should be answered in favour of the Respondent."
