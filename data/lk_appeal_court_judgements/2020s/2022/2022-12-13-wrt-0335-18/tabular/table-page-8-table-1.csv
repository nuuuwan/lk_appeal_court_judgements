"The 3rd, 4th, 5th & 6th Respondents have failed to demonstrate why the UDA or the CMC should"
"be made parties to this case. Especially in view of the submission made by the Petitioner that"
"they are only seeking a writ against the 1st and 2nd Respondent for the execution of P12 and"
"P13.  The  said  orders  had  not  been  given  by  the  parties,  the  Respondents  are  arguing  to  be"
"necessary parties. The 3rd 5th and 6th Respondent had  failed to demonstrate to this Court the"
"necessity  to  have  the  said  disclosed  parties  as  Respondent  to  this  action.  In  our  view,  this"
"objection on necessary parties has to fail. It is also the view of this Court that, this is a failed"
"attempt by the 3rd 5th, and 6th Respondent to prolong this case."
