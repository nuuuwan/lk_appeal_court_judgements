"evinced  by  the  list  of  tools  utilised,  and  the  absence  of  any  other  plausible"
"reason  for  the  excavation  conducted  point  to  the  fact  that  the  respondent  has"
"excavated  for  the  sole  purpose  of  discovering  antiquities  near  or  around  the"
"ancient 
tank.  Being  an  employee  of 
the  Department  of  Archaeology, 
the"
"respondent cannot plead ignorance or otherwise contend that he participated in"
"an offence without knowledge. The respondent carries a duty of care to ensure"
"that areas with a strong likelihood of carrying antiquities are protected. Thus, it"
"is the considered view of this Court that the purpose for which the respondent"
"has conducted the excavation is for the discovery of antiquities."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  misdirected  himself  by  insisting  on  the"
"existence of antiquities when examining the offences, the respondent has been"
"charged  with.  It  appears  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  misdirected"
"himself  as  to  the  applicable  law  by  insisting  on  the  existence  of  antiquities,"
"weighed in the acquiescence of the State Counsel representing the petitioner to"
"invoke  the  revisionary  jurisdiction.  This  is  a  grave  irregularity  that  cannot  be"
"condoned. The revisionary jurisdiction cannot be invoked by consent, and it can"
"only be permitted in the event there is illegality, impropriety or irregularity in an"
"order  which  has  caused  a  miscarriage  of  justice.  Hence,  it  is  the  duty  of  the"
"judge acting in revision to examine the facts and law before him, independent of"
"the consent or otherwise of the opposing party."
"At  this  juncture,  it  is  pertinent  to  comment  on  the  role  played  by  the  State"
"Counsel  representing  the  petitioner  before  the  High  Court.  The  State  Counsel"
"has  consented  to  the  revision  application;  beyond  that,  the  Case  Brief  records"
"no  other  submissions  supporting  such  consent.  However,  proceedings  dated"
"09.09.2015  notes  a  brief  submission  by  a  State  Counsel  for  the  petitioner"
"objecting  to  the  revision  application,  noting  that  as  the  respondent 
is  an"
"employer  of  the  Department  of  Archaeology,  he  carries  a  higher  standard  of"
"duty  under  the  Ordinance  to  abide  by  the  law  as  opposed  to  a  layperson."
"However,  this 
line  of  argument  has  drastically  changed  as  evinced  by  the"
"impugned order whereby the learned High Court judge has stated that the State"
"Counsel  has  consented  to  the  revision  application.  A  State  Counsel  cannot"
