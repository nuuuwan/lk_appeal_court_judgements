"Section 15(1)(a) of the Ordinance (as amended by Increase of Fines Act No 12 of"
"2005) provides for offences relating to the discovery of antiquities and stipulates"
"that “every person who excavates in contravention of the provisions of Section 6;"
"shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction after summary trial before a"
"Magistrate  be 
liable 
to  a 
fine  not 
less 
than 
fifty 
thousand  rupees  and  not"
"exceeding  two  hundred  and  fifty  thousand  rupees  or  to  imprisonment  of  either"
"description for a term not exceeding one year..” A plain reading of the applicable"
"law  reveals  that  there  is  no  requirement  for  the  existence  of  antiquities  as  an"
"element  of  the  offence  contained  in  Section  6  read  with  Section  15(1)(a)  of  the"
"Ordinance. One cannot read into the law an element that the legislature did not"
"envision.  The actus  reus stipulated  in  Section  6  is  an  unlicensed  excavation,"
"which  has  been  undisputed 
in  the 
‘the 
instant  case,  and  the mens  rea is"
"purpose of  discovering antiquities’—the instant application pivots on  the latter"
"element.  In  the  respondent’s  written  submissions,  it  is  averred  that  as  the"
"excavated  site  is  a  ‘non-archaeological  site’,  the  intention  of  the  respondent  to"
"excavate 
cannot  mature 
into  a  purpose  of  discovering  antiquities 
(Vide"
"Paragraph  2).  However,  the  respondent  in  his  written  submissions  does  not"
"provide  any  indication  as  to  why  the  respondent  deemed  the  site  to  be  ‘non-"
"archaeological’. This assessment seems to be  based on the excavation findings"
"after the fact. The unambiguous language utilised by the legislature in framing"
"Section  6  of  the  Ordinance  manifests  that  the  existence  of  antiquities  or  the"
"lack thereof is immaterial to constitute an offence under the Ordinance. Section"
