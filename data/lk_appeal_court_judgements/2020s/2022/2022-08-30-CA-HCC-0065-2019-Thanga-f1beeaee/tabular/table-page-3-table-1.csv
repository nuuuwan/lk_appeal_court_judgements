"","the day of the incident, the appellant had gone and"
"","handed  over 
the  nine  months  old  child 
to  his"
"","mother  stating 
that 
the

"","ailment. 
The 
evidence 
also 
revealed 
that 
the"
"","appellant  had  gone  to  his  brother-in-lawâ€™s  house"
"","and tried to drink poison. The body of the deceased"
"","was  found  lying  dead  inside  the  house  (line  room)."
"","The  autopsy  has  confirmed  a  blunt  trauma  to  the"
"","head  as  well  as  numerous  cut

"","hair  that  was  found  in  the  razor  knife  which  was"

the"
"","appellant  in  terms  of  section  27  of  the  Evidence"
"","Ordinance tallied with the hair samples taken from"

"3.","The  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  has  urged"
"","three 
grounds 
of 
appeal 
in 
his 
written"
"","submissions.  However,  at 
the  hearing 
of 
this"
"","appeal,  the  learned  Counsel  did  not  pursue  the"
"","first 
two  grounds  of  appeal  but  only 
the 
third"
"","ground of appeal which was the alternative ground"
"","of appeal."
"4.","Alternative ground of appeal"
"","The  appellant  relies  on  the  exception  4  to  section"
"","294 of the Penal Code."

"","appellant  that  as  the  evidence  revealed  that  the"
"","appellant  and 
the  deceased  has  had  constant"
"","quarrels, the appellant is entitled to get the benefit"
"","from exception 4 to section 294 of the Penal Code."
"","The 
learned  Counsel 
further 
submitted 
that,"
"","although  the  appellant  did  not  suggest  the  above"
"","defence  in  his  unsworn  statement  from  the  dock,"
"","the  learned  trial  Judge  ought  to  have  considered"
"","the same based on the evidence of the case."
