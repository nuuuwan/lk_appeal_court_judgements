"the later cannot be ‘wiped out’. Saleem Marsoof J. (as he was then P/CA) referring to a"
"judgement of Wanasundera J. held as follows;"
"“As  Wanasundera  J.  observed 
in  The Public Service United Nurses Union v"
"Montague Jayewickrema, Minister of Public Administration and Others (S.C."
"Application No. 4/87 decided on 29.04.1988) at 230 - “..........when existing general"
"rules are sought to be altered, this too must be done in the same manner and following the"
"identical procedures as for their formulation, namely, by enacting an ending rule.”"
"The  approval  contained  in  1R18  does  not  constitute  rules,  regulations  and  procedures  of"
"general  application  which  could  replace  the  pre-existing  rules,  regulations  and  procedures"
"including the Establishments Code. In the circumstances, the court holds that 1R18 is not in"
"any manner sanctioned by Article 61B of the Constitution. The court is of the opinion that"
"the Public Service Commission has not made any contrary provisions which will discontinue"
"the application of the pre-existing rules, regulations and procedures including the provision of"
"the manual of transfer and Chapter III of the Establishments Code.”"
"In the circumstances, I am of the view that filling the vacancies in the Deputy Medical"
"Administrative Grade otherwise than in terms of and/or in contravention of the Service"
"Minute as amended would be ultra vires, arbitrary and unreasonable."
"It is observed as per the ‘justification’ paragraphs of the Cabinet Memorandum marked"
"1R8  many  representations  have  been  made  to  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  also  to  the"
"Honourable  Minster  by 
individuals,  stakeholders  and  associations  quoting  various"
"discrepancies and discriminations resulting from the amendments in 1R7(b) and that the"
"procedure followed in making such amendments is wrong.  In the circumstances, I issue"
"a Writ of Prohibition, prohibiting the 1st to 3rd Respondents from taking any steps to fill"
"vacant posts in the Deputy Medical Administrative Grade of the Health (Medical) Service"
"otherwise than in terms of the said Service Minute (as amended by Extraordinary Gazette"
"Notification No. 2218/50 published on 09.03.2021) until the Public Service Commission"
"expressly  repeal  or  replace  any  provision  of  the  existing  Service  Minute  (as  amended)"
"concurring the Cabinet decision dated 12.07.2021."
"However, I am not inclined to issue a Writ of Mandamus as prayed for in the prayer of"
"the Petition as this Court does not wish to usurp the authority of 1st to 3rd Respondents in"
"deciding  as 
to  when 
the  existing  vacancies 
in 
the 
said  post  of  Deputy  Medical"
