"Gotabaya Jayaratne, Secretary Ministry of Education and others SC FR Application"
"No. 338/2012 decided on 07.09.2018, in which Prasanna Jayawardena J. has held that;"
"“Before parting with this issue, it is relevant to state that, at times material to this application,"
"the powers vested in the Cabinet of Ministers by Article 55 (1) of the Constitution to provide"
"for  and  determine  policy  relating  to  the  appointment  and  promotion  of  public  officers,"
"authorise the Cabinet of Ministers to direct that a Service Minute be amended or scrapped"
"altogether and replaced with another or to direct that a specific procedure be adopted to meet"
"the needs of specific circumstances, which are outside the compass of a Service Minute or are"
"not met by the provisions of a Service Minute. In HETTIARACHCHI vs. SENEVIRATNE"
"[1994 3 SLR 290], Fernando J, in a very brief judgment, expressed the view that the Cabinet"
"of Ministers is not necessarily bound to act in terms of Service Minute such as “P2”. “"
"“But, I would think  that, in the absence of a published directive issued by the Cabinet of"
"Ministers to adopt a special procedure and follow specified guidelines which are required by"
"reasons of policy and are based on objective and rational criteria, the Cabinet of Ministers"
"would be expected to act in terms of the existing Service Minute marked “P2” other than in"
"instances where a lacuna in “P2” is detected that and the Cabinet of Ministers acts specifically"
"for the purposes of addressing that lacuna.” [Emphasis added]"
