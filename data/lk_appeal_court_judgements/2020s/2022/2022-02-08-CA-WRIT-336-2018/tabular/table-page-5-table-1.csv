"Respondent on 18.11.2015 that the Petitionerâ€™s mother (the grantee) was not"
"in a proper mental condition when an inquiry was held by the 4th Respondent"
"on  04.11.2015,  two  weeks  prior  to  the  date  of  that 
letter  4R3.  The  2nd"
"Respondent  had  taken 
into  consideration  all  these  facts  and  come  to  the"
"conclusion that the officers in the Divisional Secretariat had not given thought"
"to  the  mental  capacity  of  the  grantee  in  nominating  successors.  Those  facts"
"taken together with the fact that the Petitioner had not  thought it fit to take"
"steps to quash the decision of the 2nd Respondent Provincial Land Commissioner"
"give rise to a presumption under Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance that the"
"2nd Respondent had performed those official acts regularly. Therefore, we see"
"no reason to issue a writ of mandamus to validate the first nomination in favour"
"of the Petitioner. There is no reason to issue a writ of certiorari to quash the"
"second nomination in favour of the 6th Respondent as it is already invalidated by"
"the 2nd Respondent."
"Therefore,  we  dismiss  the  applications  of  the  Petitioner  for  mandates  in  the"
"nature of writ of certiorari and mandamus. We make no order for costs of this"
"application."
