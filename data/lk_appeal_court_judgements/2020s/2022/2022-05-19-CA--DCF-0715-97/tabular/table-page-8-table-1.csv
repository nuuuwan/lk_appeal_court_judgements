"Even  though,  the  Plaintiff  has  instituted  the  instant  action  on  the  basis  that  Naris  and"
"Julis  had  died  unmarried  and 
issueless,  while  giving  evidence  at 
the 
trial  he  had"
"attempted to  say  that  said  Naris  and  Julis  had  not  contracted  legally  vailed  marriages"
"and therefore, David became the owner of the entire land sought to be partitioned. That"
"position of the  Plaintiff has  been based  on the  journal entry  dated 27.10.1965  (marked"
"පැ 3) of the case record in P 8179. According to that journal entry, the learned Counsel"
"who had appeared for Martin singho who was the plaintiff in that action had  submitted"
"to the Court that he is withdrawing the action for the reason that the vendor of the deed"
"in favour of Martin singho was not married to Julis and therefore, Martin singho cannot"
"maintain  the  action.  Martin  singho’s  rights 
to 
the 
land  had  been  based  on  a  deed"
"executed in his favour by a woman who had recited her title to the land as the wife of"
"Julis. In that journal entry, the learned Counsel who had appeared for the 11th and  12th"
"Defendants (the 1st and 2nd Defendants in the instant action) had submitted to the Court"
"that out of 4 children of Baba Appu, only David was married. The argument on  behalf"
"of the Plaintiff in the instant action has been that in view of the above stated submissions"
"recorded in the journal entry marked  පැ-3, the parties had admitted that Naris and Julis"
"had no legally  valid marriages  and therefore,  their rights  had been  devolved upon  their"
"brother, David. Other than the 1st and 2nd Defendants neither the Plaintiff nor the other"
"Defendants in the instant action  had been parties to the action  bearing  No. P 8179."
"Even though, the facts stated  in  පැ-3 had been recorded  as submissions of the  learned"
"Counsel appeared for the plaintiff and the 11th and 12th defendants in P 8179, those facts"
"were not recorded in that case as formal admissions  between the parties."
"When cross-examining  on 18.11.1982, 
the Plaintiff  has testified  thus;"
