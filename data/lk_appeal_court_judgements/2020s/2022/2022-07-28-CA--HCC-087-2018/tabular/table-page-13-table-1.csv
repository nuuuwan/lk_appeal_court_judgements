"T
he evidence against the appellant can be summarized as follows:"
"The incident happened in broad daylight. The appellant and the deceased PW1,"
"and  PW2  are  closely  related  people.  PW4  is  a  neighbor  of  the  appellant.  The"
"identity of the appellant is therefore not an issue at all.  When PW1 came to the"
"place  of  the  incident,  the  appellant  was  a  few  meters  away  from  the  place"
"where the deceased was lying with the injuries.  The appellant had the plastic"
"bottle  and  the  torch.    PW2  had  also  seen  the  appellant  near  his  water  tank"
"about  18  ft  away  from  where  the  deceased  was  lying.    The  appellant  made  a"
"confession to PW4 on the same day evening.  The appellant had  an animosity"
"towards  the  deceased  because  of  the  land  dispute.  The  police  had  found  a"
"plastic  bottle  and  a  torch 
to  the  statement  of  the 
(හුළු  අත්ත)  consequent"
"appellant.  The  dying  declaration  and  the  confession  collaborate  each  piece  of"
"evidence, other than the evidence of PW1 and PW2.  In view of the evidence of"
"the case, I am of the view that the case against the appellant is proved beyond"
"reasonable doubt and that the first ground of appeal has no merit."
"The second ground of appeal is that the learned Trial Judge has not evaluated"
"the dock statement properly. A considerable part of the judgment is devoted to"
"considering the defence evidence including the dock statement of the appellant."
"The  position  of  the  appellant  in  his  dock  statement  is  that  he  was  not  at  the"
"place  where  the  deceased  was  burnt.  He  had  gone  to  tether  his  cattle  and  he"
"got  to  know  of  the  incident  only  when  he  came  back  home.  He  also  said  that"
"PW4  gave  false  evidence,  but  he  did  not  attribute  any  reason  as  to  why  PW4"
"was doing so. As pointed out earlier the evidence regarding the confession was"
"not contested in the cross-examination. The appellant also said that the police"
"only came to his kitchen and did not go into the room to find the petrol bottle"
"or  the  torch.    The  evidence  of  PW1  and  PW2,  regarding  the  fact  that  the"
"appellant  was  there  within  a 
few  meters  away 
from  the  place  where  the"
"deceased  was 
lying  with  burnt 
injuries,  was  not 
challenged
