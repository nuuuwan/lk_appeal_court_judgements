"a
ttributing  an  untruthful  statement  to  the  accused,  the  words  spoken  to  by  the"
"witness  are  clear,  unambiguous  and  unmistakably  convey  that  the  accused  is"
"the  perpetrator  of  the  crime  and  nothing  is  omitted  by  the  witness  which  may"
"militate against it. After subjecting the evidence of the witness to a rigorous test"
"on the touchstone of credibility, the extra-judicial confession can be accepted and"
"can be the basis of a conviction if it passes the test of credibility.”"
"PW4  was  not  a  person  in  authority.  PW4  was  not  aware  of  the  incident  until"
"the  appellant  made  his  confession  to  her.  The  confession  was  not  sought  by"
"PW4. There was no question of any coercion or inducement on the part of PW4."
"The  confession  of  the  appellant  was  spontaneous 
in  the 
form  of  natural"
"response  to  his  own  horrific  deed.    PW4  can  be  regarded  as  an  independent"
"witness.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is  no  evidence  to  show  that  she  had  any"
"reasons  to  concoct  a  story  against  the  appellant  and  she  had  any  sort  of"
"animosity 
towards 
the  appellant.  Besides,  The  evidence  of  PW4  was  not"
"challenged  by  the  defence  in  cross-examination.  She  did  not  volunteer  to  the"
"police,  but  when  the  police  questioned  her  about  the  incident,  she  narrated"
"what  was  told  by  the  appellant.    In  the  circumstances,  no  adverse  inference"
"can  be  drawn  for  not  making  a  statement  to  the  police  immediately.  It  is"
"therefore clear that the confession of the appellant was made voluntarily. In the"
"case  of  Rahulan  vs  Attorney  General  [2006]  3  Sri  LR  253  it  was  held  that  a"
"voluntary confession can be the basis for a conviction."
"The law does not require that the evidence of  extra-judicial  confession should"
"in  all  cases  be  corroborated.  However,  coming  to  the  facts  of  this  case,  the"
"confession  of  the  appellant  is  amply  corroborated  by  the  other  evidence.  The"
"confession is reliable and trustworthy and the conviction can be based on it."
"In  addition  to  the  above-mentioned  evidence,  the  police  have  recovered  the"
"plastic petrol bottle and the torch (හුළු අත්ත) in consequence of the statement of"
"the appellant."
