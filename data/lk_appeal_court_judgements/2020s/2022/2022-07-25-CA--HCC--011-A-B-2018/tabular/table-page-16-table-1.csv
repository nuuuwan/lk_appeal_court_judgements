"In  sexual  offence  cases  corroboration  is  not  a  sine  qua  non  to  secure  a"
"conviction. As long as the victim’s evidence does not suffer from ambiguity"
"or infirmity in a manner which affects the root of the case, there is no bar for"
"the court to act and rely on the said evidence to decide the case."
"Hence, the argument put forward by the learned President’s Counsel under"
"this  ground  of  appeal  regarding  the  corroboration  cannot  be  accepted."
"Further,  as  stated  above,  in  this  case  the  prosecution  had  adduced  all"
"necessary  witnesses  to  prove  their  case.  It  is  incorrect  to  say  that  the"
"prosecution had withheld the independent witness to prove their case. Due"
"to reasons given above, this ground is also not successful."
"In the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the learned High"
"Court  Judge  failed  to  analyse  the  defence  and  to  arrive  at  a  decision  as"
"stipulated by law."
