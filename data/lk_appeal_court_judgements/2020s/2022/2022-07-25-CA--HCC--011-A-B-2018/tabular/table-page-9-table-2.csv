"Barry Nurcombe, M.D., F.R.A.C.P. in his article “The Child as Witnesses:"
"Competency and Credibility” states:"
"“Before  the  trial,  the  child  is  expected  to  recount  the  details  of  the"
"alleged  offense,  again  and  again, 
to  strangers.  Repeated  court"
"appearance  may  be  required.  In  court,  the  child  will  eventually  be"
"confronted by the accused who is exercising his or her constitutional"
"rights. In contrast to the accused, the child has no advocate. His or"
"her 
testimony 
is  open 
to  direct 
challenge  on 
the  grounds  of"
"incompetence,  confabulation  or 
fabrication.  These  considerations"
"deter  victims  from  reporting  offenses,  lead  to  false  restrictions,  and"
"erode the apparent credibility of honest witnesses”."
