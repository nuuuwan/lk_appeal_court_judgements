"Respondents. In this regard the Petitioners are relying upon the following passage of Lord"
"Denning in Macfoy vs. United Africa Co. Ltd (1931) 3 ALL ER 1169 (at. 1172);"
"“If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only bad, but incurably bad. There is"
"no need for an order of the court to set it aside. It is automatically null and void without more"
"ado,  though  it  is  sometimes  convenient  to  have  the  court  declare  it  to  be  so.  And  every"
"proceeding which is founded on it is also bad and incurably bad. You cannot put something"
"on nothing and expect it to stay here. It will collapse.”"
