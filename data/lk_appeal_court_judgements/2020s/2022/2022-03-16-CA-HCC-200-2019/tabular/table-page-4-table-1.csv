"T
herefore,  PW  1â€™s  evidence  and  other  evidence  adduced  in  respect  of"
"rape  and  grave  sexual  abuse  have  been  strongly  corroborated  by  the"
"medical  evidence.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  evaluated  the"
"relevant evidence and correctly found that the PW 1 has been raped and"
"sexually abused.  What the appellant denies is his involvement  in the"
"offences."
