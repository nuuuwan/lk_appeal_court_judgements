"immaterial whether the fact on which the evidence given is relevant to"
"the particular case or not and the witness is not reliable."
"I
t is to be noted that the learned High Court Judge has not decided that"
"the  witness  PW  1  or  PW  3  is  not  truthful  or  not  reliable.  What  the"
"learned  Judge  decided  was  that  they  gave  false  evidence  only  with"
"regard  to  their  illegal  affair.  The  learned  High  Court  Judge  decided"
"further that the evidence regarding the illegal affair could be separated"
"from the evidence relating to the offences pertaining to this case."
"I
n  the  case  of  State  of  Uttar  Pradesh  (Appellant)  Vs.  M.  K.  Anthony,"
"(Respondent) - Criminal Appeal No. 19 of 1976, Decided on- 6-11-1984"
"and reported in 1985 CRI. L. J. 493 - AIR 1985 Supreme Court 48; it"
"was held that “Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in some"
"details unrelated to the main incident because the power of observation,"
"retention  and  reproduction  differ  with  individuals”.  It  was  observed"
"further in the said Judgment that “Cross-examination is an unequal duel"
"between a rustic and refined lawyer”."
"I
n the instant action also, the PW 1 and PW 3 have given false evidence"
"to  conceal  their  illegal  affair.  It  is  natural  to  conceal  an  illegal  affair"
"because,  in  a  country  like  Sri  Lanka,  many  people  are  reluctant  to"
"expose an illegal relationship in public."
"I
n the case of Samaraweera V. Attorney General – (1990) 1 Sri L.R 256,"
"it was held that falsus in uno falsus in omnibus is not an absolute rule"
"which has to be applied without exception. It was held as follows:"
"“The maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus could not be applied"
"in such circumstances. Further, all falsehood is not deliberate. Errors of"
"memory, faulty observation or lack of skill in observation upon any point"
"or  points,  exaggeration  or  mere  embroidery  or  embellishment  must  be"
"distinguished from deliberate falsehood before applying the maxim. Nor"
"does the maxim apply to cases of testimony on the same point between"
