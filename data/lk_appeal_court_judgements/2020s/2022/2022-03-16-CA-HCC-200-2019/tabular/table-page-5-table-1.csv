"allegation  against  him  and  that  is  why  he  gave  evidence  in  order  to"
"establish his defence referring the incident of requesting the phone."
"I
n the case of R. v. Dossi - 13 Cr.App.R. 158 cited in Archbold Criminal"
"Pleading  Evidence  and  Practice  2019,  Paragraph  1-223  at  page  83;  it"
"was held as follows:"
"“A date specified in an indictment is not a material matter unless"
"it  is  an  essential  part  of  the  alleged  offence;  the  defendant  may  be"
"convicted  although  the  jury  finds  that  the  offence  was  committed  on  a"
"date  other  than  that  specified  in  the  incitement.  Amendment  of  the"
"indictment  is  unnecessary,  although  it  will  be  good  practice  to  do  so"
"(provided  that  there  is  no  prejudice  below)  where  it  is  clear  on  the"
"evidence that if the offence was committed at all, it was committed on the"
"day other than that specified”."
"I
n  the  instant  action,  it  is  clear  on  the evidence  that  the  offence  was"
"committed on the day that the prosecutrix requested the mobile phone"
"from  the  appellant  to  give  a  call.  In  considering  the  decision  of  the"
"aforesaid  judicial  authority,  the  relevant  facts  of  the  case  and  the"
"aforesaid  circumstances,  I  hold  that  discrepancy  on  the  date  of  the"
"offence had no effect on proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt."
"A
lthough  some  other  date  had  been  suggested  to  the  PW  1  by  the"
"prosecuting  counsel,  in  cross-examination,  PW  1  has  stated  the  date"
"mentioned in the indictment as the date of the incident. (Page 49 of the"
"appeal  brief)  She  stated  that  the  incident  took  place  on  29.07.2013"
"evening. She made the complaint to the police on 02.08.2013. Since the"
"victim is from a farming family in a rural area, it is not unusual, a delay"
"of two or three days in complaining to the police by someone in such a"
"situation.  This  slight  delay  has  no  effect  on  the  reliability  of  the"
"prosecution case."
