"The 
learned  counsel 
for 
the  appellant  did  not  contend  on  any"
"contradiction  or  omission  other  than  the  evidence  pertaining  to  the"
"illegal affair between PW 1 and PW 3. In addition, the learned counsel"
"contended that the posture in which she was allegedly held at the time"
"of the offence is highly impossible. The learned counsel pointed out that"
"she  has  said  that  vaginal  penetration  was  done  by  the  appellant"
"through  her  backside  and  the  accused-appellant  did  not  change  her"
"position at any time. The learned counsel pointed out further that she"
"said that she was lying on her back facing upwards when the appellant"
"raped her and he contended that the offence could not be committed"
"when she was in that position. However, it is my view that it is only a"
"mistake in describing the position she was in at that time. Although she"
"said that she was on her face upwards, she explained that her face was"
"downwards by answering the very next question. The relevant questions"
"and answers are as follows:"
"ප්‍ර: 
මමොන පැත්තටද ඔබව බිම මපරලුමේ ?"
"උ: 
උඩුබැලි අතට."
"ප්‍ර:  
එතම ොට ඔමේ මුහුණ මමොන පැත්තටද තිබුමේ?"
"උ: 
මුහුණ තිබුමේ යට පැත්තට."
"(Page 37 of the brief)"
"When  she  was 
facing  downwards,  vaginal  penetration  could  be"
"performed through her backside and there is no improbability on that."
