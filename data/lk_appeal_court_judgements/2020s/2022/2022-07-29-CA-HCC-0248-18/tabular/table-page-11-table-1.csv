"Based  on  the  evidence  of  the  victim  and  that  of  the  JMO,  I  find  that  the"
"prosecution  has  proved  the  penile  penetration  with  certainty,  hence,  no  basis"
"for the considered grounds of appeal."
"The 3rd Ground of Appeal: -"
"I find no basis whatsoever for the contention that the punishment imposed by"
"the learned High Court Judge was excessive."
"The 
judgment  cited  by 
the 
learned  Counsel 
in 
this  regard,  namely, 
the"
"judgment  in  the  case  of  The  Attorney  General  Vs.  Ranasinghe  and  Others"
"(1993) 2 SLR 81 was a case decided before the Penal Code (Amendment) Act"
"No 22 of 1995 came into being, under which the charge against the appellant"
"has  been  framed.  Under  the  amendment,  a  minimum  mandatory  punishment"
"was introduced under various classifications of the offence of rape."
"The  minimum  mandatory  punishment 
for  the  offence  of  rape 
in  terms  of"
"section  364(3),  which  was 
the  punishable  section  against 
the  appellant,"
"prescribes  a  minimum  mandatory  sentence  of  not  less  than  fifteen  years  and"
"not exceeding twenty years of rigorous imprisonment for a person who commits"
"rape, in addition to a fine."
"Since  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  imposed  the  minimum  mandatory"
"sentence  on  the  appellant  in  this  instance,  I  find  no  merit  in  the  considered"
"ground of appeal either."
"It needs to be noted that the evidence of the victim who was a minor at the time"
"of the incident was cogent and trustworthy as to what happened to her on that"
"fateful  day.  The  evidence  of 
(PW-02),  to  whom  the  victim  had  gone  and"
"informed  what  happened  to  her,  and  the  evidence  of  the  JMO  are  very  much"
"consistent  with  the  version  of  events  by  the  victim.  The  evidence  of  the  JMO"
