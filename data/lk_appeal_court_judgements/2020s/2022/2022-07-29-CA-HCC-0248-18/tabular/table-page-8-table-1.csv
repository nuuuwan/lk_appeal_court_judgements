"The Grounds of Appeal: -"
"At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated"
"the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court."
"(1) The evidence led in the action does not establish the offence of rape."
"(2) The learned High Court Judge failed to examine whether the evidence of"
"the  prosecutrix  and  the  medical  evidence  has  established  penetration"
"into the vaginal passage."
"(3) In any event the sentence is excessive."
"It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the evidence"
"of the prosecutrix in itself shows that it was not penile penetration but only an"
"attempt. He was of the view that medical evidence is also supportive of the fact"
"that there was no penetration into the vagina of the prosecutrix, hence, if at all,"
"the offence can only be sexual harassment in terms of section 345 of the Penal"
"Code. He contended further, that the sentence was too excessive given the facts"
"and the circumstances."
"It was the view of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) on behalf of the"
"Attorney  General  that  it  was  not  the  evidence  of  the  victim that  it  was  a  total"
"penetration. Pointing to the explanation of the word penetration as provided for"
"in the Penal Code, it was the contention of the learned DSG that the evidence"
"of the JMO has well established that there was penetration into the hymen and"
"vagina of the victim. It was his position that given the cogent and trustworthy"
"evidence  of  the  victim  and  the  other  witnesses  called  to  prove  the  case,  the"
"submissions with regard to the evidence of the victim has no basis. He brought"
"to the notice of the Court that the learned High Court Judge has imposed the"
"minimum  mandatory  sentence  that  can  be  imposed  for  an  accused  who  was"
"found guilty in terms of section 364(3) of the Penal Code."
