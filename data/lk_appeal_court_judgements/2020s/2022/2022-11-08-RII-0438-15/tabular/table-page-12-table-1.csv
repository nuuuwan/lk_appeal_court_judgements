"respect of final orders, judgments or sentences decided under Article 154P(3)(b) must be directed"
"to the Supreme Court."

"25. Section 11 in my opinion is an elaboration of Section 9(b) of the same Act, by virtue of which"
"right of appeal in respect of orders, judgments and sentences given in the Provincial High Court’s"
"original jurisdiction is vested in the Court of Appeal."
"26. The contention of the Respondents is that Section 9 of the Act read together with Section 11"
"of the same Act, rules out the Court of Appeal’s revisionary powers in respect of decisions arrived"
"under Article 154P(3)(b); i.e. orders, judgments and sentences given in the exercise of Provincial"
"High Court’s appellate jurisdiction. To put it simply, they argue that there can only be an appeal"
"from an instance where the High Court has exercised appellate jurisdiction. [It appears that this"
"should be correctly to a reference to “original” jurisdiction of the High Court of the Province]"
"27.  Respondents  further  argue  that  the  Court  of  Appeal’s  revisionary  powers  are  specifically"
"referred to in Section 11 of the Act, which limits itself to an order, judgment or sentence given by"
"the Provincial High Court pursuant to Article 154P(3)(a) and (4), exercising its original jurisdiction."
"They submit that the absence of any reference to Article 154P(3)(b) in Section 11, is illustrative of"
"the legislative intent to oust the Court of Appeal’s revisionary jurisdiction with regard to Provincial"
"High Court’s appellate jurisdiction."
"28. The  strength of this argument depends on the  maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius"
"which means that the express mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another. However, it"
"is my considered opinion that this maxim does not have absolute universal application. It is no"
"doubt a widely used aid of interpretation. Nevertheless, as observed in Somawathie v. Madawela"
"and others (1983) 2 SLR 15 at page 29, quoting Colquhoun v. Brooks (1888) 21 QBD 52, 65, “It is"
"often  a  valuable  servant,  but  a  dangerous  master  to  follow  in  the  construction  of  statutes  or"
"documents. The exclusio is often the result of inadvertence or accident, and the maxim ought not"
"to be applied when its application, having regard to the subject matter to which it is to be applied,"
"leads to inconsistency or injustice.”"
