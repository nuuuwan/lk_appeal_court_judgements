"Jurisdiction of the High Court of the Province."
"The said case said,"
"“As  already  noted  Article  154P(3)(a)  confers  original  criminal  jurisdiction  to  a  High  Court"
"established under  Article  154P. However, Article  154P(6) left out mentioning subsection (3)(a)"
"when it made provisions to the effect that “….any person aggrieved by a final order, judgment or"
"sentence of any such Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under paragraph 3(b) or 3(c) or (4)"
"may appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal”. The legislative gap is filled by the provisions of"
"section 12B of the Judicature (Amendment) Act No. 09 of 2018, with the conferment of a right to"
"appeal to the Supreme Court. In view of this clear statutory limitation, no appeal lies to the Court"
"of  Appeal,  when  a  High  Court  of  the  Provinces,  established  under  Article  154P,  exercises  its"
"original criminal jurisdiction”. (page 18)”"
