"thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all voids. On the"
"other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or"
"d
i
rectory, they say that, although such provision may not have been"
"complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever"
"the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many"
"provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly"
"obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material"
"i
mportance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the"
"l
egislature could have intended that the non-observance of them"
"should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the"
"other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the Court"
"would take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters"
"which must be strictly obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that"
"subsequently follow must come to an end‚Äù."
