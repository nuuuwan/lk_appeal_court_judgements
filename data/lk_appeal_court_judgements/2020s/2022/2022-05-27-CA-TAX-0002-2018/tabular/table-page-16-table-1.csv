"548, 370 P. 2d 124, “Generally speaking, statutory provisions directing"
"the mode of proceeding by public officers and intended to secure"
"order, system and dispatch in proceedings, and by a disregard of which"
"the rights of parties cannot be injuriously affected, are not regarded as"
"mandatory, unless accompanied by negative words importing that the"
"acts required shall not be done in any other manner or time than that"
"designated”. (p. 556. Emphasis added). A critical feature of mandatory"
"l
egislation  is  often  a  provision  for  the  consequences  of  non-"
"compliance. This element was noticed by early legal commentators, for"
"i
n
 
Bank v. Lyman, supra, we find this observation (p. 413).”"
