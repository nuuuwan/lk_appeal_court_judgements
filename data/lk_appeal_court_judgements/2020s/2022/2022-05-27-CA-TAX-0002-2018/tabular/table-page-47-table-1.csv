"[129] In this regard, it is significant to remember that the DTAA does not in"
"any way confine the powers of the Assessor under the Inland Revenue Act,"
"with regard to any assessment of assessee covered by the permission of"
"Indo-Sri  Lanka  DTAA.  A  DTAA  does  not  create  a  separate 
taxation."
"Accordingly, a DTAA cannot be used to impose any new tax on a person or"
"company when the domestic law imposes no tax.  In short, any DTAA acts"
"only as a shield against double taxation, and not as a sword to impose tax,"
"which  is  not  imposed  under  such  domestic  law  (Maralynne  A.  Monteith,"
"INBOUND  INVESTMENT  –  CROSS  BORDER  ISSUES,  National  Tax  Law  CLE"
"Program, 2011,p.2,http//www.cba.org/cha/cle/PDF/TAX11_Monteith_Paper.pdf)."
"[130] The object of the agreement is ""for the avoidance of double taxation"
"and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and"
"on capital.  The resulting position is that the Assessor or the Commissioner"
"General in Sri Lanka on its own cannot lawfully impose or waive or exempt"
"or reduce any tax imposed by Parliament except to the extent and in the"
"manner permitted by the Inland Revenue Act itself."
"[131]  As  the  Commentary  points  out,  the  provision  covering  permanent"
"establishment is based on situs and not on nationality, so that the benefit"
"of the non-discrimination clause applies to all residents of a treaty country"
"who,  regardless  of  nationality,  have  a  permanent  establishment 
(e.g.,"
"branch) in the other country (Commentary on OECD Model, Article 24)."
"Proof of offshore business"
"[132] The Appellant’s contention is that the Appellant, comparatively placed"
"in 
the  same  circumstances,  with  a  hypothetical  resident  company 
is"
"engaged 
in  the  same  activities  and  therefore,  the  Appellant  being  a"
"permanent  establishment,  shall  not  be  discriminated  and  treated 
less"
"favourably than any other resident company. It was the contention of Dr."
"Felix that the commercial invoices produced by the Appellant as indicated"
"in  the  Appeal  Report  establish  that  the  goods  were  purchased  and  sold"
"outside Sri Lanka and this matter is not disputed by the Respondent. He"
"referred to the observations  made by the  Assistant Commissioner in the"
"Appeal Report (pp.109-113)."
"[133]  Now  the  question  is  whether  the  Appellant,  comparatively  being"
"placed in similar circumstances with a hypothetical non-resident having a"
"permanent establishment under the DTAA is entirely engaged in offshore"
"business for the purpose of the exemption under Section 13 (b)(ii)."
