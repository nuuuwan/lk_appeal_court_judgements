"been made by the buyers directly to the HSBC Bank at, No. 24, Sir Baron"
"Jayathilaka Mawatha, Colombo 01, Sri Lanka, which indicates that payments"
"are  not  directly  sent  by  the  buyers  to  the  Appellant’s  offshore  agents  or"
"offshore  banks,  but  direct  to  the  HSBC  Bank,  in  Sri  Lanka.  This  is  also"
"suggestive of the fact that payments are not directly sent by the buyers to"
"the  Appellant’s  offshore  agents  or  offshore  banks,  but  direct 
to 
the"
"Appellant’s bank located in Sri Lanka."
"[143] On the other hand, the entire turnover had been remitted to Sri Lanka"
"by  the  buyers  (p.  110  of  the  brief)  and  NOT  by  any  employee,  agent  or"
"representative  of  the  Appellant  located  outside  Sri  Lanka.    This  is  also"
"suggestive of the fact that payments are not directly sent by the buyers to"
"the  Appellant’s  offshore  agents  or  offshore  bank,  but  direct 
to 
the"
"Appellant’s bank located in Sri Lanka."
"[144]  Another  factor  that  determines  the  offshore  business  of  a  trading"
"company is that goods are not manufactured or produced in Sri Lanka or"
"imported into Sri Lanka for trading purposes. The Tax Appeals Commission"
"has taken the view that the Appellant is also involved in local sales as sales"
"of some of the items take place in Sri Lanka and therefore, the Appellant is"
"not involved in offshore business as specified in Section 13(b)(ii) of the IRA"
"(pp 179 of the TAC brief)."
"[145] The Appellant states that it is involved in both local sales and offshore"
"sales (statement of account at page 94 of the TAC brief) and that the local"
"sale component has been taxed in Sri Lanka. It was the contention of Dr."
"Felix that the tax exemption claimed only related to the offshore business"
"and there is no prohibition for one entity to have a local business and an"
"offshore  business.  His  contention  was  that  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission"
"has  erred  when  it  made  a  reference  to  the  local  sales  taking  place  in  Sri"
"Lanka  as  admittedly 
there  are  no  undeclared 
sales.  The  Assistant"
"Commissioner having perused the commercial documents has found that"
"only the goods are transferred (purchase and sale) outside Sri Lanka by the"
"Appellant  and  all  other  activities  in  relation  to  this  business  transactions"
"have been carried out in Sri Lanka (p. 110 of the TAC brief)."
"[146] Admittedly, the principal activities of the Appellant also include export"
"of  medical  equipment,  import  and  wholesale  business  of  cosmetics  and"
"baby care items. It is not in dispute that the goods purchased and sold to"
"customers by the Appellant outside Sri Lanka also related to those activities"
"of 
the  Appellant 
(medical  equipment-Vide  pp.  11-18).  Under
