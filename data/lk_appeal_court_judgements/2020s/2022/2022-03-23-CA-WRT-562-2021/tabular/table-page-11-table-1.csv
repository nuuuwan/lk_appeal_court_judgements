"challenge the decision-making process of such formal inquiry. Moreover, this Court makes"
"the  observation  that  the  members  of  the  Committee  appointed  to  hold  the  formal"
"disciplinary inquiry should conclude the inquiry expeditiously following the due process."
"In the circumstances, I am convinced that the allegations against the Petitioners are yet to"
"be inquired in to at the formal disciplinary inquiry and the alleged conduct of the Petitioner"
"is,  prima  facie,  a  flagrant  violation  of  discipline  in  the  University  which  disturbs  the"
"smooth administration of the authorities for the benefit of majority of students. Therefore,"
"I am of the view that the Petitioner has no lawful ground  at this stage  to maintain this"
"application and also to seek any discretionary relief from this Court. Hence, I proceed to"
"refuse this application."
