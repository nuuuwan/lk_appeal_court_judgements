"commentary  to  Vajjian  Constitution  which  is  to  my  mind  deliberates  astonishingly  an"
"inquiry process until the accused is being punished. The said commentary reads;"
"“As for the ‘ancient Vajjian constitution’ it is said that when a thief was brough before the"
"ancient Vajjian rulers, they handed him over to the judicial officers (vinicchaya-mahamatta)."
"They investigated the facts and if they thought that he was not a thief they released him but"
"if  they  suspected  that  he  was  a  thief,  they  handed  him  over  to  the  magistrates  (voharika)"
"without  making  any  statement  themselves.  They  in  turn  investigated  matters  and  if  they"
"thought he was not a thief they released him but if they suspected that he was a thief they"
"made him over to the justices (sutta-dhara)…they in turn to a panel of eight judges (attha-"
"kulika)…they in turn to the president, who investigated the case and if he thought that he"
"was not a thief, released him but if he was convinced that the was a thief called for the book"
"of precedents (paveni-potthaka). There it is written down that such and such was punishment"
"for such and such an offence. The president, thereupon compared his offence with those and"
"ordered the appropriate punishment. Thus, the people who abided by the ancient Vajjian"
"constitution had no grouse (against the state) because justice was done in accordance with the"
"ancient  tradition  and  they  felt  that  if  anyone  was  at  fault  it  was  themselves  and  not  the"
"officials (of the state). And as a result, they performed their tasks with a sense of responsibility."
"In this way the state prospered2”."
