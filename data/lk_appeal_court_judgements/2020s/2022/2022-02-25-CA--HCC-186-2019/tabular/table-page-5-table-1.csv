"appellantâ€™s brother, other than the utterances made by the appellant on that, to PW1."
"Even if one assumes that there had been such an assault on the brother of the appellant"
"as  uttered  by  the  appellant,  there  is  no  evidence  as  to  when  such  assault  has  taken"
"place to prove that the provocation was so sudden that the appellant did not have time"
"for the sudden heat of passion to cool. Hence, there is no evidence for the appellant to"
"get the benefit of exception 1 of section 294 of the Penal Code to lessen the offence of"
"murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. On the above premise, I find"
"that the grounds of appeal urged on behalf of the appellant are devoid of merit. Hence,"
"the conviction and the sentence imposed on the appellant by the learned High Court"
"Judge is affirmed."
