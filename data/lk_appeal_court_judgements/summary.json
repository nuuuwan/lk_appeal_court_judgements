The same permit holder held two plots of land, one on permit issued under the Land Development Ordinance, and the other one\u2019s permit was on the pipeline to be issued. The widow never made an application to succeed within the time stipulated as she had also died within sixteen months of the death of the original permit holder. The Divisional Secretary decided to amalgamate both lands and divided into equal shares among all the children. The Petitioner successfully invoked the jurisdiction of this Court to obtain a Writ of Certiorari and Mandamus to declare him as the successor in respect of the plot of land held under permit.",
