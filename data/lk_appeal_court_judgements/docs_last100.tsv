Dr. D. F. H. Gunawardhana, J.	The Petitioner being the eldest child of the original permit holder, who had died and nominated his wife as the successor, sought to be substituted. The same permit holder held two plots of land, one on permit issued under the Land Development Ordinance, and the other one’s permit was on the pipeline to be issued. The widow never made an application to succeed within the time stipulated as she had also died within sixteen months of the death of the original permit holder. The Divisional Secretary decided to amalgamate both lands and divided into equal shares among all the children. The Petitioner successfully invoked the jurisdiction of this Court to obtain a Writ of Certiorari and Mandamus to declare him as the successor in respect of the plot of land held under permit.

The original grantee had passed away without nominating a successor; thus, his spouse became the life interest holder in terms of Section 48B of the Land Development Ordinance. She had nominated the 5th Respondent, who is the sibling of the Petitioner, as the successor, which was accepted and registered by the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner challenged the said acceptance and registration of the 5th Respondent as the successor. Writ of Certiorari issued since the decision contravenes Section 48B. However, refused to issue a Writ of Mandamus to consider the Petitioner as the successor to the life interest holder since that question does not arise until her demise.

The dispute was referred to arbitration, and the arbitral award in favour of the 2nd Respondent was granted. When the Petitioner challenged the said arbitral award, notice was refused since the arbitrator is justified in granting the award after having properly considered all the evidence.

It is not merely a crime; it is a curse that strikes at the very heart of the community. It leaves psychological scars on the victims and instils fear among women in society. Addressing this harrowing issue is essential for fostering safety, respect and dignity for all – The issue concerns the fact that the sentence is disproportionate and excessive - Determination of the appropriate punishment to sex offenders – Aggravating circumstances as regards to the offence of rape.

The Magistrate Court refused to entertain a charge based on that; however, entertained a charge of criminal trespass. Writ is sought against the police, compelling them to charge the said three-wheel drivers with public nuisance.
