Jayasinghe Vs Senior Deputy Inspector of Police of the Western Province and Others	Hon. Dr. D. F. H. Gunawardhana, J.	The Petitioner, as an entrepreneur, had invested money in an apartment housing complex by purchasing shares thereof — a nuisance caused by certain three-wheel drivers, parking their three- wheels, causing a hindrance at the entrance of the housing complex. The Petitioner made a police complaint for the police to prosecute them for public nuisance. The Magistrate Court refused to entertain a charge based on that; however, entertained a charge of criminal trespass. Writ is sought against the police, compelling them to charge the said three-wheel drivers with public nuisance. Application was refused since evidence has to be considered, and the Petitioner can still obtain relief from the District Court.	The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka

However, before the commencement of the trial, the Petitioner sought the intervention of the writ court to obtain a writ compelling the District Court Judge to dismiss the action for the want of proper identification of the corpus.

Though the writ court is empowered to issue writs, when there is no allegation of irrationality, act of ultra vires affecting the rights of the parties, or acted without evidence, no writ lies.
