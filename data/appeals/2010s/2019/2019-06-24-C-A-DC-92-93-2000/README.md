Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action to partition the land described in

the schedule to the plaint. Several parties have intervened pending

action. After trial the learned District Judge delivered the

Judgment partitioning the land among the plaintiff, the 1st and 2nd

defendants and some others who are not parties to the action.

Being dissatisfied with the Judgment, the 2A defendant and 3rd

defendant have preferred appeals. The 3rd defendant did not

pursue the appeal, and there remains to consider the appeal of the

2A defendant.

The 2nd defendant did not give evidence at the trial. The pivotal

argument of the learned counsel for the 2A defendant is that the

land to be partitioned was already amicably partitioned by Plan

marked 1D5 prepared in 1963 and Deed of Partition marked 1D6

executed in 1964, and accordingly, the 2nd defendant became

entitled to Lot 1, the plaintiff to Lot 2, and the 1st defendant to Lot

3 in the said Plan, and those Lots were thereafter registered at the

Land Registry as separate Lots, and therefore, the partition action

should have been dismissed or Lot 1 should have been excluded

from the corpus.

This argument is unacceptable on two grounds. One is, all the co-

owners had not been parties to the amicable partition, and the

other is, after the amicable partition, admittedly, the 2nd defendant

has executed Deeds alienating undivided rights from the land to

several others including the plaintiff and the 4th defendant. The

2nd defendant, by raising issue Nos. 30 and 31, whilst accepting

execution of two Deeds in favour of the plaintiff and the 4th

defendant, has taken up the position that, at the time of execution,

he did not have title to the said land! Execution of Deeds

3

alienating undivided rights after the alleged amicable partition cuts

across the said argument.

There is no doubt that the amicable Partition Plan and the

amicable Deed of Partition executed thereon have not been acted

upon, and the principal argument of the 2A defendant-appellant is

therefore not entitled to succeed. Lot 1 shall form part of the

corpus.

Learned counsel for the 2A defendant in the written submission

has stated that the learned District Judge has miscalculated some

shares. How it happens is not very clear. Calculation of shares is

referable to the pedigree. The 2A defendant has not raised a

pedigree dispute at the trial and therefore he cannot raise a

pedigree dispute for the first time in appeal. In any event, the 2A

defendant has not stated how such miscalculation, if at all there is

one, has affected him.

Learned counsel for the 2A defendant further says that although

the learned District Judge has given shares to Sendiris and

Andrayas, there was no evidence, at least, to establish they were

among the living. The learned District Judge has in the Judgment

given some shares to three persons who are not parties to the

action. That is not necessary. Either they should have been made

parties to the case or those shares should have been left

unallotted. Hence the shares given to those three persons who are

not parties to the case shall be left unallotted.

Subject to that variation, the Judgment of the District Court is

affirmed and the appeal is dismissed but without costs.
